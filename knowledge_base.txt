Visit Mesa CEO Launches New AI Roadmap Aug 25 Written By Greg Oates Visit Mesa in Arizona kicked off a new internal initiative this week to integrate AI processes and platforms across the organization. I worked with Visit Mesa to help develop their new DMO AI Roadmap, which provides a 5-phase strategic framework that most any visitor organization can use as a template. The project officially began this week during Visit Mesa’s spring board meeting to communicate why the organization is moving forward with AI to optimize the DMO’s value for Mesa’s visitor industry and the local community. Marc Garcia, CATP , president and CEO of Visit Mesa, has been eager to start this initiative. He was one of the dozen CEOs who contributed to the first GuideGeek Destination AI story a few months back, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI. For that deep dive into a CEO's mindset regarding AI, Garcia asked: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” The Visit Mesa DMO AI Roadmap answers those questions. “I've recognized that AI is extremely important not only for the world moving forward, but specifically for our industry,” Garcia explained at the beginning of this project. “We at Visit Mesa need to get out in front of it. Even as a small to medium-sized DMO with our budget, we've always taken pride in the fact that we’re typically at the forefront of the latest and greatest in terms of technology, and so this is just an extension of that.” The following is a high-level overview of the DMO AI Roadmap and each of the five phases. However, like all strategic planning, there is a big jump between developing a plan and executing it effectively. This is especially true with internal AI training. In any given organization today, there is often a wide breadth of how people perceive AI and how proficient they are with AI models. It will take time to educate and align everyone around shared benefits for the organizations and staff, expected processes, intended outcomes and success metrics. Visit Mesa AI Roadmap The DMO AI Roadmap is a structured, phased approach for educating staff and integrating AI across DMO departments. The goals for the roadmap are to optimize internal operations, enhance sales and marketing outcomes, inspire staff self-learning, future-proof the organization, and contribute to how well local industry and community leaders adopt AI best practices and benefit from them. There are two imperatives that should be established and agreed upon among leadership at the very beginning. Integrating AI processes and platforms is an imperative for the DMO to ensure its relevancy and long-term impact in the local visitor economy. If leadership doesn’t fully believe that, this strategic framework won’t work. AI proficiency is an imperative for staff members for their future growth and marketability. That said, you can’t really force people to embrace, learn and use AI intentionally, but the job market will. The following phases are highly fluid and some of the processes can be rolled out concurrently. Ultimately, these phases provide structure for effectively and responsibly implementing a new technology that has no precedent. Because of generative AI, machines can now do three things they haven’t been able to do before. They have the ability to reason, the ability to communicate, and the ability to generate stuff based on that reasoning and communication. Meaning, AI is messy. Integrating it into our daily workflows is also messy because it's challenging us to rethink our relationship with technology. But as Kate Yordi, director of marketing at Visit Mesa, said during the board meeting this week, “Finally, we have some direction.” Phase 1: Leadership Alignment & Staff Communication As discussed at length in previous Destination AI posts, the DMO CEO must make it clear to all staff that the organization prioritizes AI because the organization prioritizes being relevant. It certainly helps, as is the case with Visit Mesa, when the CEO is fully backed by the board to invest in AI integration. During the board meeting, one member asked, “What do you need from us, Marc?” That’s a good sign. For the DMO AI Roadmap to work, all leadership needs to not only have a basic understanding of AI tools, they need to actually use them as well on a regular basis. That goes a long way in driving agency across the organization. However, making that happen typically requires some C-suite training to explain the primary AI models more indepth: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot and/or Google Gemini depending on the specific workplace platform(s) the organization uses. Identifying and prioritizing just a handful of AI models like that brings a lot of clarity to the process right off the bat. You see people's shoulders relax when they're confronted with 5-6 AIs versus dozens. (Yes, VEED, Gamma, Manus, Sora, Granola, Slack AI, etc., are all really cool but let's not start there.) A common lament among DMO leadership related to AI is, “Where do we even start?” Leadership should then discuss and begin to answer the five big questions all CEOs face when navigating AI integration, as vetted in the aforementioned Destination AI post about what CEOs want regarding AI education: How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI (who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI) to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and quality of work? How do we redevelop our content and channels to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI for business purposes to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The next step in this phase, at a basic level, is communicating to staff why they’re being asked to embrace AI. The following is not meant to be comprehensive, but a CEO would likely want to articulate: The purpose of the AI Roadmap, guiding principles, and the phases and processes involved How AI integration will take time and people will evolve at different paces It’s ok if everyone feels like they’re building the plane while flying it Everyone is encouraged to use AI and will be supported, but there will also be guardrails in place AI adoption and use cases will become part of employee reviews, but traditional roles, responsibilities and key success metrics are still the priority "How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents." — Marc Garcia, president and CEO, Visit Mesa Phase 2: Staff Assessment & AI Task Force Sitting down and asking staff how they feel about AI and how/if they’re using it is a good way to begin. Depending on the size of the organization, this can be done with every staff member individually or a representative group from each department. Generally people fall into three camps when it comes to AI: 1) Those who are already using AI on a regular basis; 2) those who are curious and have experimented a bit, but they don’t actively engage with AI tools; and 3) those who don’t see much value in AI. This last group can also include people who outright oppose AI, but they make themselves apparent pretty quickly. Data also shows there is often a significant percentage of staff who use AI in secret because they’re not sure they’re allowed to use it for work purposes. The second way to collect staff sentiment and AI capacity is with a blind online survey asking everyone what they like about AI, what concerns them, how they feel about job security, what they want to learn, what they hope to achieve, etc. Everything is anonymous so you can expect a wide variety of feedback ranging from constructive/optimistic to fears of an impending robot apocalypse. Once complete, all the data should be synthesized into key takeaways for leadership and shared with staff to show a high level of transparency right from the beginning of this process. The second part of this phase is developing an AI task force. The value of this cannot be overemphasized. Choose a small group of AI champions from various departments to do three things: Provide direction for stewarding the various processes in each phase as effectively as possible from beginning to end Share constructive and thoughtful input they’re hearing from other staff members about how things are proceeding well and where there are challenges Help scale AI adoption across teams by showing how they’re using AI effectively to everyone else in the organization An internal AI task force or council is invaluable because the members are motivated and they want to learn. Mostly, their enthusiasm and success with AI will begin to rub off on many of their colleagues and inspire self-learning and greater adoption among the teams. But not all. There will be those who disengage, and there can be a significant number of them. Over time, they should be consulted to understand their trepidation, which should then be addressed. This is a challenge I'm having with one organization where a significant cohort are saying they're too busy to learn AI. Meanwhile, the majority of the staff are reporting daily usage with effective results, which definitely wasn't the case a few months ago. And even with those leaning in, the level of improvement and AI Iearning will be slow at times. This is why it’s critical for the CEO and the rest of management to be all-in and consistently participate in staff training sessions to show direction, intention and support. It’s very easy for the novelty of AI training to wear off after the first few months. This is where the AI task force can be instrumental to help maintain overall staff interest and keep engagement levels as high as possible. "Finally, we have some direction." — Kate Yordi, director of marketing, Visit Mesa Phase 3: AI Policy & Investments Developing an official AI policy and governance manual accomplishes two primary objectives: It protects the organization against legal and financial liability by establishing how all employees are required to use AI responsibly. It encourages and gives license for staff to proactively experiment with AI because there are clear guidelines in place about how to do so. There are many DMOs who have created AI policies and are willing to share with the rest of the industry. These are typically not lengthy documents (3-4 pages) nor full of legalese. Generally they’re written so every single employee can understand everything in them. Sections in these policies often include: Positioning/Purpose Statement: Expresses how and why the organization needs to be intentional about implementing AI processes Primary Objectives and Intended Outcomes: Defines the business case for how the organization is attempting to deliver on its core mandate of driving revenue to local businesses in alignment with community priorities Guiding Principles: Establishes the principles of responsible AI use in alignment with the values of the organizations related to themes such as inclusivity, bias, authenticity, veracity, collaboration, knowledge sharing, etc. AI Definitions: Provides clear explanations of AI terminology used in the document and workplace AI Tools: Identifies specific AI models that the organization provides access to Data Input: Dictates clear rules about what employees can upload into AI models and what they can’t upload, such as personal information of any person Monitoring: Defines how the organization reserves the right to monitor AI practices Training & Support: Defines opportunities for professional growth and learning AI on an ongoing basis There are other items that DMOs might include in the above list, and they vary depending on how HR, financial and legal departments interpret AI governance, but it serves as a foundation. One key consideration for DMO leadership when it comes to policy is identifying which pro AI models to invest in. Paid AI tools provide higher levels of privacy and security because AI companies don’t train on them, or at least there’s the choice to select that option. Many DMOs, for example, purchase annual subscriptions for paid ChatGPT Team accounts ($25 per employee monthly) for staff to use for work, which is a first step for protecting the IP and other interests of the organization. Other paid AI models are then provided to specific departments based on need and the specific attributes of the tools, such as Claude for marketing and social media staff because many consider it the best AI for content creation. Phase 4: AI Education & Implementation This is the most important thing in training teams to embrace and use AI effectively. You want to foster an environment where structured learning evolves into self-learning. That’s the only way this scales. When staff members with little experience in AI start exploring how to use AI on their own, and they start helping their colleagues see new ways to use AI, that’s a pretty special thing. From an education standpoint, the DMO AI Roadmap begins at a high level defining AI’s place in online history. AI is the third transformational shift since the PC was invented, including: The mainstream web/internet in the 1990s; the evolution of mobile/social/cloud and apps in the 2000s; and gen AI in the 2020s. These are the only three times when big tech went all-in and pivoted their business models around a new technology. I then break AI training into the following buckets, and again, this is all very surface level and not meant to be comprehensive. Also, creating engaging demos are everything, and that's not also easy because AI demos can be a real slog sometimes. But, showing how different AIs provide real value is key for people to internalize their learning and use it more intuitively over time: Explain how pre-gen AI tech is deterministic and gen AI is probabilistic, which messes with a lot of people’s minds. Gen AI outputs are based on statistical patterns and probabilities, just like the human brain processes ideas and information. Traditional tech is based on absolutes, delivering the same output based on the same input. Old tech is about information. AI is about knowledge. Spend a lot of time on this with workshops and demos. Highlight the capabilities of only three AI models to start: ChatGPT for brainstorming and planning; Claude for writing and data analysis; and Perplexity for conversational search. The other two, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, are more general purpose. They also do amazing things (Gemini 2.5 Pro is great for reasoning), but focusing on the first three will provide direction at the beginning so people don’t get overwhelmed. At the very minimum, leadership should have a basic understanding of those three. Explain how AI search isn't 100% perfect but it's a 1,000% better than old search. Define how DMOs and all brnads are redesigning their websites and content strategy to optimize for AI search, and the basics of AI SEO . I would argue the most important thing for using AI is really understanding how generative AI = conversational AI. It's a dialogue. It's called "chat" for a reason. This is where I’ve heard the most positive feedback from teams I’ve worked with. It happens when people move beyond the Google mindset—where search is one and done—and they see the real value of iterative conversations with AI models that evolve with each exchange in the discussion, just like a human conversation. This also removes some misperceptions about how to prompt. Yes, there are some basic rules about how to prompt well. But beyond that, it’s vastly more beneficial to explore AI conversations further with thoughtful follow-up prompts that flow logically and organically to achieve the best results. Explore how the real value of AI extends beyond just efficiency and productivity gains. That's a dangerous dialogue with staff who can construe that as leading to more work or being terminated over time. The bigger value and better narrative is how AI increases creativity and knowledge, and how those both influence overall quality of work, marketing effectiveness, sales productivity, staff culture and pride, job satisfaction and growth opportunities, etc. Really dig into the advanced features of the paid models: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro. Aside from the added security and privacy they provide, they offer functions not available in the free models and their outputs are significantly better. ChatGPT Projects and custom GPTs, Claude Projects and Perplexity Spaces are where the magic happens. Create an environment where staff members are eager to share their successes with AI with the rest of the organization. This feedback loop is critical for steering education and driving adoption, and it’s one of the most important roles for the internal AI task force. AI-training meetings can be highly effective during video calls but they often have the greatest impact during in-person workshops. Also, make sure to give staff a specific amount of hours during the week to develop their AI skills. Explore options for AI chat platforms and the benefits they provide for visitors and local industry partners. I work with Matador Network, which developed the industry leading GuideGeek AI chat platform. The feedback from 35+ DMO clients is impressive and irrefutable, but there is still much work to do educating visitors and industry about AI chat strategy and their benefits to continually increase adoption and business outcomes. The DMO AI Roadmap also provides guidance for developing various learning and engagement formats: Schedule weekly or bi-weekly meetings specifically, and only, for AI training with both internal and external people sharing insights Create a library of AI educational materials for staff to reference Start a weekly internal AI newsletter to share how teams are using AI Start a Slack or similar channel dedicated for AI education, AI news updates, knowledge sharing, etc Start a weekly and optional one-hour AMA meeting for everyone to ask everyone else questions (highly effective) Create a regular schedule for staff to report back to leadership or department heads about how they’re using AI and what they’re achieving with it Phase 5: Success Tracking I kick off every AI presentation identifying the three AI models mentioned above—ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity—followed by the assertion that, "AI is the death of 'I don't know.'" That is arguably the biggest ROI for integrating AI in a DMO or any other type of organization. There are few questions that are too complex or too intimidating for DMO staff to approach with confidence and conviction if they know how to use those three AI models effectively. I shared an example previously where I used Perplexity Pro to educate myself about how board governance is evolving . That for me was something I knew was out of my realm of expertise, but now I feel I can speak with some semblance of authority about that to any board because of AI. Before gen AI, I dismissed board governance as one of those things I'd just have to leave in the dark. That said, trying to explain how AI helps staff become more self-reliant, where they can always build a foundation of understanding for anything to empower themselves, only goes so far with a board. They're looking for more quantitative KPIs. Here are just some examples of that in a DMO context. In 2025, defining KPIs for AI integration is an evolving science, and we as an industry are still figuring a lot of this out. Therefore, this list is nowhere near comprehensive and it will evolve, but we have ample data today to validate the following: Using AI for search and content development saves significant time and increases opportunities for higher output and increased creativity for producing blog posts, social media, videos, marketing campaigns, etc. Developing custom GPTs (in ChatGPT Plus) for group sales is a proven strategy for creating better, more customized proposals in much less time. That gives sales staff more time for brainstorming and prospecting leading to higher production. That's a fact. In this case, group sales people are actually pumped to try a new technology. Using AI for regression analysis and scenario modeling increases the accuracy of how DMOs predict visitor volumes year-round, event attendance, economic impact, etc. One of the biggest conversations in DMOs today is how to develop content and websites to rank higher in AI search. Developing best practices in AI SEO leads to higher traffic. That is a core mandate for any DMO, and no DMO can afford to ignore that over time. AI chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI are driving real business. As described in PhocusWire in March, New York City Tourism + Conventions launched its GuideGeek-powered "Ellis" meeting-specific AI chat in January. ROI to date: 100% increase in traffic to the meeting planner website, 800+ AI-driven queries in the first month, 50% growth in newsletter sign-ups, and 10% increase in time spent on the site. Summary The AI train has left the station and it's gaining steam. The DMO AI Roadmap is the next logical step for helping DMO CEOs and their teams integrate AI processes and platforms. As Visit Mesa's Kate Yordi said, "Finally, we now have direction." That's a big deal for DMO staff to feel that way. Generative AI has been with us for more than two years now, but a structured and phased approach for integrating AI across DMO departments has been the missing piece. Visit Mesa's DMO AI Roadmap is going to evolve as the team works through the process, but at least now there's a vision and scope. Visit Mesa CEO Marc Garcia and the board are fully committed—a critical first step for embarking on this journey. Also, this strategic framework for how DMOs approach AI is going to underpin the interactive AI Playground activation at U.S. Travel's upcoming ESTO conference in Phoenix, August 17-19. U.S. Travel and GuideGeek are partnering to develop educational programming for the hands-on AI training experience and series of thought leadership. Greg Oates

How AI Improves DMO and Community Master Planning Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Many DMOs are developing 10-year destination master plans to optimize their visitor economy in alignment with local community priorities. I've participated in producing dozens of them from Miami to Mesa. They often take as long as a year to complete because there's so much focus on community engagement in various formats: interviews, focus groups, town halls, surveys, visioning sessions, etc. The tourism industry talks about the importance of community a LOT. However, when you're working with a DMO, you never really dig into what actually moves the needle across so many endless community demands, not on a tactical and hyperlocal level. You're not really held accountable for any measure of success when it comes to community-specific initiatives, ranging from improving City Hall permitting processes for small businesses to tracking the movement of unhoused. A master plan needs to address those and amplify those kinds of pressing needs for the destination overall. The expectation is not really to fix them. That’s not the role of a DMO. It's a whole different ballgame when you're developing a long-term strategic framework for a community organization like Near Southside, Inc . in Fort Worth. Success and being accountable for fixing things is expected. Located at the periphery of the downtown core, Near Southside is the most interesting community in North America right now. The ex-industrial district can be loosely compared to Austin 20 years ago with the same cultural DNA and similar community values, based on a fiercely protective love for local, creative and independently owned small businesses. That's under threat. In the last few years, as Near Southside evolved into the coolest 'hood east and west of the Pecos Line, real estate prices are rising commensurately. We all know how this story often ends with the encroachment of national brands sanitizing the soul of a place that made it attractive in the first place. Near Southside is intent on rewriting that story. AI Processes for Strategic Planning Here's where AI comes in. Because of the multitude of overlapping challenges and evolving dynamics in the community, our team needs to crunch and debate a ton of qualitative and quantitative data. Addressing gentrification touches on so many aspects of how communities operate. Therefore, we are over-indexing on community engagement to get as many perspectives as possible to identify how the community best evolves in the face of rapid change. The amount of inputs we're getting is substantive, and we want to inventory all of it as thoroughly as possible to build a super comprehensive knowledge base for the AI to cull through, connect dots and output insights. Every individual zoom call with stakeholders is recorded with Granola AI, which produces full transcripts but the summaries are too light. So we created custom GPTs with instructions for everything we want in the summaries, including comprehensive overviews, key takeaways with detailed context for each, the most insightful quotes related to those takeaways, and all action items that stakeholders recommended. With the GPT, we can fire full transcripts into the chat, press "enter" and receive highly valuable, high quality and uniform summaries almost immediately. We're doing the same with the focus groups but the custom GPTs require a different set of instructions. The two-hour transcripts capture the conversations with 10-20 stakeholders convened across specific industry and community segments. For those, the GPTs bucket corresponding high-level takeaways and tactical action items related to the same theme. That has immeasurable value because these conversations are all over the place. It's great working with locals who are so passionate about where they live and how, but that means you're getting feedback from a firehose and someone taking notes doesn’t capture all the nuance. Using custom GPTs to produce these summaries and populate takeaways is as good or better than any team could do manually. Everything is stored in Airtable. Forget Google or Microsoft cloud platforms. Airtable is an AI-powered, relational database/spreadsheet beast for organizing data and automating basic workflows. The tables combine all project information in one place, such as a running list of pending/completed interviews and focus groups and their AI-generated summaries. Airtable can then auto-generate a summary of the summary in the same table for clients to easily review everything being collected on a daily basis to whatever degree they prefer. Once you use Airtable, you'll never look at Google Drive the same way again. I've never had so many insights so well organized, so thorough and so easy to share with a team and client to help inform each project phase. The client loves the transparency, immediacy and structure, naturally, versus waiting for the next weekly update to read a few bullet points in a PowerPoint. Here's the thing. Because we've been so intentional about collecting such a high quality and comprehensive volume of feedback, we have a motherlode of a knowledge base for AI to work with. We can then enter all that in bulk into Google NotebookLM or ChatGPT/Claude Projects to pull out anything from high-level aggregate takeaways to anything super customized or tactical. For example, the client was interested in hearing specifically just what developers had to say about gentrification. I wanted highlights related to anything discussed regarding City Hall processes. It’s super easy to pull reports together for those and anything else. Ultimately, you can use AI to deliver an outline, a strategy map and a very rough draft of a destination master plan. All you need to do is combine all of the above together, plus PDFs of all relevant public and private planning documents, PDFs of all relevant case studies and best practices, and detailed instructions about the purpose, elements, structure, etc., of the plan. People will disagree, sure. I'm not dismissing the expertise of people who put these things together, because they bring deep context to every conversation and decision made during the development of a master plan. Everything happening now in Near Southside has happened somewhere else. When you can bring takeaways from those places to any present situation, it helps provide direction for everyone in the room. Again, I’m not saying that AI is replacing humans. People get all kinds of worked up over that, especially in travel and tourism. I am saying you can create a better, more strategic and more informed master plan in a much more streamlined fashion when you employ AI strategically to better prepare a community for the future. That's just a fact. I have four more community focus groups today in Near Southside. The expectation among everyone is that their contributions will make a demonstrable difference in their neighborhood. We can’t just speak to the challenges. We need to fix them and our processes with AI are giving everyone more confidence that we can deliver on that. Wondering how many DMOs are interested in employing similar AI-first strategies to get a better handle on how to help their communities. Greg Oates

How Visit Richmond is Using AI to Sell More Conventions Aug 2 Written By Greg Oates DMO CEOs want specific use cases for AI showing how they drive measurable business results. Here's a great example for capitalizing on AI to drive meetings and conventions volume from Lauran Peoples , director of sales marketing and business development at Visit Richmond in Virginia. Peoples works in the organization's 13-person sales team and reports to the VP of sales. Her role has three core functions: She is the main liaison between the destination sales and marketing departments; she develops and leads campaign strategy for the sales department; and she works with her colleagues to optimize strategic partnerships. Peoples' role is somewhat unique as a liaison between sales and marketing in that she lives on the sales side, versus marketing. She also stands out in our industry as an emerging voice in AI innovation. If you're going to U.S. Travel's ESTO conference this month in Phoenix, look for her and me working in the show's inaugural AI Playground educational activation. Greg Oates: Can you explain your role at Visit Richmond, specifically in terms of how you bridge the sales and marketing teams? Lauran Peoples: It's becoming more common in DMOs for sales teams to have a marketing liaison, but usually that person is based on the marketing team and is mostly assigned to sales to help with creative. The issue is when that marketing liaison is based on the marketing team, they don't have much exposure to the field and what's happening out of market with your salespeople. Our sales team has 45 trade shows this upcoming fiscal year, so they're traveling almost every week. With my situation in Richmond, they're getting real-time data and downloads about what's happening in each destination, so that gives them more authentic conversations to engage planners. Not having someone assigned to a team like that creates a huge disconnect and leaves opportunity on the table. GO: Tell us a little about your journey with AI. LP: I've been working in hospitality for 20 years. Last year, I heard some younger people on the team talking about ChatGPT. So I was like, okay, I don't know anything about that. I went to PCMA Convening Leaders in January and the opening session was all about AI. I remember sitting there feeling like a dinosaur. Feeling very behind. I realized this is a lot more serious and widespread than I thought, so I left and tasked myself with using ChatGPT once a day. Initially, I couldn't differentiate how it wasn't like Google. I was asking it how many tablespoons are in this or that, kind of thing. Since then, my understanding of AI has progressively increased around more complex and comprehensive capabilities. It has streamlined my productivity, but more importantly, AI has become a thought partner for me to bounce all these ideas and scenarios around that I didn't have before. I think that a lot of people are adopting AI and using it as a communications assistant, or a writing assistant. But the part for me that's really exciting and valuable with AI is analyzing and aggregating data and getting it to show you things that you need help with, like sales. GO: Can you share an example? LP: Sure. I took five datasets: five years of lost business, five years of definite business, and three marketing reports from different campaigns we were running with outside agencies like Sojourn and Digital Edge. Those campaigns give us demographic insights because we were targeting certain areas. I also grabbed our sales deployment sheet, which tells you who has what market. I uploaded all of those into ChatGPT and asked it to identify the top five locations for each of our managers based on their market segments. Some results weren't surprising, but there were a few that popped up like Orlando that we've never traditionally considered. When I asked ChatGPT why Orlando, it showed how the city has a large hobby market. It turns out there are a lot of hobby conventions that meet in Orlando. After I compiled the top five locations for each manager, I asked ChatGPT to give me the top five accounts in each of those locations. Then I asked for unique selling propositions for each of those accounts as to why Richmond would be a perfect fit. Finally, I asked it to rank those five destinations based on probability of success. GO: Have you seen any of this result in new business opportunities? LP: Yes. One location that showed up was Philadelphia. Richmond is four hours from Philadelphia, but like Orlando it hasn't typically been on our radar. However, based on the data from ChatGPT, Philly came up as a recommendation. So we sent one of our sales managers to Philadelphia, and she ended up hosting 18 planners, including some who drove from over an hour away to see her. She got such a great response that I had to jump in and go with her because she couldn't host 18 clients by herself. AI has now informed our sales strategy for Philly, and the region is now part of our dedicated sales strategy. We've allocated funds for that sales manager in Philly to join chapters of organizations like MPI and PCMA. So that's how we know there had to be some accuracy to our approach with AI. GO: How do the sales managers feel about you doing this AI analysis? LP: They appreciate it. It's a balance because most sales managers at DMOs aren't entry level; they've been in hospitality for a long time. This is a new process and a new tool for them. Some have destinations they like to go to over and over because they're successful there. But my role is to support business enablement and sales enablement to help them do what they do better and uncover new business. So how we're using AI provides them with additional actionable research. GO: I think one of the most underrated strategies for AI is developing custom GPTs in ChatGPT to help sales teams develop more customized and effective proposals more quickly. Are you building those at all? LP: Yes, definitely. About a month and a half ago, I programmed a GPT for the sales team called "Prospecting Partner." It's trained on our sales collateral and all our information, so it knows our convention packages and understands our jurisdiction and seven localities. The sales managers have been using it to prospect smarter. I included suggested prompts to go beyond just, "Give me a prospecting email." We can get really specific, like, "Help me re-engage an association planner who just lost grant funding." It also provides strategies specifically related to that, and then you can ask how to execute those strategies. So, for example, we know from reports that finance and insurance is an opportunity market for us. It's a small percentage of our current business but it has the highest average daily rate, which makes it very attractive to our hotel partners. So our salespeople are asking ChatGPT for ways we can develop business in the finance and insurance market, and really dig into that. Ultimately, AI is helping our sales team think bigger, smarter and more strategically. I've asked the sales team if they found this helpful, and, you know, salespeople are not an easy crowd. They said yes across the board. With the ChatGPT Enterprise version, I can't see their exact prompts due to privacy, but I can see the number of conversations they're having with the tool, so I know they're actively using it. GO: How are other people on your team using AI? LP: My two direct reports are our CRM database administrator and our sales coordinator. My sales coordinator does support work for the entire team, so she's using ChatGPT a lot for ideation, like when a sales manager needs an itinerary to entertain clients in Chicago. My CRM database administrator uses ChatGPT as a communication assistant because sometimes analytical personality types can benefit from exploring more communication nuances. She's also started incorporating it into data cleanup, using it to analyze reports and suggest what's missing or what would be beneficial. She uses it to help fill in gaps and identify what's not being asked or said. GO: What are some of your future plans with AI? LP: We're launching microsites for destination sales and sports, and I think it will set a model for the rest of the organization because we’re replacing our website from pre- to post-AI, like most DMO sites these days. We're currently writing copy for the microsites, and I've been getting into structured data and semantic clarity. You don't search ChatGPT or prompt ChatGPT with the same language you search Google, so content has to be written differently. Previously, you'd go to Google and say "restaurants near me." Now with ChatGPT, it's more of a conversation, so you'll say, "Hey, I'm in Scott's Addition historic district in Richmond with my kids, and we're looking for a vegan restaurant." That semantic clarity allows AI to respond with much more specific answers. I think we need to anticipate AI searches, as opposed to Google searches, in how we write content. Everyone is subconsciously expecting a personally curated experience today. When I go on Amazon, I'm expecting it to make connections that I like this, so I might also like this, without me having to tell it certain things. That's where we have to move towards, or we get eclipsed or become obsolete, especially if we're just thinking of ourselves as brokers for a destination. Greg Oates

Visit Phoenix CEO on Leading AI Strategy and Being Chill About It Jul 28 Written By Greg Oates I learned a lot about how DMO leaders can confidently integrate AI processes into their organizations after speaking with Ron Price, CDME, president and CEO of Visit Phoenix. Price is somewhat new to AI but his staff have been doing cool things with various LLMs for a while. He says his primary role with AI is providing the Visit Phoenix team with an enabling environment for success built on a culture of trust. Price accomplishes that by inspiring everyone to experiment with AI, be aware of the liabilities, share their wins, have fun with it, reach out to others for advice, and most of all, validate everything. Although, what stood out for me the most talking with Price is his calm and clear approach to AI, basically inferring (in my words, not his)... "We got this. We might do something amazing today with AI or we might not, but either way we're fully committed to seeing what it can do. We're also going to figure this AI thing out by collaborating with our many DMO industry friends. Because AI is going to change everything in a hurry, and we at Visit Phoenix are not going to be caught staring out at a Sonoran sunset while the world passes our city by." That's the vibe I got. That's leadership. That's what being a CEO means, at least for me. AI is confusing, sure, and CEOs have to worry about their boards and electeds. The thing is, we're more than two and a half years into generative AI now, and it's not going to wait for CEOs to decide if they can "trust AI" or not. I think we can all learn from Price a few things: We can de-escalate all the hubris and hand-wringing surrounding AI by being open to possibilities and having a clear set of principles, especially related to responsible AI use and verification. You can have fun with AI and focus on business outcomes at the same time. The DMO industry needs to collaborate and share best practices more intentionally to accelerate AI education, innovation and integration. We must encourage DMO staff to use AI today so they can steer the future of our industry tomorrow. Price likes talking about AI. I would encourage any DMO CEOs on the fence with AI to reach out to him. Greg Oates: Ron, how do you use AI? Ron Price: I use AI every single day, going back now about a month and a half. I'm just fascinated and interested in what it's able to do. I wouldn't say I'm an early adopter, of course, although there are some people who aren't even on it yet. Me personally, I use it for everything, like if I'm curious about something that's happening within the region. Or maybe I want to quickly compile a lot of data to help solve a problem or answer questions as I get ready for different meetings. More or less, my brain is always just firing, like, "What if we tried this or that?" And so, this year has been a cool realization about what AI can do, and seeing how it's pulling all the sources through to validate what it responds with. We have also integrated AI with Microsoft Copilot. We pay for everyone to have access to that, and then we also have a ChatGPT Team account for our staff. GO: Where else are you seeing value with AI at Visit Phoenix? RP: In our world, it's marketing, it's content. I love being surrounded by people who can write really well. It's an art to me, and I don't possess that art. It's like someone playing the piano. I'm in awe of that. So AI gives people the ability to write better, and it's okay to lean into it. Don't feel threatened by it. AI is able to give you that one golden nugget, or it suggests that one good idea that can really help someone when they're writing. Here's the fun part. Every day, we're learning something unique. We have the Cronkite School of Journalism in Phoenix, and some of the students are here. We kind of give them free rein, and we're also teaching them at the same time. The way that they use AI is amazing. It's fun to walk down the hall to see them because I'm always like, "How did you write that? How did you create that image? How did you pull that data and research together?" It's just a different generation. We're also seeing where our people are asking AI things like, "If I'm a salesperson, how do I influence a group to come here in the middle of the summer for a conference? Why is it fun to be here for a conference when it's 110 degrees out?" And what does AI have to say? Well, one thing that's great about, say, Grok, for example, it's pulling from all these little texts on Twitter, or X. They're from people saying, "Hey, I know it's summertime in Phoenix but look what I got to do." Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use. GO: Does your staff using AI increase your organization's impact in the community? RP: We not only focus on growing tourism in our community, but we're also joined at the hip with economic development. We look at our role as we're here to build a better community through tourism. And so, when you think about utilizing all the data out there, we always ask ourselves, "How could AI help us consolidate that data and crunch the numbers faster to give us a clearer picture of what we think we know?" For example, how much business that comes in through our leads touch our priority sectors? And of those sectors, which ones align extremely well with what we're doing here at Visit Phoenix? Is it semiconductors? Is it bio-med? Is it something that leans into the engineering side because of what ASU and the Department of Defense are doing? We've seen we can go back and look at the data and get a better picture of those things now. Also, as an example, we have a high propensity to book business around the semiconductor space. So we're utilizing these AI tools to quickly do research like, "Give me a list of the top semiconductor conferences that take place around the world." The responses are quicker and the results are better versus doing a traditional Google search. It's able to pull from a lot of different sources, so that's another way we're using AI. “Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use.” GO: How do you define the role of a CEO to guide a DMO forward with AI? RP: Setting up the rules of the game is important. There are areas of liability we have to be aware of about what you can and can't be pulling in. Those are the types of things we needed to figure out, you know, basically, "What is our rule book for using AI?" I like giving people the ability to use AI as they will. I think it works best whenever people know that it's a tool we want them to utilize. And if it can help us at the end of the day tell a better story, be smarter as we go after business, and be smarter with our analytics to help build our marketing strategy stronger, then use it. I try to build a team of leaders so they're CEOs of their own divisions, and I want them to be thought leaders in their areas. Also, I think AI enables us to get to answers quickly, but, and this is important, how do we validate those answers? We're really good at Visit Phoenix when it comes to validating answers, but we're usually doing it by going the long way and understanding how AI responded like it did. We're reading source by source by source, and then we kind of come to our own conclusion. It's like we're not just focused on the punch line of a joke. We can also tell you the structure of the joke. You always have to validate. We get excited about using AI because it just puts us in a new position. I think it's good to have a CEO that supports that, but that support comes from a trust within the organization. I trust that people are going to utilize AI to help make us better. GO: What keeps you up at night regarding AI? RP: My fear is how do we control and ensure that someone isn't producing something negative on our behalf, and then launching it to the world, and using this incredible tool to hurt us? Because there are people that are extremely gullible who believe whatever they're looking at. That's kind of where my brain goes sometimes. It's only because of what I've already seen these tools can do. I think across the DMO industry, we'll have some "ahas," especially when we get together in various forums to exchange ideas. We need to be talking with each other about, "Here are some things that work really well with AI, and here are the headwinds." And then, "These are the things you need to realize could happen with AI, and here are some ways you can mitigate those problems." The more we can learn from others about how they're using AI, the better. I think what you're putting together about AI strategy with all your insights is going to be extremely valuable. GO: Thank you. So, what are you thinking about next with AI? RP: As AI continues to grow, and we've talked about it here internally, what is the value of a website? In fact, we just started our next fiscal year, July 1. Website visits is no longer a key metric that we're going after. As a leader, I like knowing what's three steps ahead. We currently have these tools, but how are they going to change the way we make decisions going forward? At some point, a lot of what we're talking about now is going to be white noise. And what then? It doesn't mean our jobs of promoting a destination change. It means we're going to get so much better at telling our story through so many different avenues. I believe that our reach is actually going to broaden. We're still going to be responsible for promoting our destination and selling our destination, but how we tell the story and how we show the story is going to change as these tools evolve. Back in the day, a lot of us were reading about Moore's Law and how things just keep improving and getting cheaper, especially in technology. Now we're moving into a space where the rate of growth with AI is going to be something we've never seen before. Greg Oates

German Convention Bureau Leader on the Future of AI-Powered Meetings Jul 27 Written By Greg Oates After the global financial crisis ended in 2011, a few cities and nations around the world began promoting themselves to meeting and convention organizers based on their intellectual capital, versus venues and attractions. Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau (GCB), led this strategy in Europe at the time. Around the same year, I was visiting the House of Logistics & Mobility (HOLM) think tank in Frankfurt. The GCB suggested I visit there to better understand this new direction for attracting high-value business events in advanced industries. "The city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," Dr. Stefan Walter told me, who was a professor at HOLM at the time. "So, this [GCB] strategy is about finding the strengths of our strengths, our core competencies, and for Germany, that’s knowledge and infrastructure. It’s also about connecting ideas.” That has been my due north working in the travel industry ever since. This idea that meeting planners and attendees can tap into a deep knowledge base in a host destination, specific to their interests, for me, is intoxicating. The challenge is it takes a ton of work connecting local leaders in specific advanced industries, like aviation in Frankfurt or e-mobility in Stuttgart, with large global organizations in those same industries and convince them to bring their big annual event to Germany. It's also pretty high level. From an attendee standpoint, if I'm in Hamburg and want to learn about HafenCity, the largest urban makeover in Europe, it's not like I can easily access a bunch of people and organizations leading the future of urban development. Which, would be cool, right? AI is helping make that a reality. Germany's national Open Data/Knowledge Graph project is an ambitious AI-powered initiative to build a massive network of industry suppliers, academic organizations and business leaders across the country. Basically, by indexing the visitor industry and intellectual capital supply chain, Germany can connect the brightest minds in Germany with the rest of the world more seamlessly, effectively and equitably. An "interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," if you will. I spoke with Mr. Schultze to learn more about how AI is impacting the meetings and convention industry in Germany. Greg Oates: How is AI evolving across Germany's visitor industry? Specifically, how are your municipal CVBs and other partners thinking about and using AI right now? Matthias Schultze: Like much of the world, things really accelerated for us around two years ago with the rise of tools like ChatGPT. Suddenly, everyone, from corporates to associations, started thinking seriously about AI. We saw an opportunity and created an innovation platform called ebx.lab . It’s a peer-to-peer learning community for event planners, where we partner with scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute to explore how AI might reshape the business events space. From those early sessions, we have published a few white papers and identified a few core insights. AI clearly has potential to personalize experiences, optimize event planning processes, improve engagement and networking, and maybe most exciting, support predictive analytics. That last one, especially, being able to anticipate trends or behaviors based on data, is what feels most transformative to me personally. GO: How is the GCB embracing AI internally? MS: We developed our own internal AI strategy for the German Convention Bureau. We wanted to give both our team and our stakeholders a shared framework, something that outlined where we are today, where we want to go, and how we get there. It’s called "Driven by People, Powered by Data," and that title really reflects our belief that AI is a tool, not a solution in itself. People need to lead the process. The strategy helps us clarify not just what we can do with AI, but also what we can’t or shouldn’t do, at least not yet. It outlines our roadmap and aligns everyone across our organization and membership. GO: Is that strategy available publicly? MS: Yes, though only in German for now. But with the right AI tools, you can translate it quickly. The strategy touches on everything from marketing and communications to event planning, workflow automation, customer personalization, sustainability, and even ethics and compliance. The ethics component is particularly important. As exciting as AI is, we have to keep guardrails in place. Within our organization, we’re working hard to ensure that AI isn’t something siloed or limited to leadership. It needs to be embedded across every level. Everyone in the organization is expected to develop basic AI literacy. We’ve also worked on minimum viable products for things like dashboards and customer-facing chatbots. Some are already in use today. GO: You've always been a strong and vocal proponent for sustainability in business events. How is AI supporting you there? MS: I’m very proud of a project we developed with 29 other European countries: the Sustainability Hub for Events . It’s an AI-driven platform that brings together all kinds of sustainability related data—certifications, guidelines, best practices—and makes them accessible through an interactive AI agent. Planners can ask things like, “Can you help me build a sustainable menu?” or input event details to estimate their CO₂ footprint. It’s highly practical, and it’s making a real difference for event planners who need fast, reliable and actionable sustainability information. GO: We've talked about your Open Data and Knowledge Graph project in Germany numerous times in the past. Is that now live? MS: It’s technically live but still in progress, and probably always will be, in a sense. We’re continuously expanding it. The Open Data Germany project by the German National Tourist Board is live with its Knowledge Graph. The Open Data MICE project, which is implemented in close cooperation with the GNTB, is not yet live. One exciting element launching soon is an interactive map of research institutions in Germany. It will show where key research and innovation is taking place, including medical tech, renewable energy and so on, and link that data to infrastructure like hotels and conference venues. The idea is to visualize Germany as a knowledge landscape. If you’re planning an event and you want to anchor it around a theme like urban mobility, the map will show you which regions are most active in that field and match you with the relevant venues and experts. GO: One theme I keep obsessing about, and it's felt like a bit of a fantasy for more than a decade, is that the city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine. That idea is a direct quote from your House of Logistics and Mobility in Frankfurt, and it’s stuck with me ever since I heard it back in 2011. It's this idea of a city as a platform. Do you think we're getting closer to executing on this idea, where innovation at all levels is more accessible and shareable for more people? Ultimately what we're talking about here is the democratization of knowledge and excellence. MS: I love that idea. I really do. I think there are two layers to it. On one level, we have the smart city movement with systems that integrate transportation, energy, data and infrastructure to make better decisions. That’s already happening in many places across Europe. But on a deeper level, regarding your fantasy.... Let's say you could land in Munich, be interested in urban tech, and immediately connect with people, events and institutions aligned with that interest—that’s becoming possible too. The data already exists. It’s just scattered. But with open data standards, machine readability, and the right AI tools, we can start connecting those dots. Your fantasy city may not be so far off.

A CEO's Playbook for AI Integration Oct 10 Written By Greg Oates Your competitors are talking about AI. Your board is asking about AI. Your partners want to see your AI strategy. Many DMOs are debating the potential of AI, while an increasing number of others are already extracting real business and organizational value. The difference isn't budget or technical talent. It's knowing exactly where to look for opportunities and how to scale what works. 3 Non-Negotiables You Must Lead This, Not Delegate It: AI transformation dies in committee. The organizations seeing real results have CEOs who champion specific initiatives, remove bureaucratic friction, and signal that AI adoption is a strategic priority. This doesn't mean micromanaging prompts. It means creating air cover for teams to experiment and fail fast. Complex Impresses, Simple Delivers: Your instinct will be to pursue the flashy, sophisticated AI applications that sound impressive in board presentations. Resist it. The organizations generating real ROI start with mundane problems: expense report processing, meeting summarization, competitive monitoring, etc. These boring use cases build organizational confidence and create the foundation for more ambitious projects. Your People Know Where the Problems Are: The best AI applications emerge from the intersection of daily frustration and technological possibility. Run hackathons. Create cross-functional workshops. Ask your teams what they do that feels like waste. The solutions they surface will be more practical and impactful than anything your consultants recommend. Start Here Stop looking for AI opportunities everywhere. Focus your organization's attention on three specific areas where AI creates immediate, measurable value. The Tedium Tax: Every role in your organization includes mind-numbing tasks that consume time without creating value: data entry, compliance documentation, procurement reports, staff vacation tracking, etc. Think of these as your "Anti To-Do List." These are tasks systematically eliminated by asking, "How can I never have to do this again?" Your teams are paying a tedium tax every day. AI is the refund. The Expertise Bottleneck: Projects stall when teams hit the limits of their skills and wait for other departments. Marketing needs data analysis and campaign design mockups. Finance and HR need custom GPTs. Sales needs meetings-related technical specifications translated into customer language. AI breaks these bottlenecks by giving every team superpowers they never had before. The Blank Page Problem: Knowledge work involves ambiguous challenges where the path forward isn't clear: Strategy development, market analysis, problem diagnosis, etc. AI excels at generating multiple approaches, analyzing incomplete information, and proposing next steps when your teams are stuck. It's the thinking partner that's always available and never runs out of ideas. 6 Use Cases OpenAI's analysis of 600+ successful implementations across various industries reveals that virtually every valuable AI application falls into one of six categories. Show your teams these six use cases and they'll start finding opportunities everywhere. Content Creation: Use AI for first drafts of everything: strategy documents, marketing campaigns, product and experience descriptions, customer and community communications. AI maintains your brand voice while eliminating the blank page problem. Research and Synthesis: AI powers information gathering at superhuman speed, including market analysis, competitive intelligence, customer feedback synthesis, regulatory research, etc.. AI doesn't just find information. It structures it exactly how you need it for decision-making. Coding for Everyone: Your non-technical teams can now write Python scripts, SQL queries, and data visualizations. Your engineering teams debug faster and prototype in unfamiliar languages. AI democratizes technical capability while accelerating your experts. Data Analysis Without Degrees: Upload spreadsheets, dashboard screenshots or raw data files and get structured analysis without requiring PhD-level statistics knowledge. This is arguably the most undervalued opportunity that delivers immediate results for most DMOs. Strategic Thinking Partner: AI is a beast for brainstorming, scenario planning, product and event development, asset mapping, risk analysis, etc. AI helps structure complex problems and identifies considerations your teams might miss. This is my favorite use case for AI. Intelligent Automation: Use platforms like n8n, Relay and others to create repeatable processes that run themselves, such as weekly competitive updates, financial reporting, sales and marketing workflows, a ton of admin duties, etc. Create the process once, then let AI handle the execution while humans focus on exceptions and strategy. Implementation is Where DMOs Fail Most AI initiatives fail because organizations treat them like traditional software deployments. They're not. AI is about change management and behavioral transformation up and down the org chart. AI implementation requires different approaches to discovery, prioritization and scaling. Systematic Opportunity Hunting: Don't wait for AI use cases to emerge organically. Run structured discovery sessions where teams audit their workflows for repetitive tasks, skill bottlenecks, and ambiguous challenges. Make this process ongoing, not a one-time exercise. The Impact-Effort Matrix: Not every AI opportunity deserves attention. Prioritize based on business impact versus implementation effort. Quick wins build momentum. High-value, high-effort projects become strategic investments. Everything else gets parked until technology makes it easier. Innovation as Culture: Internal competitions accelerate discovery while building AI literacy across your organization. The goal isn't technical sophistication. It's practical business solutions that teams actually want to use. Measure What Matters: Track time saved, accuracy improved, costs reduced and capability expansion. But also measure qualitative impacts: employee satisfaction, process improvements, competitive advantages. Use this data to guide scaling decisions. Build Your AI Process Move beyond random experimentation to systematic capability building. I like Estée Lauder's 5-phase process to ensure repeatable success with AI. Does this resonate with you for your DMO? Design: Define your purpose, scope and success criteria for AI integration in a 2-page brief. No scope creep. No technical complexity for its own sake. Prepare: Ask department heads to gather relevant data and best practices. AI tools should reflect organizational knowledge, not generic approaches. Build and Test: Hire contractors where necessary to help teams develop automations/agents, implement training, integrate datasets and validate accuracy. Focus on usability, not just functionality. Launch: Deploy with user guides and change management support. Technology deployment is easy. User adoption across all departments is a total headache at first. Optimize: Feedback loops drive continuous improvement based on actual usage patterns. AI applications evolve with business needs and improved capabilities. Key Insight: Always start with fundamental questions: Why build this? What problem does it solve? What impact will it have? Is the measurement for success quantitative or qualitative? Organizations that answer these questions clearly will build more successful AI applications than those focused primarily on technical capability. Build AI-Native Workflows The most sophisticated implementations integrate AI across entire business processes rather than individual tasks. This evolution positions organizations for the agentic AI capabilities coming next. Process Decomposition: Break complex workflows into constituent tasks, identify where each AI use case category adds value, and create integrated approaches spanning from research through execution. Marketing workflows might integrate research for market understanding, analysis for opportunity mapping, ideation for strategy, content creation for product and destination development, and automation for distribution. Cross-Functional Integration: AI facilitates better collaboration by translating between departments. Technical specifications become marketing language. Customer requirements inform sales priorities. Financial models drive strategic planning. Future-Proofing for Agents: Current workflow integration prepares your organization for AI agents that can complete entire projects independently. Teams that understand how to break processes into AI-addressable components will leverage these capabilities immediately when available. The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done. This cognitive shift creates advantages that compound over time and become increasingly difficult for competitors to replicate. "The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done." Key Takeaways The question isn't whether AI will transform our industry. It's whether you'll be leading that transformation or reacting to it. Start with clear, achievable use cases and systemic approaches to build the organizational muscle needed for transformation. AI advantage isn't about having the most technical teams or biggest budgets. It's about developing capabilities for organization-wide discovery, adoption, implementation and scaling of practical business solutions. The organizations moving beyond experimentation to systematic implementation today will be best positioned to leverage the more sophisticated AI capabilities emerging tomorrow. The agents are coming. Will you be ready? Greg Oates

The ROI of AI Agents Aug 21 Written By Greg Oates Based on a bunch of conversations at DI Annual 2025 this month, it's clear that many DMO executives still equate generative AI primarily with writing and editing in ChatGPT. But as one COO of a large U.S. DMO told me, "Surely there's more to all this than just learning about prompting." So many ways to respond to that. Meanwhile, there are also DMO leaders who established AI road maps for their organizations going back two years. For them, they're increasingly focused on developing AI-powered automated workflows and their more sophisticated cousins, AI agents. The purpose of these synthetic workflows is to automate tedious, time-consuming and repetitive tasks to free up staff to focus on more high-value work. Think of it as an evolution from using AI to building AI. You begin by visually mapping what people do in your organization. Then you identify where AI can potentially take over all the mundane stuff better and faster. I’ve been working with my colleagues at Matador Network to develop automated workflows for our Studio team. We have endless terabytes of client video created during the last 10 years. Now, with AI, we want to capitalize on those existing assets to create new video, but first we need to use AI to understand what we actually own. We contracted Erick Bonilla , founder of Pocho.tech based in Uruguay, to build a series of new AI workflows in n8n. One of the automations is designed to cull through 10 years of video files in Dropbox and catalogue everything in Airtable. The AI then creates standardized file names, project IDs, links for raw edited videos and finished client hero/cutdown videos, and location and content tags. The cost to develop the AI workflow was about $2,000 all-in, and it saved more than a month of work at a mid-level manager salary. The beauty of automations/agents is you can measure ROI annually fairly easily, which will help wake up your board if they're sleeping on AI. Moreover, once an automation is in place, the savings will continue to accrue in the future indefinitely for tasks still required, and there’s zero human error. During a staff Zoom, I asked members of our Studio team if they felt these new agents signaled to them the beginning of the end of some people’s jobs. The response was unanimous. Nobody wants to do this type of repetitive grunt work. I spoke with Bonilla for his take on the future of AI agents. Greg Oates: Erick, what services does Pocho.tech provide? Erick Bonilla: We identify opportunities within organizations of all sizes, where we believe implementing AI systems can dramatically improve the efficiency of operations. We can create workflows that process data, or we can create AI agents capable of reasoning, analyzing data, creating reports, and providing decision-makers with an enhanced way of digesting information. I have been doing this for almost two years, working with people mostly in the Middle East, the US and Latin America. The Pocha company site is brand new as I try to expand in the world of AI. GO: What’s the difference between automated workflows and agents? EB: A workflow is like a mass production factory. It's a set of operations that work through specific logic to automate a repetitive process that a human has done before. This could be writing and reading emails, writing summaries, reformatting and transferring content through different tools and applications, etc. An AI agent is a thinking environment that makes decisions for you. You can set a workflow for reading your emails. But then you can have an AI agent that summarizes your emails and tells you, if you have 10 emails, what those 10 emails are about in just one email, SMS text, WhatsApp message, Google doc or whatever. GO: So an AI agent has more autonomy and decision-making capabilities than an automated workflow? EB: Definitely. The AI agent is capable of being completely autonomous to make decisions within a given context. You give it a context with defined restrictions that narrows the scope of the decisions it can make. GO: Can you provide any success stories where you worked with a client who had a specific challenge, and you created an automated workflow or agent that successfully delivered a solution? EB: The most recent example is an EdTech company in Boston that provides a training and placement program for clean energy jobs. They've been operating for the past five years, but there’s been a lack of funds, employees and program applicants to scale beyond Massachusetts. So they decided to use AI and automation to build flows without having to invest a lot of money in hiring people. What I did was streamline the application process for people interested in entering the educational program. We created a form and a workflow that takes the information from the application and puts it into an application tracking system. This system has workflows that can trigger emails, daily reports, weekly reports and invitations to interview. Then I created an AI agent. Once the applicants are interviewed by a human, we take the transcript of that, analyze it using AI, and build a report for the decision maker so they can decide if this person is capable of entering the program or not. We also created a scoring system. We built it based on human criteria, which is subjective, and then we converted that into an objective dataset so we could classify people and score them based on numbers. All of this is done by an AI agent that sets a score for the applicant at the end of the interview. Then we have a leaderboard where people are ranked, and the top 15 get into the education program and placement process. GO: Were they happy with the end result? EB: Oh yeah, very happy. Here's where the beauty and magic come in. Now the CEO can envision a way of expanding outside Massachusetts, and tell her team, "Hey, we're going to New York!" Where before, she thought she needed to hire more people in each new state to oversee the operation. And, because an AI agent works 24/7, she doesn't have to wait until 8am to get a report or transcription, or anything anymore. So now, she can think about how to scale her company more successfully without having to hire more people. GO: What's the road map looking ahead? Where are you going with the company in terms of next steps? EB: We're trying to create an outreach system because the purpose of the company is not only to train people but also to place them in clean tech job positions. The outreach system is going to help the team find more companies with open positions, so the company can place more people in those positions. We’re building a system involving AI agents and workflows where we're going to take a picture of all the open positions and analyze and understand them using AI. We want to know, what are the requirements in terms of learning and knowledge capacity for people to get in these positions, so the company can build a better training program. GO: What was the biggest challenge working with them? EB: I think the most important one, and this is something anyone working on this will experience, is the resistance of some team members who don't trust the performance of AI enough. People who have low experience working with AI, and maybe only know ChatGPT, will look at this and say, "I don't believe this can work." So that means there’s a lot of educational work. People need enough knowledge about what AI tools are capable of to suggest what can and can’t work. I think that's the main challenge. But once people see it working, they start to lean into AI. Suddenly, they become like, "This is great. Can you add this other metric? Can you make it do this other thing too? Can you make me one for my personal side hustle?" It's interesting when you see people moving from resistance to acceptance. GO: Working with you has firmly cemented something I've been preoccupied with this year. It's this: One of the most exciting things about AI, which is giving us more time back during the day, requires the most boring thing, which is having uniform file and data structure. As we've discovered together only too well, AI can't reach its full potential unless you have everything structured super cleanly. The analogy I often use is that AI is like an 8-year-old savant. The person is brilliant but he or she often needs really consistent environments and clear guardrails, or things go sideways or just crash. Can you talk about what any organization needs to focus on when it comes to file and data structure? EB: I think one of the most basic things, and I'm living this with a company I'm helping right now, is documenting files and folders exactly the same. You must set protocols for everything when you’re building a folder system to store content and data. That's one of the biggest challenges for companies trying to implement AI automation with poorly standardized systems. When we didn’t have AI a few years ago, we didn't think of a machine reading our documents or files. We never thought that could be possible, so we never really focused on creating really good file structure. The biggest challenge for companies, coming back to Matador, is how to organize the field of play so that AI doesn't struggle. We easily lose the excitement of implementing AI in an organization when an AI is trying to navigate a maze of poorly organized files. For that, you need to build SOPs that tell everyone on the team, “We're going to be naming files this way now so that a 5-year-old can read the titles and understand what's in every one of them. Because if a 5-year-old can read this set of folders and understand what's inside all of them, then AI can do that too. And if AI can find and read everything, then AI can do some truly amazing things and save companies a lot of money. GO: So how are organizations like ours, which have been in operation for a long time, supposed to go back decades and reorganize all our files? EB: We can run a workflow that can do that for you. That's where the ROI comes in. You can make a one-time investment building a workflow that's going to completely standardize all your filing and foldering. But if you do that, you have to know that the ROI might not show up right away. It's going to start paying off later in terms of the time, money, stress and everything it’s going to give back. A CEO must understand that the return on that investment is going to be ongoing through the years, not in the next quarter necessarily. If you have that mentality, then your company is going to become AI-first. GO: You’ve told me before that AI is not a tool, it's a culture. Can you explain that? EB: Right now, the biggest obstacle for AI expanding in many companies are the CEOs. I understand the challenges because they fear a lot of reputational risk. You have a board and customers that are going to be judging you. If you don't have a very good AI road map, then it could turn into a failure, and the fingers are going to be pointing at you. I understand that completely. But AI should be a culture within companies, and that starts top down because the CEO has to embrace trial and error. AI is going to fail at least during the first time you start with any automation. It's like when you're building a prompt. We were talking the other day, and you said using AI is not about writing the perfect first prompt. It's that fifth or sixth prompt that's going to get you to the right answer. You're going to be iterating with automation, too. That's something CEOs have to transmit throughout the organization. GO: I think for many tourism organizations, we haven’t even begun talking about the big picture value of AI. From an internal perspective, for example, agents offer a whole new level for optimizing operations with AI. EB: Yes, exactly. When we're in a company and we're facing challenges, the first intuitive thinking is, "How can I solve this? I'm going to Google it.” Now we're transitioning to, "How can I solve this? I'm going to ask ChatGPT.” This is great, but that's not AI-first. That's changing one tool for another. You're still browsing. It's literally the same thing. You're not really using AI. AI-first means, "I do this thing that's consuming 10 hours a week. I do the same thing every time. I spend two hours every day doing the same four steps. How can I use AI to automate this?" That's AI-first because you're using AI to stop wasting time. I think that's the culture we should be striving for. If a CEO injects the whole company with that mindset, then the employees are going to eventually use AI to solve their issues more independently and autonomously. At the end of the day, what AI really does is gives us more time and more of our lives back, and we have not yet understood that because it's new. But it's true, AI is the way for humans to have more life. GO: I want that. EB: We all do. GO: I have this belief that eventually, in any organization, all meetings will be recorded and deposited into a central knowledge base where an AI can summarize everything and connect all the key takeaways. I might have a meeting and someone on the other side of the world has a meeting, and the AI will know we're talking about the same thing. It will see and surface how there's potential opportunity to connect our efforts. It's like one plus one equals three, or more. Do you think that's where we're going and that it will benefit companies? EB: Definitely. It's the most common sense thing to do, but I know it's also counterintuitive because there are many people who would not like to have all conversations recorded. The fidelity, the accuracy of the information, and it all being in one place and uniformly structured, is everything. You can have thousands of conversations and tell the AI, "Go here and search for this specific idea in all the transcripts where we have talked about that." You just need to build the SOPs. Then a human can quality control it and say, "This is right. This isn't right. Maybe we can tweak this, or build on that." GO: I’ve experienced this firsthand where people are vehemently against this idea of all company meetings being recorded. For many it portends that clichéd dystopic future we see in science fiction, where everything's controlled and you have no freedom, right? EB: I can see it too. We must remember that these tools can be turned off. If we let the technology control us, then that's on us. I think at the end of the day, it's about how do you balance the risk and rewards? This is something CEOs are used to. Do you prefer to live in blindness and have an uncompetitive company because you decided not to take that risk with automation? Or do you take the risk and have everything recorded, even though some people are going to say it’s Orwellian in a way, and even though ultimately it's going to improve everybody's life? We have to find that balance, and that’s the CEO’s role to determine what’s best overall for the company, customers and employees in the future. GO: Any last thoughts? EB: I think we are not quite there yet to know for sure the amount of ROI that is going to come from agents and automations. Definitely it is going to be positive ROI. For that, I'm completely sure. What I'm not sure is how do we measure ROI based on the anticipated lifetime value of the process? So much is changing so quickly and it's difficult to see the future. As the tools get better, then the workflow gets better too, so the ROI increases, right? Except, we don't really have models for that. For CEOs, I think, they have to try to envision how they can measure the value of automations now, and how that might evolve exponentially in the future. Greg Oates

What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates CEOs at destination marketing and management organizations (DMOs) are seeking AI guidance specifically tailored to their chief executive roles. A CEO in the U.S. told me recently that current AI education is often too surface level, vague, unstructured, or trying to cover too much ground to be useful for a chief executive. He said, "We've been talking for a while now about how we need AI education targeting leadership, but it doesn't really exist." While destination leaders face many more questions about AI than answers, one thing is 100% clear: CEOs must own and lead their organizations' AI integration across all departments. AI isn't something to outsource or delegate to others, and it's not a "marketing thing" for the CMO to figure out. Conor Grennan , chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, consults with clients on AI strategy from JPMorgan to NASA. I asked him how important it is for CEOs to lead AI education, adoption and integration across their organizations. “CEOs have to understand how to use AI and why; they really have to have felt the delight about what AI can do,” he said. "They also have to see clearly how AI is a leadership and change management challenge, not a tech challenge. Then they need to start out being vulnerable, and be able to say, ‘Hey, I was skeptical about AI. I didn’t understand it, either. But now I can explain the way I learned it and how to communicate why it’s important to help other people understand it.” So why do CEOs need to understand AI? Jeff Bezos answered that at The New York Times DealBook Summit last year. He described how “modern AI is a horizontal enabling layer" that will soon be integrated into every device and digital application in existence. "These kind of horizontal layers like electricity and compute and now artificial intelligence, they go everywhere," he said. "I guarantee you there is not a single application that you can think of that is not going to be made better by AI." Here's the clip: Strategic AI Approaches I met with about a dozen CEOs in North America to find out what they want to know about AI specifically from a CEO perspective. Some leaders are seeking big-picture guidance with a broad overview of high-level strategy. "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” one CEO told me. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" Another chief executive said, “We see three areas of opportunity for AI: Administrative tasks and general productivity; marketing chat, SEO and data readiness; and helping customers find information about our city more effectively.… The two most important things I want to know are how to develop AI policy and how is AI changing SEO." A year ago, most CEOs had a wait-and-see attitude about AI, following how the technology evolved and what their cohorts in other organizations were doing. Today, there is a general consensus among CEOs that they need to invest in AI, but the question is how and where. One CEO told me he knows he needs to integrate AI tools and processes into his DMO, but he has three overarching questions that he wants answered first, at least at a high level: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” Other CEOs are seeking clarity on the basic fundamentals of AI: "I need to understand what are the problems that we're trying to solve with AI. What is the purpose of a chatbot, for example? What am I buying, and what can we as an organization accomplish with it?" And then others just want immediate actionable solutions: "I'm not interested in hypotheticals. Show me five ways I can implement AI on Monday. Give me turnkey AI solutions that work today." AI Data is King Personalized data is one of generative AI’s biggest value propositions. Conversational AI (chat) is the new marketplace, and it’s eating the entire funnel including in-destination engagement. In some cities, AI chat conversations between DMOs and visitors is exceeding 25% in-destination, giving DMOs a way to influence visitor behavior in real time. Also, in some industry segments like tours and activities, in-chat conversations are driving in-destination bookings with partners like GetYourGuide. Everyone is looking for first/zero-party data around that. “We have a low level of proprietary data about who is in our destination and what they’re doing,” asserted one CEO. “We have a few disparate data sources, but we need to connect those, and we want to be able to use it predictively. For example, we're looking at regression analysis to help develop future scenario modeling, and we're looking at AI to help us with that." Another CEO said, “We need data that provides material value for our partners. That’s our mandate. How are our visitors spending money and where? How are they behaving and traveling through our area? How can we help people find our partners in a more personalized way?” And one CEO added, "A key priority for us is figuring out the data equation so outbound messaging can be tailored to a 1-on-1 relationship.” Striving for that direct individual customer engagement has been the holy grail for marketers for decades. The ability to deliver mass personalization at scale is now coming into focus with enhanced AI data curation. National organizations like Destination Canada and Germany Travel have invested millions of dollars in data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to restructure their tourism product data from scratch, capitalize on the data more effectively to rank higher in AI search, and drive incremental revenue to partners. That's what the future looks like. For more information, check out the new Canadian Tourism Data Collective and Germany's Open Data Project . Today, local tourism organizations are starting to see how data structure and content architecture are strategic imperatives for them, too. One municipal CEO explained, "I think it might almost be too early to have this conversation in some areas until AI matures more. One thing I am eager to know now is how do we develop a data lake to structure our own data and messaging to make it easier for AI search tools to find." AI search and SEO are a huge conversation today. During the past year, the #1 question I heard while speaking about AI with dozens of North American destination organizations, their boards and key industry/community stakeholders, was: How do we rank higher in AI search? What happens when AI buries organic content? What’s going to happen to our websites? Are they going to disappear? Is a DMO without a website still a DMO? How do we need to produce content differently? And, what the heck is a data lake? One CEO I spoke with is planning on developing a new website for her organization. She said, "I don't even know what I don't know about AI search, but we need to figure some of that out before we start spending any money." Along with data, defining KPIs for AI integration is a hot topic of debate, and presently there isn’t a complete and codified list of metrics that DMO leaders agree on. That said, perhaps the travel and tourism industry collectively needs to understand what AI is, and what it can accomplish at scale, before attaching too many metrics to it. A CMO told me at DI MarCom Summit this month, “People didn’t ask about ROI with the internet when it first came around. We just knew we had to have it,” because it was a new channel for reaching visitors. Same as AI now. Expanding on that, he suggested that DMOs need to break AI success tracking into awareness metrics and performance metrics, and get that conversation right before anything else. Staff AI Adoption Unlike previous technology evolutions, there doesn’t seem to be as much of a generational divide between early adopters of AI and everyone else. The industry can’t look to Gen Z for guidance about how to use AI to the same degree we once asked Millennials for insights about Instagram. Again, driving AI adoption across an organization begins with the CEO. Once that’s established, the real challenge is convincing department leaders and staff to lean into AI. It's a challenge because there is widespread concern, skepticism and/or suspicion among many staff members across many industries that they’re being asked to learn new technologies that will eventually replace them. Leadership should say to employees that no one can force them to use AI, but the job market will. The data is clear. According to the Linkedin/Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index : 79% of leaders agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with Al skills than a more experienced one without 66% of leaders won’t hire someone without AI skills 60% of leaders worry their organization lacks a plan and vision to implement AI And that's a year old. But, understandably, emphasizing those numbers comes across as threatening. A better strategy for driving AI adoption is finding staff members who are already seeing success with AI, supporting them with access to education and pro AI models, and working out from there. The more employees see their colleagues using AI, the more some of them feel inclined to lean in. Therefore, every DMO needs a comprehensive strategic AI road map that includes purpose, policy, education, integration and a continuous feedback loop across all levels of staff. CEOs need to create a space for that. "We're giving our staff time to play around with AI, but they have to present what they're focusing on and what they're learning to their individual supervisor," a CEO told me. Another added, “We're focusing on staff adoption. But I need you to explain to me what works, how to implement, and what should I watch out for." I'm presently working with our departments at Matador Network to explore a bunch of various AI models to optimize workflows, boost creativity, enhance strategic planning, diversify product, etc. There's a well-communicated mandate from the top that Matador will become an AI-first company, and sooner than later. To help accelerate that, we created an AI task force to bring more perspectives from across the company together to integrate AI into operations. That has been valuable with some immediate takeaways, such as staff is now reaching out and asking for assistance with AI. But it's only a start. "There's this idea that if you can get a core group of people using AI then their attitudes and behaviors will spread organically throughout the rest of the company," said Conor Grennan at NYU. "It doesn't work that way. You have to find the people who have fears about AI and listen to them to understand why. You have to say, 'Yes, AI does suck at that, but here's what it's good at.' You also need to weed out the negative people who are against AI outright. They're dangerous." 5 Key Takeaways Let's go back to that first CEO who wants to know the five big questions about AI. Based on the input from the above CEOs, here's a first stab at that: How can I create AI policy that serves our organization but doesn't suppress experimentation among staff? (Interestingly, policy did not come up that much with the CEOs I spoke with.) How do we need to develop our websites, content and data to rank higher in AI search? How is AI SEO different, and the same, as old SEO? What are existing AI chat platforms accomplishing, how are visitors using them, and how are they influencing travel decision making and purchase behavior? If AI is not just for marketing, what does the ecosystem of AI tools for all departments look like across the organization? And what do they do in terms of increasing productivity, creativity and quality? How do I get staff to buy in? We know AI is an imperative for our organization's competitive advantage and relevance. And we know AI is an imperative for employees for their professional growth and marketability. But how do we get our people to really believe in the need to embrace AI? Greg Oates

Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Royce Chwin, president and CEO of Destination Vancouver , personifies how a DMO chief executive needs to establish and articulate the mandate for integrating AI across the organization. That was the topic of our last Destination AI post where 12 CEOs explained: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . Early in 2024, Chwin addressed the full staff in Destination Vancouver’s office before a session I was presenting there on AI. “We cannot not do this,” he said, stating that the organization needed to adopt AI processes to stay relevant in the industry and increase its value in the community. If Destination Vancouver is positioning itself as an innovative DMO, he explained, then the road ahead with AI was clear. Since then, Destination Vancouver launched a new website fully integrated with AI where visitors can customize how they find travel information. The build was a two-year process requiring an inordinate amount of learning to capitalize on generative AI. The team also developed an AI policy guide that Chwin shared for this post. The comprehensive document is designed to "provide clear protocols that maximize and encourage the use of Al tools where appropriate and safe to do so, while minimizing any potential risks and concerns." The policy guide encourages staff to use AI for "enhancing productivity, efficiency, creativity or decision-making." It defines when not to use AI models and how staff is required to review and validate all AI outputs for accuracy and bias. Also, Stefan Hawes, vp of global marketing, initiated the development of an internal AI Council, bringing together a diverse group of staff to coordinate AI processes across the organization. Chwin shared an internal briefing report outlining the purpose of the Council as follows: It is recommended that an AI Council be established immediately to provide a centralized body for managing AI-related initiatives and to expand training opportunities for team members. The Council will focus on: Setting strategic priorities related to AI Selecting use cases, implementing projects/initiatives/AI software purchases and evaluating their effectiveness Developing a data strategy to support AI adoption and initiatives Developing an AI education, literacy and adoption program Ensuring ethical compliance Fostering cross-departmental collaboration to maximize the impact of AI projects We created a similar AI task force at Matador, and the value of that cannot be overstated to better assess how staff from different departments perceive, and misperceive, AI in general. I talked with Chwin this week to better understand how a DMO CEO can best lead strategic AI implementation across his or her organization. The purpose of this post is to help inform, inspire and influence other CEOs to consider the opportunities of AI in a new light. Greg Oates: Royce, you've been a strident proponent of AI for a couple years now, and yet there are many other CEOs who are still reticent. How did you personally come to decide Destination Vancouver needed to embrace AI? Royce Chwin: The perception still of some DMOs is that we are behind when it comes to technology. We're slow to adapt. We're slow to evolve. You see all these other organizations in the travel sphere around us that are able to move much quicker. They might be capitalized better. They can adjust. They can pivot quicker to take on these new technologies, and they can experiment seemingly without the degree of fear or consternation that maybe some DMOs have. So, I think there's lots of different reasons. For us, I mean, it's day and night. We can't not do that. Our entire ecosystem that we play in has some level of AI being used. Number one is our customers. They’re using AI. So it goes back to that same idea that you and I have discussed many times before: How do we as a DMO stay relevant and how do we show value? AI is a response to answering those two things. GO: In many organizations today, there’s often skepticism and suspicion among staff about how AI might take their jobs, or they’re dismissive of AI altogether. How does your team feel about AI overall? RC: I'm not finding a fear in our organization for using AI. I think it's a different set of challenges. I think there are so many derivatives of AI out there that people don't know what to focus on. Because you can’t and don't need to focus on 40 different AI tools. The question is, what are the best tools that are most relevant to the work that I need to do? That, I think, in my experience is a bigger challenge. My sense of it is that AI can be so overwhelming. It can seem unbelievably complicated. So we had to ask ourselves, do we have the time, resources and skill sets to simply understand it? Secondly, are we asking better questions to understand what in the organization we need to solve, and can AI help? GO: In a previous post, I shared input from 12 DMO CEOs about how they feel about AI. What are you hearing from other CEOs? RC: I was over in Europe recently for Destinations International’s Global Leaders Forum where I was onstage with Sherrif Karamat (CEO of PCMA) and Petra Stušek (CEO at Ljubljana Tourism). We were talking about the importance of face-to-face meetings and so on, and Sherrif made a comment that DMOs are really behind using AI. It was kind of a blanket statement, and he's not wrong. But, I said to Sheriff that I think a lot of DMOs are behind because it's like throwing confetti in somebody's face and asking them to pick the best pieces. They don't even know what they're trying to evaluate, and it’s also moving so fast. In the meantime, our customers are running around us using AI for all kinds of things. And so I think that there's not so much a fear of using AI. It’s more that people are questioning how to respond to the increasing emergence of AI because they’re thinking, “I'm not really 100% clear on the business problem I'm trying to solve that supports my mandate.” For us, and you saw it when you visited, we were really clear on what it is that we needed to do. We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI. “We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI.” GO: I’ve been asserting that CEOs should own and lead AI adoption in their organizations to have the best chance for success. I don't mean lead it day to day. I mean the chief executive must establish the mandate that AI is something the organization is going to invest in, and articulate why and how to the entire staff. Connor Grennan, chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, emphasized to me that’s the only way this works. Do you agree? RC: Yes, I absolutely believe it must come from the CEO because the CEO has to clear the vision with the team. And with something as seismic as AI, and how it’s evolving in our daily life, in our world, I think the CEO has a responsibility to address it and how it will impact the organization. Everyone needs to understand how we’re going to use AI in alignment with our mission and strategic goals, and how it will support the mandate. That's all CEO level. That's the responsibility on my head. Also, I can't imagine going in front of my Board and asking, “Hey, what are you doing with AI? What should we do with AI?” So it has to come from the CEO, but my Board has also enabled me. Like, there's no grief from my Board. Zero. We are fully enabled. GO: You've created the necessary structure to help govern AI integration with your AI Policy and AI Council. Can you expand on the thinking behind those? RC: We developed an AI policy that’s designed to enable people to use AI and not discourage them from experimenting. Obviously, some education is required in terms of proprietary information and those kinds of things. But we're really leaning into this and we're going to assign some time for it to enable the organization to experiment and play with AI without fear of reprisal. Naturally there needs to be governance around it, but governance does not mean stopping creativity. Governance means we’re creating and delivering new opportunities for creativity. There just needs to be structure around that. Also, Stefan came up with the idea of pulling together an AI Council in the organization, which I think is fantastic. We're getting individuals from each business line, including myself, and we’re going to talk about AI, its impacts, what we need to be thinking about, and how we'll improve our website and the organization as a whole. So we're creating dialogue around it to define opportunities. For example, I'm really excited about AI as it relates to all the country market analysis that we do. We've been doing that by spreadsheet, but now we’re exploring AI to provide the insights we need to inform our market planning more effectively. There are lots of different examples like that, but you only discover them by being open to experimenting with AI. Greg Oates

Toronto & Denver Tourism Leaders on the 5 Big AI Questions for CEOs Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates A year from now, the travel and tourism sector might look back and thank Andrew Weir, president and CEO of Destination Toronto , for catalyzing how DMOs move forward with AI. At PCMA Convening Leaders in January this year, I asked Weir what CEOs need to understand about AI at a high level. Numerous other CEOs have told me there’s a complete lack of AI education specifically designed for DMO chief executives. His answer was first shared anonymously in our previous post, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” said Weir. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" At the end of that post I suggested what those five questions might be based on all the CEO insights in there, and I've since been shopping them around to vet them. A few weeks ago, for example, Richard Scharf, president and CEO at Visit Denver , suggested restructuring the questions to create a more logical hierarchy. Now, the first three deal with internal operations while the last two identify external, visitor-facing priorities. Yesterday, I spoke again with Weir, as well as Paula Port, vice president of marketing at Destination Toronto, for their input on the five questions. The goal here is to provide clear structure around AI platforms and processes for DMOs leading up to Matador Network’s collaboration with U.S. Travel at ESTO in Phoenix this fall. Together, we’ll be co-hosting an interactive, multi-station “AI Playground” educational activation during the three days of the conference. Here are the five big AI questions. These will evolve but now we have a foundation to begin building consensus on how DMOs can capitalize on opportunities and navigate challenges with AI today. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The 5 Big AI Questions 1. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? A growing number of DMO leaders say their teams embrace AI for the most part, and many are actively developing basic AI strategy. That’s a significant shift from a year ago. At the same time, there's still varying degrees of cynicism and skepticism about AI in other organizations. I asked Weir about his staff. “I don't feel like we're dragging the team into this,” he said. “It's really more a matter of how people are at such different places with AI. So our goal is figuring out how to channel all their knowledge and energy, and kind of align and unify that, without stifling anyone’s creativity.” Scharf at Visit Denver emphasized that this question should be the first one, because successful AI integration begins with understanding your staff’s grasp of AI and their appetite for leaning into it. “ChatGPT is growing like Zoom did a few years ago so we know we need to use it,” he said. “The first thing we did was survey staff to assess how they feel about AI, and how or if they’re using it. Then we started off with small bites like email. Now we think of AI as a toolkit, and we're continuing to explore what tools are appropriate for different needs.” Port added that AI integration across teams works best with both structured and self-directed learning. “We started by making everything (ChatGPT Plus, Google Gemini) available to everyone, so they were given access to tools and resources, but a lot of this is really self-directed learning,” she said. “What we're seeing now is people have taken advantage of that and moved forward with it. Some maybe a little bit further than others, so maybe we need to address that. I think we still need more use cases and more structured learning because we're not all at the same level in terms of knowing and understanding how to put AI to use.” 2. How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? Destination Toronto was one of the first North American municipal DMOs to develop an AI policy. They began the process by pulling examples from larger government-operated tourism organizations including Destination Canada and Destination British Columbia. “We set up that policy structure first in terms of what we wanted as an organization, and also being very clear that any use of AI was meant to drive business results,” said Weir. “I think we were able to get there pretty quickly because we didn't create a series of regulations. We built a series of philosophies and principles to guide where we go. It was meant to put guardrails around protecting information, while at the same time, stimulate learning and sharing. Because we said to the team that you are free and encouraged to use AI, but there is an expectation that you will share what you've learned.” Port explained further that, “We leveraged existing processes already in place from a content perspective in terms of bias, IT usage, etc. We have an assessment process for any sort of software application that we're looking to use, so we did the same with AI.” (Note: The next GuideGeek Destination AI post will be with Kara Franker, president and CEO of Visit Florida Keys, who is also an attorney. We discussed AI policy at length.) 3. How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? Scharf stated that integrating AI platforms and processes beyond marketing is “where all the work is happening now.” His organization is switching out regular stand up meetings with extended AI workshops and visiting speakers to learn more about AI tools for various use cases across departments. Leadership, he said, including himself, are present at these meetings so everyone is learning together. Weir and Port both addressed this question, saying they need to first explore how Simpleview, Cvent and other tech partners are integrating AI functionality before looking at any new AI platforms. We discussed PCMA’s Project Spark , an AI-native event development tool that includes the new Destinaitor destination sourcing platform. DMO leadership and sales teams are exploring Spark to understand how clients are using new AI software to evaluate, compare and source destinations for business events. Others, like Kara Franker mentioned above, are looking for new AI solutions to optimize their HR and accounting departments, but she said many of the available options presently are only enterprise grade. Something DMOs should really look at, and I’m not sure how/if many already are, but there is proven value in creating custom GPTs for sales teams. GPTs are like mini ChatGPTs designed for specific purposes that anyone with a ChatGPT Plus account can create. For example, a sales rep can build a knowledge base inside a GPT by uploading sales materials, examples of successful bids, product information, pricing, team members, case studies, testimonials and other data. The next step is to develop internal GPT instructions to direct what the GPT does and what it prioritizes. Following that, the rep can then chat with the GPT and ask it to create a customized bid for a potential client that pulls all relevant source materials from the knowledge base that best supports the pitch. I’m imagining the ability to create custom GPTs is going to soon be a standard and required capability for all sales teams. One of the earliest enterprise examples of this was Salesforce’s Einstein GPT, which has since morphed into Agentforce. We use them at Matador because of improved efficiency and quality. GPTs also provide a new option for creative brainstorming, which some salespeople appreciate who don't identify as being super creative. Increases in sales production can be clearly identified. However, there's increasing conversation about tracking success in other departments. When AI delivers clear improvements in efficiency and saves people significant time, how do you measure that? One concern is that people will then just work a six hour day versus eight hours. The common thinking is that organizations will need to adjust productivity benchmarks, but this is a messy conversation. I don’t know enough to comment on that yet, but I wanted to put a pin in it because it’s something we’ll all need to look at eventually as AI scales in the workforce. 4. How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? I was addressing Visit Denver’s Board a while back and one member suggested that DMOs won’t need websites soon because they’ll be replaced by a ChatGPT-like window. I’m surprised by how much this comes up. For one thing, DMOs will always need some kind of online knowledge base for AI search queries. If anything, that will require more content and more comprehensive product information because AI search thrives more than anything on data structure, clarity and specificity. That said, the web user interface will likely evolve considerably. Expect to hear a lot more about how DMOs are developing data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to optimize data structure for AI search. For further context, here's a Perplexity Pro response to the question: "Are tourism boards developing data lakes and warehouses to optimize their sites for AI search?" Weir suggested that this conversation about the future of websites is not unlike what we went through 15 years ago, when people were lamenting the death of DMO sites because social media was deemed by some as the new web. More important, he asserted, is seeing how AI search is evolving and being prepared to adapt strategy. “I think there is a push-pull here between how we lead and where customers are at,” said Weir. “We want to deliver more information through our AI assistant and AI search in general, but customers aren't really there yet. I don't know what the percentage is, but the majority of people are still using Google. They're still beginning an interaction on the web by entering search terms in Google the traditional way. At some point, that's going to flip, right? It's going to be a few percent more each month or quarter, whatever that is. But how far ahead of it do we get? And how do we calibrate? We can try to lead on this, but you know, we also have to stay in step with where our customers are too.” 5. How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? Chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI have dashboards that clearly identify what visitors are asking about in the destination. That helps inform content and product development strategy, and the data is valuable for community engagement. AI chat platforms also operate 24/7 in 50+ languages, which helps DMO influence in-destination travel and spending for a much wider audience than ever before. How to best capitalize on conversational AI, and ultimately conversational commerce, is an evolving topic because we’re still in the early days where travelers are learning they can search with large language models and trust them. ChatGPT has 400 million weekly users but ChatGPT only added full functioning search capability for all users a few months ago. Consumers are just beginning to understand that they can now “talk” to a city. To help accelerate understanding and adoption of AI chat among visitors, Port asserted that the onus is on DMOs to promote their AI chat robustly like any other channel. Weir did that recently by highlighting Destination Toronto’s GuideGeek-powered “6ix” chat platform on LinkedIn, asking, “Ever had a chat directly with a city?” Weir was specifically promoting the organization’s WhatsApp platform, where people can now have a highly personalized, iterative conversation directly with Destination Toronto via the GuideGeek AI integration. The same functionality exists with the other Meta platforms, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. A few hours after Weir's post I received a Slack message from our CTO Stefan Klopp wondering what was going on in Toronto. WhatsApp volume was spiking, he said, and he was asking if Toronto had sent out a press release promoting 6ix, or something. No, it was just a quick CEO social media post. Also, Tourism New Zealand just launched a new campaign in collaboration with “A Minecraft Movie” that integrates GuideGeek-powered prompt questions to trigger further engagement. So, those are just a couple examples of how DMO/NTOs can drive AI chat engagement. The question for Weir and Port though is about the types of questions people are asking in AI chat platforms. Presently, a lot of the chat conversations are more utilitarian, related to queries about hotels, restaurants, attractions, events, directions, etc. So as conversational AI adoption increases, will DMOs focus more on developing content that answers those basic types of questions, like what hotel, restaurant or attraction is highly rated, and how to get there. Or, should DMOs continue to focus mainly on developing what is generally perceived as more inspirational destination and experiential content? "The question then becomes about responding to inquiries versus the inspirational side," explained Port. "Like, all of these articles, all of this content that we serve up, that is not in response to a question per se. It's more packaged to inspire people. I think a lot of that's going to have to exist outside our environments, maybe, whether it's influencers, it's your earned media strategy, it's content partnerships, things like that. That's where I think the inspiration will exist. But we really have to move to being more of the informative one, on our website or whatever a website is. But it needs to be very specific in answering questions. We already see that on GuideGeek." Weir summed up, saying, "I think this ends up relating more to, again, that question of where the customers are. Are we putting ourselves in a position to answer their questions and deliver the information in the way they're looking for it, using AI and the data lake approach? Or, are we curators like we've always been, inspiring visitors with local experiences, or is the customer now the curator by virtue of how they're asking questions today?" Summary These five takeaways are aligned with the five big AI questions. AI adoption begins with talking to DMO staff to understand what the organization is working with. Love the idea about marrying structured and self-directed learning, and being intentional about that with staff. At some point, for AI adoption to scale and continually evolve on an ongoing basis, there needs to be AI leaders in any organization who pick up the torch and inspire their colleagues to lean into AI. Otherwise, things tend to plateau with the same people using the same AI models. AI policy is intended to encourage staff to innovate with AI as much as it's meant to protect organizations. AI is the death of "I don't know," so it can benefit all staff in all departments. That in itself is enough ROI to validate initial investments in AI. The tools can provide a foundation of knowledge and direction for problem solving and strategic planning exponentially better than traditional search. Some organizations, like Visit Greece who we work with, have phenomenal website data structure ideally optimized for AI search. Meanwhile, one CEO told me "Our website is a mess with outdated content and poor data structure. We need to rebuild from scratch with AI search top of mind." Chat is the new marketplace, and AI is eating the entire funnel including in-destination. Moreover, AI chat data provides DMO leaders with insights into what visitors are asking about. Although, I think as chat adoption scales mainstream, the conversations will evolve beyond asking for a good hotel or restaurant. Greg Oates

Why Small Steps With AI Create Big Wins for Tourism Organizations Sep 22 Written By Greg Oates Key Theme: How to Align Strategic Risk Management and Progressive AI Implementation The rush to transform everything with AI has dominated boardroom discussions since ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Yet the most successful organizations aren't pursuing wholesale AI overhauls. They're taking calculated, incremental steps that deliver real value while building capabilities for the future. MIT researchers interviewed senior managers at 21 large companies actively using generative AI. Their findings challenge the prevailing narrative about AI transformation. Companies are deliberately choosing "small t" transformations over risky, large-scale implementations. This approach works particularly well for tourism organizations where customer trust and regulatory compliance matter deeply. Tourism organizations face unique challenges with AI adoption. Customer data privacy concerns run high. Regulatory requirements vary across jurisdictions. Service quality directly impacts reputation. The research reveals that successful companies treat AI implementation like climbing a risk slope. They start with low-risk internal applications before moving to customer-facing solutions. This measured approach isn't about being timid. It's about being smart. Tourism CEOs can build organizational confidence, develop necessary skills, and demonstrate tangible value before tackling more complex implementations. Start With Universal Productivity Tools That Employees Already Want to Use The research uncovered a surprising reality. Employees were already using ChatGPT and other public AI tools without permission. Companies responded by providing secure, private versions of these tools. This grassroots adoption pattern offers tourism organizations a clear starting point. Consider how your marketing team writes destination descriptions. Your operations staff creates training materials. Your finance team prepares reports. These tasks consume hours of employee time across every department. Private AI instances from providers like ChatGPT or Claude eliminate security concerns while boosting productivity. McKinsey built a custom platform called Lilli that connects AI to 40 internal knowledge sources. The result? Seventy-five percent employee adoption in under a year. Time savings up to 30%. Substantially improved work quality. Tourism organizations don't need to build something this sophisticated initially. Even basic AI writing assistants can transform daily work. Microsoft Copilot integration takes this further. Employees can search across company documents instantly. They can pull content from emails, meeting transcripts, and presentations. One manager described it as having "a super search engine" for company information. Imagine your team finding that obscure policy document from three years ago in seconds rather than hours. The beauty of starting here? Minimal risk. Maximum adoption. Employees want these tools. They're probably already using consumer versions. Providing enterprise versions addresses security concerns while meeting existing demand. Your IT team maintains control. Your employees get productivity gains. Everyone wins. Some employees will still seek external tools for specific needs. One product manager uses Midjourney for quick visuals. Another uses voice-to-text tools for performance reviews. Accept this reality. Focus on providing core tools internally while establishing clear guidelines for external tool usage. Deploy AI for Specific Roles While Keeping Humans in Control Once basic AI tools gain traction, tourism organizations can target specific job functions. The key insight from the research? Maintain human oversight for quality control. This "human in the loop" approach reduces risk while capturing efficiency gains. Customer service represents an ideal starting point for tourism organizations. AI can help agents find information quickly. It can suggest responses in real time. It can analyze call patterns to identify coaching opportunities. MIT researchers found AI coaching tools increased call center productivity by 14% on average. New and low-skilled workers improved by 34%. Morgan Stanley equipped financial advisors with an AI assistant trained on over one million internal documents. The tool doesn't replace advisors. It helps them find information faster so they can focus on customer relationships. Tourism organizations can apply this same principle. Help your concierge staff access local recommendations instantly. Enable tour guides to answer obscure historical questions accurately. Support reservation agents with instant access to availability across properties. CarMax demonstrates another powerful application. The company uses AI to generate descriptions for over 5,000 car pages. Manual creation would take multiple humans 11 years. With AI, it takes hours. The 80% approval rate from editorial review proves quality doesn't suffer. Tourism organizations can apply this to property descriptions, tour summaries, and destination guides. Creative teams at Dentsu use AI throughout their workflow. From proposals to budgeting to ideation. The emerging technology director noted employees spend less time on mundane tasks. They create higher-quality content with less effort. Tourism marketing teams can similarly accelerate campaign development, social media content creation, and promotional material design. Finance departments traditionally resist new technology. Yet some organizations successfully use AI for audit reports, regulatory compliance, and fraud detection. Amazon's finance team reports employees shifted from repetitive tasks to critical thinking work. Tourism organizations can start with expense report processing or invoice matching before tackling complex financial analysis. Transform Customer Experiences Gradually With Clear Boundaries Customer-facing AI sits highest on the risk slope. Yet the potential rewards justify careful exploration. The research shows companies succeeding by setting clear boundaries and expanding gradually. Chatbots evolved from frustrating phone trees to sophisticated conversational agents. John Hancock's insurance chatbots handle common queries effectively. Human agents focus on complex issues. Starbucks, Domino's, and CVS expanded to voice interactions. Video interactions come next. Tourism organizations can start with FAQ chatbots on their websites. Add booking assistance once that works well. Expand to voice-based concierge services when ready. Personalization transforms online shopping experiences. Tapestry, parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, uses real-time language modifications. The conversational tone mimics in-store associates. Revenue increased at least 3%. Tourism organizations can personalize trip recommendations based on past bookings. Adjust website content for different traveler segments. Customize email campaigns for individual preferences. Software companies already embed AI throughout their products. Adobe users create and modify images effortlessly. Canva simplifies presentation creation. Lucidchart converts text descriptions into flowcharts. Tourism organizations benefit as their existing software vendors add AI features. Property management systems will suggest optimal pricing. Booking platforms will predict cancellation risks. Marketing tools will automate campaign optimization. The key? Start small. Test thoroughly. Expand gradually. A failed internal productivity tool frustrates employees. A failed customer-facing AI damages your brand. Move up the risk slope deliberately. Build Foundational Capabilities Before Attempting Major Transformations The research revealed an uncomfortable truth. Scaling AI from pilot to production is harder than expected. Data quality issues multiply. Edge cases appear more frequently. Integration challenges compound. Many organizations discovered they needed stronger foundations before pursuing ambitious AI projects. CarMax's chief information officer emphasized data quality. "Good data will give you good results from AI." Poor data produces unreliable outputs. Tourism organizations must audit their data systems. Customer records across multiple systems need reconciliation. Historical booking data requires cleaning. Property information needs standardization. Governance structures matter equally. Who approves AI projects? How do you measure success? What happens when AI makes mistakes? Establish these frameworks before scaling implementations. Small pilots can proceed without perfect governance. Enterprise deployments cannot. Capital One's chief scientist warned against the "gold-rush mentality." Thoughtful, responsible implementation beats rushed deployment. Build the scaffolding to bring everyone along. Tourism organizations should resist pressure to match competitors' AI announcements. Focus on sustainable progress over headlines. Management buy-in proves essential for larger projects. One technology company's AI efforts stagnated until the CEO personally championed them. Small wins build credibility for bigger investments. Document productivity gains from initial deployments. Share customer satisfaction improvements. Make the business case concrete before requesting major funding. Summary: Small Transformations Today Enable Big Transformations Tomorrow The research delivers a clear message for tourism CEOs. Successful AI implementation doesn't require revolutionary change. It requires evolutionary progress. Start with universal productivity tools that employees already want. Target specific roles with human oversight. Transform customer experiences within careful boundaries. Build foundational capabilities systematically. This approach particularly suits tourism organizations. Your business depends on human connections. Technology should enhance these connections, not replace them. Your customers value authentic experiences. AI should enable better experiences, not artificial ones. Your reputation takes years to build and moments to destroy. Measured AI deployment protects what you've built while enabling future growth. The companies studied aren't waiting for perfect AI solutions. They're using today's technology to solve real problems while preparing for tomorrow's possibilities. They're training employees, cleaning data, and establishing governance. When breakthrough AI capabilities arrive, they'll be ready to capitalize quickly. Tourism organizations can follow this same path. Deploy AI writing assistants next month. Add customer service chatbots next quarter. Enhance personalization next year. Each step builds on the last. Each success enables the next. Small transformations compound into competitive advantage. The AI transformation race isn't won by the fastest starter. It's won by consistent, strategic progress. Tourism CEOs who embrace "small t" transformation today position their organizations for "big T" transformation tomorrow. The journey starts with a single step up the risk slope. Greg Oates

How to Develop AI Strategy for Your Organization Oct 12 Written By Greg Oates The 2050 City AI Roadmap provides a high-level strategic framework for how DMOs and other organizations can capitalize on AI to optimize internal operations, resources and knowledge, and ultimately, drive partner revenue. DMOs have all kinds of strategic plans, master plans, business and marketing plans, etc. The 2050 City AI Roadmap outlines the process to develop your AI strategic plan. It defines the big picture outlook for AI as the future of commerce, and it proposes a methodology to help DMO leaders prioritize, organize and navigate how they go about integrating AI across their organization. Presently, we're rolling this out with Visit Mesa , Tourism Richmond in British Columbia, and The Florida Keys & Key West . The three CEOs for those organizations have all agreed to share takeaways and business outcomes with each others' teams to cross-pollinate learning and accelerate AI process integration. That spirit of knowledge sharing and co-learning for me is huge, because we as an industry are all pretty much flying blindly with AI from a macro perspective. Yes, we've come a long way in the last year. Every DMO CEO I talk to these days is now implementing various AI processes and seeing value. However, we're all kind of flying this plane while we're building it at the same time, and we don't really have a destination, or even due north, in mind. The 2050 City AI Roadmap was designed to identify where we're going with this emergent technology that's both incredibly powerful and often highly unpredictable. It also defines how high-end AI chat platforms, like Matador Network's GuideGeek AI , are the tip of the spear for agentic commerce. The following guidelines are based on experience in the workplace to deliver new value with AI for your team, board, industry partners and community stakeholders. Internal & External Direction Every decision related to AI strategy should first be defined through an internal or external lens. Your board members will typically view internal workplace optimization as tactical. Externally, AI integrations that are consumer-facing and revenue generating are usually perceived as more strategic. Internal Facing From an internal standpoint, the focus of the AI Roadmap is on optimizing operations to take advantage of an organization's aggregate of resources and knowledge. Imagine the totality of insights across every team member in terms of their expertise and networks in their communities. AI systems are designed to pool and capitalize on that, but only if an organization's knowledge base is structured intelligently. That means rebuilding your folder structures and files naming conventions so an AI can find everything. According to Slack, workers spend 41% of their time on menial tasks, including endless hours just looking for information. The overall losses related to productivity, quality of work and workplace, and physical/mental health are crazy. So let's start there with AI strategy to address our internal digital dumpster fire. External Facing Externally, from a marketing, sales and visitor/partner engagement perspective, AI strategy begins with integrating a robust AI chat platform like GuideGeek. DMOs have never really had proprietary information on who their visitors are. They have geo-location, credit card spend, event attendance data, etc., which show visitor behavior. But none of those really identify visitor motivations and mindsets indepth. With an AI chat platform, DMOs can now pull analytics showing what visitors are actually asking and what they want to know on an individual and aggregate basis. We launched our new GuideGeek V2 analytics dashboard this past week, which provides deeper, fuller insights into visitor psychographics. That data then informs all kinds of resource allocation decisions related to content development, AI SEO strategy, data analysis, product and destination development, community engagement, etc. CEO Roles AI is best defined as a new digital "co-intelligence" that can communicate, reason and create for the first time ever, versus just another new technology. We emphasize that AI is really a new environment for collaboration more than anything, just not solely among humans anymore. Learning AI is not like learning Photoshop. You can only "teach" AI up to a point, like trying to teach someone how to ride a bike. You can't teach a child how to stay on two wheels without falling in a classroom. He or she actually has to start pedaling, and eventually the child's mind and body basically have a conversation, so to speak, with the bike to grasp the fundamentals of moving forward successfully. Same with AI. The only way to learn AI is to use AI. Helping human teams embrace this new co-intelligence (and it's not like there's a choice) falls under the umbrella of change management. That's a CEO's wheelhouse. It will take more than a few years for many humans to reconcile their minds and values with this new relationship, and it falls on the CEO's shoulders to steward that reconciliation. Likewise, CEOs oversee AI governance, policy and privacy. I've shared before how AI governance should be viewed less like a car brake and more like a steering wheel to inform, direct and accelerate AI adoption and integration. Lastly, only CEOs can scale long-term AI benefits and business outcomes effectively. You can't really delegate this. AI efforts will plateau at times, some or many AI experimentations will fail, and there are always staff members who will drag their feet because they just don't like AI. DMO CEOs are chief people officers and it's on them to create the right culture for scaling AI platforms and processes effectively for everyone in their crews. Agentic AI This is where things get interesting. AI agents and agentic commerce might sound super confusing for many or most staff members. Lots of land mines to watch out for, sure, but even more reasons for us building a macro DMO AI strategic framework. One of the key objectives for the AI Roadmap is to elevate AI agents and agentic commerce as the two interrelated cornerstones for AI strategy, and explain why. Doing so shows the true big picture value of AI, and it drives home how we eventually need to move way beyond training people the basics of prompting. Yes, it's intimidating, but we introduce the labels and contexts relating to agentic AI early on in the process. That gets some people thinking bigger about AI, and it entices the AI champions in the group to start experimenting with agents. AI Agents (Internal) For internal AI strategy, leading DMOs are developing AI agents and automated workflows to address the aforementioned 41% of time that staff members spend on grunt work and trying to find information. They are proven, they work, and most of all, they deliver measurable ROI. We're working with outside contractors at Matador to develop and implement agents and automations for both ourselves internally and for DMO clients. We are already seeing success, and there's been a recent influx among our people asking for agents. It's an amazing thing to see when staff members start requesting new AI integrations like that, proactively. That's when you know your AI strategy is working at least on some level. Agentic Commerce (External) AI agents are also the foundation for agentic commerce. According to Mastercard , "Agentic commerce is a new form of online and mobile shopping, in which an AI agent 'closes the loop' or completes tasks for a user — such as searching for items, comparing options and making a purchase — with limited or no manual inputs needed from that user. For example, while chatting in a generative AI app, you could tell the AI agent, 'Book me a nonstop flight to London for under $600 next week — no red-eyes,' and the agent will review airlines, nearby airports and your loyalty memberships and payment card rewards to identify the best option, purchase it and then share it with you." Just like with AI agents, developing agentic commerce architecture covers a wide spectrum of sophistication and capabilities. Going back to the analogy of flying a plane while building it with no clear final destination in mind, agentic commerce is the point on the map where we want to land. With GuideGeek, we have Kayak, GetYourGuide, Skyscanner and other booking tools integrated into the platform with a click-through UX/UI. Looking ahead, we're working with one national tourism organization to bring some of their national partners' booking engines (air, hotel, tour op, etc.,) into the platform to eventually convert sales in-chat. Subscribe to Mastercard Signals to keep up-to-date on agentic commerce and access intelligence like this Mastercard Payments Trends Navigator report. Staff Training & AI Integration Training staff and implementing AI processes across all departments is really the meat of the 2050 City Roadmap. But none of that should proceed without DMO leadership embracing all the above, and communicating it clearly to all staff. Easier said than done, though. Leadership needs to continually communicate a high-level approach to AI strategy, because it won't really click for many staff (or leadership) at the beginning of this process. That, of course, needs to be married with all the practical training initiatives we're continuing to develop. We've already learned a ton with the present work we're doing training DMO teams. Here are a few very basic takeaways just to start explaining our process. There are obviously many more educational modules following these, ranging from predictive analytics to specific department AI training in areas like HR, finance and legal. Conduct an internal AI survey asking all staff to share their perceptions and usage of AI. Follow that up with small group interviews across the organization, and transcribe everything with an AI notetaker. We use Granola, but there are many others. Also, explain to staff that all meetings regarding AI will be recorded to create an internal knowledge base to identify opportunities, challenges and takeaways over time. Start training with a focus on just the paid/pro models of ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. Some staff feel confused with the sheer variety of available AI tools in front of them. We explain that, at the end of the day, the basics of using AI include an end user, an AI tool, and a knowledge base. Get people on board with that, and then show how most of the AI tools they have access to are similar in many ways. One of the fastest methods to advance AI understanding is showing staff how to create custom GPTs in ChatGPT. Some team members will pick up on these quickly and start integrating them into their workflows right away. These are the people who typically make up your internal AI taskforce. Explain and show how Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot are AI workhorses that connect with the majority of people's daily workflows. However, humans tend to think of those as just the next evolution of search engines. This is mental wiring that needs to be broken. Gemini and Copilot are great/good in some ways, but I've found that training staff on just those three native LLMs first (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) is more effective for seeing the light. Google NotebookLM has a lot of fans. I like to walk teams through it because it's a good way to reinforce what a knowledge base is, like we do with the custom GPTs. Also, the automated audio and video podcasts are crowd pleasers, especially with the new Join function where users can engage directly with the agentic podcast hosts. People don't seem to want to read anymore. This was a rude awakening for us when we first launched the AI Roadmap with a series of online training materials. We now know we need to deliver short video instruction if we want anyone to actually look at the educational content. People love Descript for AI-powered video creation. Once we started showing how to use Descript, we were pleasantly surprised to see how staff really leaned in. Teaching Descript provides a fun break early in the process because people can see pretty amazing results in minutes and wrap their minds around the process fairly easily. Ask all staff to share how they're using AI effectively and where they see AI failing them. Catalogue the case studies and share across the organization to accelerate learning, inspire a healthy sense of internal competition, and track learning over time. Staff members are also often wowed seeing AI agents in action. We use n8n to develop agents, where you can create a lot of basic automated workflows quickly. Once a few early adopters see how agents can take over some of their more tedious, time-consuming tasks, others will jump in. Feedback Loop & Funding/Board Support This line in the AI Roadmap is broken down into tactical internal optimization and more strategic, consumer-facing and revenue-generating sales, marketing and stakeholder engagement. I don't have a lot to share for this section and the following one because our focus to date has been mostly on the above phases. Feedback Loop The reason we record every engagement with AI Roadmap clients is to scale learning, so if one person learns something, everyone can benefit. That will be further multiplied when we starting sharing takeaways across DMOS, and eventually the industry as a whole. Visit Mesa, Tourism Richmond and Visit Florida Keys are eager to lead this initiative, and we plan to launch a new AI thought leadership framework collectively in 2026. Funding & Board Support The spark that led to developing the AI Roadmap happened almost a year ago when a board member for a large DMO told me that she viewed AI integration as merely a tactic. If this work can elevate AI in the minds of board members toward a more high-level strategic imperative, then we'll have achieved part of our mission. There's still some work to be done first though to collect more case studies showing direct AI business outcomes before we can make a more solid case for additional funding for AI integrations. AI Strategic Plan We've produced a mockup of what we think an AI Strategic Plan will eventually look like, but it's too early to show presently. For now, we've identified three overarching pillars, each with potential strategies, action items, timelines and targets. The KPIs are crucial, of course, for scaling AI strategy across the travel industry. Right now, we're thinking the three pillars might look like the following, although this is all up in the air right now: Optimize Internal Operations & Knowledge: The strategies include cleaning up internal folders/files to improve AI outcomes in general and develop AI agents specifically. A lot in here on training, experimentation, overall adoption, success measures, etc. Increase Partner Revenue with Agentic AI: Defining how DMOs develop AI agents to fuel agentic commerce is the big goal overall with the AI Roadmap. Initial strategies in this pillar begin with more low hanging fruit though, such as website redevelopment, optimizing for AI SEO, AI chat integration, etc. Expand Community Collaboration: We're seeing more DMOs take a leading role in AI education for their industry and community stakeholders. The 2050 City Roadmap is perfectly suited for informing how DMO leaders can facilitate community AI workshops and increase the organization's overall relevance and value. Greg Oates

Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Kara Franker , president and CEO of The Florida Keys & Key West tourism organization, was among the first DMO leaders to embrace AI platforms and processes in 2023 when she was chief executive at Visit Estes Park in Colorado. In May 2024, Franker published two papers on AI strategy and policy: From the Base of the Rocky Mountains to the World: A case study through Visit Estes Park’s journey into Generative AI solutions — and how your DMO can carve its own AI path Navigating AI and the Law in the Travel Industry: An Introduction to Legal Implications for DMOs The first paper highlights how Visit Estes Park integrated GuideGeek AI chat into their website and three Meta platforms: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The DMO also branded the chat Rocky Mountain Roamer to give it an identity and bit of personality. The second paper focused on AI policy and data privacy, security and compliance. Franker, who is an attorney, co-wrote that with Roxanne Steinhoff , also an attorney at Steinhoff Law, who leads the firm’s destination marketing and sports tourism practice. I caught up with Franker to see how her perspectives on AI strategy and policy are evolving almost a year later. Greg Oates: You've been leading AI strategy in tourism for almost two years beginning with your work at Visit Estes Park. However, there’s still a lack of AI training today specific for DMO CEOs, and many leaders are presently unsure how to proceed with AI. As a CEO, what’s your take on that? Kara Franker: I'm not surprised that there's a lack of training because there's just so much for everybody to wrap their heads around. I think some people are trying to watch and wait and see. My philosophy has been more of a fall-forward, fail-forward kind of approach. That's why I put the white papers out. Anybody could learn from what we had done, and do it better. You know, a case study is sometimes the best way to figure this stuff out, so that's why we did it. The second paper on AI policy was with Roxanne Steinhoff on the legal and ethical implications of AI. Because when I would go and speak in front of groups, those were always the big questions from the leadership. They don't know how far is too far once you open this can of worms. That's why we got together and started to put guardrails in place that we thought might make sense for people to study, just as a first stab at it. That all launched last summer, so I do think that there's a little bit of education out there but we could definitely use more. GO: What do DMOs need to know about AI policy at a very high level in terms of privacy and security? KF: Employee and client information should be kept private and not uploaded into any AI tools. That could be a big deal, thinking of all the different rules and regulations about collecting information, especially how it's more stringent in Europe than in the United States. That can cause potential problems if you're uploading, say, a client list that has personal cell phones, email addresses or other information that people just don't want out there. So, it's really more about information that's attached to a person. And then, is there competitive data that you don't necessarily want others to have? Possibly, but so much of what we do in the DMO space is public anyways so the lines for that are pretty blurry. I’m trying to imagine a scenario where a DMO is, like, basically hacking somebody else's information through AI. I can’t imagine that’s worth the time and effort, or even possible. GO: A few months ago we were discussing what AI tools might be available for DMO departments like HR and accounting to help with privacy, compliance, efficiency, etc. But everything available seems to be enterprise grade and out of reach for DMOs. So what’s the answer for scaling AI across an organization? KF: I think this is a huge need. I hired somebody from Cisco who’s my new VP of technology and partnerships. She's a total AI nerd like I am, and way more qualified to dive into all this. She and I have been looking at different options to put together, almost like little plugins. We really, really need this. For example, how do we take an AI solution from the legal world to analyze all our contracts so that we don't have to spend as many hours with attorneys, because we really just need a template, right? And then for HR, same thing. How do we organize all our employee files into a much more streamlined and effective system? And then there’s our policies. We're a nonprofit but everything we do is so heavily influenced by County government. We have so many compliance issues, so I want an AI to learn every single piece of County policies so we’re able to compare and contrast what we're doing with those policies. I haven't been able to find anything to help with these things. We've looked at a lot of different options but it's like what you're saying. They're these big enterprise pieces built for law firms or financial people, and they’re all really expensive. None of them fit the mold for improving different operations at a DMO. In my mind, the marketing side is covered, especially with GuideGeek, and there are so many great options now for everything involved with marketing. So I feel like that's been tackled and done really well. But for the operations, we need more. I mean, we’ve just got to keep digging deeper, I think. GO: When you and your technology person from Cisco figure all this out, will you share what you find with the rest of us? KF: Of course, always. GO: Backing up a bit, you were arguably the very first DMO CEO to lean into AI, at least in North America, when you were with Visit Estes Park. How did you convince your board that investing in AI was important at the time, and what were some of your processes with bringing along staff? KF: We were fortunate in the sense that the board was all in and the staff were all in. And I don't mean to make age a part of it, but the staff was a little on the young side and they were all very ambitious. Everybody wanted to try to figure it out. So we made the argument to the board, if we could figure out some of what AI could do, it would make the community stronger and they could take pieces of it back to their businesses. There wasn't really anybody who was against experimenting and trying it out. We made some mistakes along the way and we put that in the white paper. Also, when we first rolled out GuideGeek, which scrapes the website, we found a few holes in our content. There were particular board members who didn't have very robust information about their business, so they got a little bit mad, but not in a, like, burn it down way. It was more of, "Oh, okay, we have some work to do." So part of the AI process has to actually be community outreach. It can't just be about the technology. We have to talk to all our partners and get really robust information from them, so when the AI crawls the site it gets the best possible information about our partners. GO: One thing you did at Visit Estes Park was brand your GuideGeek AI as Rocky Mountain Roamer on your website and three Meta platforms. We use that as a case study a lot, and emphasize that a DMO should promote their AI just like any other channel, right? KF: Definitely. We knew we had to put money behind marketing the tool if we wanted people to interact with it. Traditionally with a DMO, one of your calls to action is to send people to the website. Our new call to action for a lot of our campaigns back then was to send people to the AI, so we called it Rocky Mountain Roamer to help promote and drive traffic to it. And then in terms of KPIs, we wanted to track all the interactions you can see in the backend, but not just how many people used it. We wanted to know how long people interacted with the AI, what their journey was, and what they were asking about because that’s where things get really interesting. GO: After the initial thrill of launching GuideGeek, how did you manage how staff used AI internally? Were there any incentives involved to help spur adoption and experimentation? KF: The incentive for my team was, well, it wasn't really an incentive. It was a requirement. They had to write weekly reports for me about how they tested something with AI, whatever it was. It could apply to their job or not, I didn't really care. So I almost forced them to try AI. But then people started really getting into it. They were getting more and more user friendly with different AI tools, and they would be like, “Oh, I like Anthropic because of this or that,” because they were branching out from just using ChatGPT. So, yeah, there has to be almost like a culture of AI in your DMO for it to really work, and it's on the CEO to create and foster that. Greg Oates

Join Matador Network's AI Playground at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Matador Network, GuideGeek AI and U.S. Travel are launching the inaugural "AI Playground" at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix, August 17-19. The educational space, hands-on demo area, genius bar and live sessions will run all three days during the conference. We are also producing programming specific for travel industry CEOs, along with other sessions dedicated for senior executives, highlighting actionable AI strategies focusing on real world business outcomes. Leading up to ESTO, I'll be reaching out to many of you requesting any AI-related success stories and/or questions you might have for the AI Playground. Looking back over the last two years, it's clear the industry is turning a corner in 2025 when it comes to AI learning and adoption. Many DMOs and their industry partners are now integrating AI processes and platforms across their organizations, whereas last year many destination leaders were still in wait-and-see mode. For those of you still on the fringes, it is our ambition that the AI Playground will plant a flag in the ground showing how AI is now a proven strategy for helping DMOs further deliver on their mandate. "AI is clearly powering the future of travel and how people explore the world today," says Ross Borden, founder and CEO of Matador Network. "We are stoked to be working with U.S. Travel and investing in our industry to produce the AI Playground. AI will become standard operating procedure for every DMO soon, and we're excited to help lead this journey." DMO CEOs on AI Strategy Matador launched its proprietary GuideGeek AI chat platform for DMO websites and social media channels almost two years ago. We now have more than 40 DMOs onboard, and we're expanding the scope of GuideGeek AI with new hotel groups and tour operators joing in recent months. Based on our experience working with municipal, regional and national organizations across the global visitor industry, we have unparalleled insights into how conversational AI is changing the relationship between destinations and visitors, as well as how DMOs operate internally. In preparation for ESTO 2025, we launched this GuideGeek Destination AI newsletter in January to ramp up our industry outreach and further expand our understanding of how DMO leaders are navigating the rise of AI. Here are five stories from the newsletter that inform high-level decision making related to AI strategy, with input from more than 15 CEO DMOs: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI : Our first post with 12 DMO CEOs highlighted the wide range of questions they have. One asked for the five big AI questions he should know about. Another wants practical advice on five AI initiatives that he can implement, like, tomorrow. Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism : CEO Royce Chwin, who helms Destination Vancouver, shared why his organization was one of the first DMOs in the world to dive into AI. Destination Toronto & Visit Denver CEOs on the 5 Big AI Questions in Tourism : Two chief executives, Andrew Weir in Toronto and Richard Scharf in Denver, worked out what they believe are the five big AI themes/questions that DMOs need to focus on, as touched on in the first post. Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation : Newly installed Florida Keys CEO Kara Franker, who is also an attorney, shed light on AI policy, compliance and the need for more non-enterprise AI solutions for her organization. Visit Mesa CEO Launches New DMO AI Road Map : Another visionary DMO chief executive, Visit Mesa leader Marc Garcia is bringing a new level of structure and direction for integrating AI processes and platforms. Next up, Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau, will be discussing AI strategy from a business events perspective. I also met with Cody Chomiak, vice president of marketing at Travel Manitoba, who's really lighting a fire in Canada around AI thought leadership and adoption. He'll be sharing a few powerful AI case studies from his provincial marketing organization, both internal and visitor-facing. AI Playground at ESTO 2025 The AI Playground this year will feature three stations at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge . We will have our Matador GuideGeek team and U.S. Travel staff on hand to guide participants through the space, along with some invited AI experts from around the industry. We'll be digging into a handful of paid AI models including ChatGPT Plus/Teams, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro, Google AI Pro, Microsoft Copilot Pro and Manus. We'll show how AI is best navigated at DMOs by bucketing strategy into three unique categories: Search, Create and Sales. Specific use cases will include content generation and data analysis, AI SEO and AI-optimized web development, AI policy and governance, staff adoption, building custom GPTs for sales proposals, and automated workflows and AI agents, among others. The three stations are: The Prompt Lab welcomes all attendees to come in and test drive various AI models. The interactive, hands-on learning station will have multiple laptops for experimenting with AI tools for people of all skill levels. We'll have a bunch of paid AI models pre-loaded for live demos and one-on-one conversations showing how AI actually works and some of what it accomplishes across different departments. Feel free to bring your own laptop if you like. The Genius Bar is designed for individual and group Q&A about real world AI strategy, implementation and ROI. We'll be collecting all the questions posed to share with the broader industry afterward, so we'll have a couple crowdsourcing boards to help generate new ideas and explore new solutions. Reach out to me if you want to schedule time to talk during ESTO. The AI Theater seating area will host a range of AI-focused dialogues, micro-presentations and a few dedicated sessions designed for CEOs, as well as other senior executives. The programming schedule for all those will engagements be included in the ESTO agenda. Most importantly, all the conversations at the AI Playground will highlight tangible AI case studies and specific business outcomes. The 5 Big Questions About AI One of the best things to come out of all the interviews with DMO CEOs this year is our list of the five big AI questions that chief executives need to focus on. These questions will likely evolve a bit, but for now they're providing direction for how we're developing the AI Playground and how DMOs are moving forward with AI integration. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? I would love to hear your feedback on any the above and how we can make the ESTO 2025 AI Playground as valuable as possible for you and your teams. Reach out at greg@matadornetwork.com . Greg Oates

Visit Mesa CEO Launches New AI Roadmap Aug 25 Written By Greg Oates Visit Mesa in Arizona kicked off a new internal initiative this week to integrate AI processes and platforms across the organization. I worked with Visit Mesa to help develop their new DMO AI Roadmap, which provides a 5-phase strategic framework that most any visitor organization can use as a template. The project officially began this week during Visit Mesa’s spring board meeting to communicate why the organization is moving forward with AI to optimize the DMO’s value for Mesa’s visitor industry and the local community. Marc Garcia, CATP , president and CEO of Visit Mesa, has been eager to start this initiative. He was one of the dozen CEOs who contributed to the first GuideGeek Destination AI story a few months back, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI. For that deep dive into a CEO's mindset regarding AI, Garcia asked: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” The Visit Mesa DMO AI Roadmap answers those questions. “I've recognized that AI is extremely important not only for the world moving forward, but specifically for our industry,” Garcia explained at the beginning of this project. “We at Visit Mesa need to get out in front of it. Even as a small to medium-sized DMO with our budget, we've always taken pride in the fact that we’re typically at the forefront of the latest and greatest in terms of technology, and so this is just an extension of that.” The following is a high-level overview of the DMO AI Roadmap and each of the five phases. However, like all strategic planning, there is a big jump between developing a plan and executing it effectively. This is especially true with internal AI training. In any given organization today, there is often a wide breadth of how people perceive AI and how proficient they are with AI models. It will take time to educate and align everyone around shared benefits for the organizations and staff, expected processes, intended outcomes and success metrics. Visit Mesa AI Roadmap The DMO AI Roadmap is a structured, phased approach for educating staff and integrating AI across DMO departments. The goals for the roadmap are to optimize internal operations, enhance sales and marketing outcomes, inspire staff self-learning, future-proof the organization, and contribute to how well local industry and community leaders adopt AI best practices and benefit from them. There are two imperatives that should be established and agreed upon among leadership at the very beginning. Integrating AI processes and platforms is an imperative for the DMO to ensure its relevancy and long-term impact in the local visitor economy. If leadership doesn’t fully believe that, this strategic framework won’t work. AI proficiency is an imperative for staff members for their future growth and marketability. That said, you can’t really force people to embrace, learn and use AI intentionally, but the job market will. The following phases are highly fluid and some of the processes can be rolled out concurrently. Ultimately, these phases provide structure for effectively and responsibly implementing a new technology that has no precedent. Because of generative AI, machines can now do three things they haven’t been able to do before. They have the ability to reason, the ability to communicate, and the ability to generate stuff based on that reasoning and communication. Meaning, AI is messy. Integrating it into our daily workflows is also messy because it's challenging us to rethink our relationship with technology. But as Kate Yordi, director of marketing at Visit Mesa, said during the board meeting this week, “Finally, we have some direction.” Phase 1: Leadership Alignment & Staff Communication As discussed at length in previous Destination AI posts, the DMO CEO must make it clear to all staff that the organization prioritizes AI because the organization prioritizes being relevant. It certainly helps, as is the case with Visit Mesa, when the CEO is fully backed by the board to invest in AI integration. During the board meeting, one member asked, “What do you need from us, Marc?” That’s a good sign. For the DMO AI Roadmap to work, all leadership needs to not only have a basic understanding of AI tools, they need to actually use them as well on a regular basis. That goes a long way in driving agency across the organization. However, making that happen typically requires some C-suite training to explain the primary AI models more indepth: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot and/or Google Gemini depending on the specific workplace platform(s) the organization uses. Identifying and prioritizing just a handful of AI models like that brings a lot of clarity to the process right off the bat. You see people's shoulders relax when they're confronted with 5-6 AIs versus dozens. (Yes, VEED, Gamma, Manus, Sora, Granola, Slack AI, etc., are all really cool but let's not start there.) A common lament among DMO leadership related to AI is, “Where do we even start?” Leadership should then discuss and begin to answer the five big questions all CEOs face when navigating AI integration, as vetted in the aforementioned Destination AI post about what CEOs want regarding AI education: How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI (who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI) to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and quality of work? How do we redevelop our content and channels to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI for business purposes to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The next step in this phase, at a basic level, is communicating to staff why they’re being asked to embrace AI. The following is not meant to be comprehensive, but a CEO would likely want to articulate: The purpose of the AI Roadmap, guiding principles, and the phases and processes involved How AI integration will take time and people will evolve at different paces It’s ok if everyone feels like they’re building the plane while flying it Everyone is encouraged to use AI and will be supported, but there will also be guardrails in place AI adoption and use cases will become part of employee reviews, but traditional roles, responsibilities and key success metrics are still the priority "How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents." — Marc Garcia, president and CEO, Visit Mesa Phase 2: Staff Assessment & AI Task Force Sitting down and asking staff how they feel about AI and how/if they’re using it is a good way to begin. Depending on the size of the organization, this can be done with every staff member individually or a representative group from each department. Generally people fall into three camps when it comes to AI: 1) Those who are already using AI on a regular basis; 2) those who are curious and have experimented a bit, but they don’t actively engage with AI tools; and 3) those who don’t see much value in AI. This last group can also include people who outright oppose AI, but they make themselves apparent pretty quickly. Data also shows there is often a significant percentage of staff who use AI in secret because they’re not sure they’re allowed to use it for work purposes. The second way to collect staff sentiment and AI capacity is with a blind online survey asking everyone what they like about AI, what concerns them, how they feel about job security, what they want to learn, what they hope to achieve, etc. Everything is anonymous so you can expect a wide variety of feedback ranging from constructive/optimistic to fears of an impending robot apocalypse. Once complete, all the data should be synthesized into key takeaways for leadership and shared with staff to show a high level of transparency right from the beginning of this process. The second part of this phase is developing an AI task force. The value of this cannot be overemphasized. Choose a small group of AI champions from various departments to do three things: Provide direction for stewarding the various processes in each phase as effectively as possible from beginning to end Share constructive and thoughtful input they’re hearing from other staff members about how things are proceeding well and where there are challenges Help scale AI adoption across teams by showing how they’re using AI effectively to everyone else in the organization An internal AI task force or council is invaluable because the members are motivated and they want to learn. Mostly, their enthusiasm and success with AI will begin to rub off on many of their colleagues and inspire self-learning and greater adoption among the teams. But not all. There will be those who disengage, and there can be a significant number of them. Over time, they should be consulted to understand their trepidation, which should then be addressed. This is a challenge I'm having with one organization where a significant cohort are saying they're too busy to learn AI. Meanwhile, the majority of the staff are reporting daily usage with effective results, which definitely wasn't the case a few months ago. And even with those leaning in, the level of improvement and AI Iearning will be slow at times. This is why it’s critical for the CEO and the rest of management to be all-in and consistently participate in staff training sessions to show direction, intention and support. It’s very easy for the novelty of AI training to wear off after the first few months. This is where the AI task force can be instrumental to help maintain overall staff interest and keep engagement levels as high as possible. "Finally, we have some direction." — Kate Yordi, director of marketing, Visit Mesa Phase 3: AI Policy & Investments Developing an official AI policy and governance manual accomplishes two primary objectives: It protects the organization against legal and financial liability by establishing how all employees are required to use AI responsibly. It encourages and gives license for staff to proactively experiment with AI because there are clear guidelines in place about how to do so. There are many DMOs who have created AI policies and are willing to share with the rest of the industry. These are typically not lengthy documents (3-4 pages) nor full of legalese. Generally they’re written so every single employee can understand everything in them. Sections in these policies often include: Positioning/Purpose Statement: Expresses how and why the organization needs to be intentional about implementing AI processes Primary Objectives and Intended Outcomes: Defines the business case for how the organization is attempting to deliver on its core mandate of driving revenue to local businesses in alignment with community priorities Guiding Principles: Establishes the principles of responsible AI use in alignment with the values of the organizations related to themes such as inclusivity, bias, authenticity, veracity, collaboration, knowledge sharing, etc. AI Definitions: Provides clear explanations of AI terminology used in the document and workplace AI Tools: Identifies specific AI models that the organization provides access to Data Input: Dictates clear rules about what employees can upload into AI models and what they can’t upload, such as personal information of any person Monitoring: Defines how the organization reserves the right to monitor AI practices Training & Support: Defines opportunities for professional growth and learning AI on an ongoing basis There are other items that DMOs might include in the above list, and they vary depending on how HR, financial and legal departments interpret AI governance, but it serves as a foundation. One key consideration for DMO leadership when it comes to policy is identifying which pro AI models to invest in. Paid AI tools provide higher levels of privacy and security because AI companies don’t train on them, or at least there’s the choice to select that option. Many DMOs, for example, purchase annual subscriptions for paid ChatGPT Team accounts ($25 per employee monthly) for staff to use for work, which is a first step for protecting the IP and other interests of the organization. Other paid AI models are then provided to specific departments based on need and the specific attributes of the tools, such as Claude for marketing and social media staff because many consider it the best AI for content creation. Phase 4: AI Education & Implementation This is the most important thing in training teams to embrace and use AI effectively. You want to foster an environment where structured learning evolves into self-learning. That’s the only way this scales. When staff members with little experience in AI start exploring how to use AI on their own, and they start helping their colleagues see new ways to use AI, that’s a pretty special thing. From an education standpoint, the DMO AI Roadmap begins at a high level defining AI’s place in online history. AI is the third transformational shift since the PC was invented, including: The mainstream web/internet in the 1990s; the evolution of mobile/social/cloud and apps in the 2000s; and gen AI in the 2020s. These are the only three times when big tech went all-in and pivoted their business models around a new technology. I then break AI training into the following buckets, and again, this is all very surface level and not meant to be comprehensive. Also, creating engaging demos are everything, and that's not also easy because AI demos can be a real slog sometimes. But, showing how different AIs provide real value is key for people to internalize their learning and use it more intuitively over time: Explain how pre-gen AI tech is deterministic and gen AI is probabilistic, which messes with a lot of people’s minds. Gen AI outputs are based on statistical patterns and probabilities, just like the human brain processes ideas and information. Traditional tech is based on absolutes, delivering the same output based on the same input. Old tech is about information. AI is about knowledge. Spend a lot of time on this with workshops and demos. Highlight the capabilities of only three AI models to start: ChatGPT for brainstorming and planning; Claude for writing and data analysis; and Perplexity for conversational search. The other two, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, are more general purpose. They also do amazing things (Gemini 2.5 Pro is great for reasoning), but focusing on the first three will provide direction at the beginning so people don’t get overwhelmed. At the very minimum, leadership should have a basic understanding of those three. Explain how AI search isn't 100% perfect but it's a 1,000% better than old search. Define how DMOs and all brnads are redesigning their websites and content strategy to optimize for AI search, and the basics of AI SEO . I would argue the most important thing for using AI is really understanding how generative AI = conversational AI. It's a dialogue. It's called "chat" for a reason. This is where I’ve heard the most positive feedback from teams I’ve worked with. It happens when people move beyond the Google mindset—where search is one and done—and they see the real value of iterative conversations with AI models that evolve with each exchange in the discussion, just like a human conversation. This also removes some misperceptions about how to prompt. Yes, there are some basic rules about how to prompt well. But beyond that, it’s vastly more beneficial to explore AI conversations further with thoughtful follow-up prompts that flow logically and organically to achieve the best results. Explore how the real value of AI extends beyond just efficiency and productivity gains. That's a dangerous dialogue with staff who can construe that as leading to more work or being terminated over time. The bigger value and better narrative is how AI increases creativity and knowledge, and how those both influence overall quality of work, marketing effectiveness, sales productivity, staff culture and pride, job satisfaction and growth opportunities, etc. Really dig into the advanced features of the paid models: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro. Aside from the added security and privacy they provide, they offer functions not available in the free models and their outputs are significantly better. ChatGPT Projects and custom GPTs, Claude Projects and Perplexity Spaces are where the magic happens. Create an environment where staff members are eager to share their successes with AI with the rest of the organization. This feedback loop is critical for steering education and driving adoption, and it’s one of the most important roles for the internal AI task force. AI-training meetings can be highly effective during video calls but they often have the greatest impact during in-person workshops. Also, make sure to give staff a specific amount of hours during the week to develop their AI skills. Explore options for AI chat platforms and the benefits they provide for visitors and local industry partners. I work with Matador Network, which developed the industry leading GuideGeek AI chat platform. The feedback from 35+ DMO clients is impressive and irrefutable, but there is still much work to do educating visitors and industry about AI chat strategy and their benefits to continually increase adoption and business outcomes. The DMO AI Roadmap also provides guidance for developing various learning and engagement formats: Schedule weekly or bi-weekly meetings specifically, and only, for AI training with both internal and external people sharing insights Create a library of AI educational materials for staff to reference Start a weekly internal AI newsletter to share how teams are using AI Start a Slack or similar channel dedicated for AI education, AI news updates, knowledge sharing, etc Start a weekly and optional one-hour AMA meeting for everyone to ask everyone else questions (highly effective) Create a regular schedule for staff to report back to leadership or department heads about how they’re using AI and what they’re achieving with it Phase 5: Success Tracking I kick off every AI presentation identifying the three AI models mentioned above—ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity—followed by the assertion that, "AI is the death of 'I don't know.'" That is arguably the biggest ROI for integrating AI in a DMO or any other type of organization. There are few questions that are too complex or too intimidating for DMO staff to approach with confidence and conviction if they know how to use those three AI models effectively. I shared an example previously where I used Perplexity Pro to educate myself about how board governance is evolving . That for me was something I knew was out of my realm of expertise, but now I feel I can speak with some semblance of authority about that to any board because of AI. Before gen AI, I dismissed board governance as one of those things I'd just have to leave in the dark. That said, trying to explain how AI helps staff become more self-reliant, where they can always build a foundation of understanding for anything to empower themselves, only goes so far with a board. They're looking for more quantitative KPIs. Here are just some examples of that in a DMO context. In 2025, defining KPIs for AI integration is an evolving science, and we as an industry are still figuring a lot of this out. Therefore, this list is nowhere near comprehensive and it will evolve, but we have ample data today to validate the following: Using AI for search and content development saves significant time and increases opportunities for higher output and increased creativity for producing blog posts, social media, videos, marketing campaigns, etc. Developing custom GPTs (in ChatGPT Plus) for group sales is a proven strategy for creating better, more customized proposals in much less time. That gives sales staff more time for brainstorming and prospecting leading to higher production. That's a fact. In this case, group sales people are actually pumped to try a new technology. Using AI for regression analysis and scenario modeling increases the accuracy of how DMOs predict visitor volumes year-round, event attendance, economic impact, etc. One of the biggest conversations in DMOs today is how to develop content and websites to rank higher in AI search. Developing best practices in AI SEO leads to higher traffic. That is a core mandate for any DMO, and no DMO can afford to ignore that over time. AI chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI are driving real business. As described in PhocusWire in March, New York City Tourism + Conventions launched its GuideGeek-powered "Ellis" meeting-specific AI chat in January. ROI to date: 100% increase in traffic to the meeting planner website, 800+ AI-driven queries in the first month, 50% growth in newsletter sign-ups, and 10% increase in time spent on the site. Summary The AI train has left the station and it's gaining steam. The DMO AI Roadmap is the next logical step for helping DMO CEOs and their teams integrate AI processes and platforms. As Visit Mesa's Kate Yordi said, "Finally, we now have direction." That's a big deal for DMO staff to feel that way. Generative AI has been with us for more than two years now, but a structured and phased approach for integrating AI across DMO departments has been the missing piece. Visit Mesa's DMO AI Roadmap is going to evolve as the team works through the process, but at least now there's a vision and scope. Visit Mesa CEO Marc Garcia and the board are fully committed—a critical first step for embarking on this journey. Also, this strategic framework for how DMOs approach AI is going to underpin the interactive AI Playground activation at U.S. Travel's upcoming ESTO conference in Phoenix, August 17-19. U.S. Travel and GuideGeek are partnering to develop educational programming for the hands-on AI training experience and series of thought leadership. Greg Oates

How AI Improves DMO and Community Master Planning Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Many DMOs are developing 10-year destination master plans to optimize their visitor economy in alignment with local community priorities. I've participated in producing dozens of them from Miami to Mesa. They often take as long as a year to complete because there's so much focus on community engagement in various formats: interviews, focus groups, town halls, surveys, visioning sessions, etc. The tourism industry talks about the importance of community a LOT. However, when you're working with a DMO, you never really dig into what actually moves the needle across so many endless community demands, not on a tactical and hyperlocal level. You're not really held accountable for any measure of success when it comes to community-specific initiatives, ranging from improving City Hall permitting processes for small businesses to tracking the movement of unhoused. A master plan needs to address those and amplify those kinds of pressing needs for the destination overall. The expectation is not really to fix them. That’s not the role of a DMO. It's a whole different ballgame when you're developing a long-term strategic framework for a community organization like Near Southside, Inc . in Fort Worth. Success and being accountable for fixing things is expected. Located at the periphery of the downtown core, Near Southside is the most interesting community in North America right now. The ex-industrial district can be loosely compared to Austin 20 years ago with the same cultural DNA and similar community values, based on a fiercely protective love for local, creative and independently owned small businesses. That's under threat. In the last few years, as Near Southside evolved into the coolest 'hood east and west of the Pecos Line, real estate prices are rising commensurately. We all know how this story often ends with the encroachment of national brands sanitizing the soul of a place that made it attractive in the first place. Near Southside is intent on rewriting that story. AI Processes for Strategic Planning Here's where AI comes in. Because of the multitude of overlapping challenges and evolving dynamics in the community, our team needs to crunch and debate a ton of qualitative and quantitative data. Addressing gentrification touches on so many aspects of how communities operate. Therefore, we are over-indexing on community engagement to get as many perspectives as possible to identify how the community best evolves in the face of rapid change. The amount of inputs we're getting is substantive, and we want to inventory all of it as thoroughly as possible to build a super comprehensive knowledge base for the AI to cull through, connect dots and output insights. Every individual zoom call with stakeholders is recorded with Granola AI, which produces full transcripts but the summaries are too light. So we created custom GPTs with instructions for everything we want in the summaries, including comprehensive overviews, key takeaways with detailed context for each, the most insightful quotes related to those takeaways, and all action items that stakeholders recommended. With the GPT, we can fire full transcripts into the chat, press "enter" and receive highly valuable, high quality and uniform summaries almost immediately. We're doing the same with the focus groups but the custom GPTs require a different set of instructions. The two-hour transcripts capture the conversations with 10-20 stakeholders convened across specific industry and community segments. For those, the GPTs bucket corresponding high-level takeaways and tactical action items related to the same theme. That has immeasurable value because these conversations are all over the place. It's great working with locals who are so passionate about where they live and how, but that means you're getting feedback from a firehose and someone taking notes doesn’t capture all the nuance. Using custom GPTs to produce these summaries and populate takeaways is as good or better than any team could do manually. Everything is stored in Airtable. Forget Google or Microsoft cloud platforms. Airtable is an AI-powered, relational database/spreadsheet beast for organizing data and automating basic workflows. The tables combine all project information in one place, such as a running list of pending/completed interviews and focus groups and their AI-generated summaries. Airtable can then auto-generate a summary of the summary in the same table for clients to easily review everything being collected on a daily basis to whatever degree they prefer. Once you use Airtable, you'll never look at Google Drive the same way again. I've never had so many insights so well organized, so thorough and so easy to share with a team and client to help inform each project phase. The client loves the transparency, immediacy and structure, naturally, versus waiting for the next weekly update to read a few bullet points in a PowerPoint. Here's the thing. Because we've been so intentional about collecting such a high quality and comprehensive volume of feedback, we have a motherlode of a knowledge base for AI to work with. We can then enter all that in bulk into Google NotebookLM or ChatGPT/Claude Projects to pull out anything from high-level aggregate takeaways to anything super customized or tactical. For example, the client was interested in hearing specifically just what developers had to say about gentrification. I wanted highlights related to anything discussed regarding City Hall processes. It’s super easy to pull reports together for those and anything else. Ultimately, you can use AI to deliver an outline, a strategy map and a very rough draft of a destination master plan. All you need to do is combine all of the above together, plus PDFs of all relevant public and private planning documents, PDFs of all relevant case studies and best practices, and detailed instructions about the purpose, elements, structure, etc., of the plan. People will disagree, sure. I'm not dismissing the expertise of people who put these things together, because they bring deep context to every conversation and decision made during the development of a master plan. Everything happening now in Near Southside has happened somewhere else. When you can bring takeaways from those places to any present situation, it helps provide direction for everyone in the room. Again, I’m not saying that AI is replacing humans. People get all kinds of worked up over that, especially in travel and tourism. I am saying you can create a better, more strategic and more informed master plan in a much more streamlined fashion when you employ AI strategically to better prepare a community for the future. That's just a fact. I have four more community focus groups today in Near Southside. The expectation among everyone is that their contributions will make a demonstrable difference in their neighborhood. We can’t just speak to the challenges. We need to fix them and our processes with AI are giving everyone more confidence that we can deliver on that. Wondering how many DMOs are interested in employing similar AI-first strategies to get a better handle on how to help their communities. Greg Oates

How Visit Richmond is Using AI to Sell More Conventions Aug 2 Written By Greg Oates DMO CEOs want specific use cases for AI showing how they drive measurable business results. Here's a great example for capitalizing on AI to drive meetings and conventions volume from Lauran Peoples , director of sales marketing and business development at Visit Richmond in Virginia. Peoples works in the organization's 13-person sales team and reports to the VP of sales. Her role has three core functions: She is the main liaison between the destination sales and marketing departments; she develops and leads campaign strategy for the sales department; and she works with her colleagues to optimize strategic partnerships. Peoples' role is somewhat unique as a liaison between sales and marketing in that she lives on the sales side, versus marketing. She also stands out in our industry as an emerging voice in AI innovation. If you're going to U.S. Travel's ESTO conference this month in Phoenix, look for her and me working in the show's inaugural AI Playground educational activation. Greg Oates: Can you explain your role at Visit Richmond, specifically in terms of how you bridge the sales and marketing teams? Lauran Peoples: It's becoming more common in DMOs for sales teams to have a marketing liaison, but usually that person is based on the marketing team and is mostly assigned to sales to help with creative. The issue is when that marketing liaison is based on the marketing team, they don't have much exposure to the field and what's happening out of market with your salespeople. Our sales team has 45 trade shows this upcoming fiscal year, so they're traveling almost every week. With my situation in Richmond, they're getting real-time data and downloads about what's happening in each destination, so that gives them more authentic conversations to engage planners. Not having someone assigned to a team like that creates a huge disconnect and leaves opportunity on the table. GO: Tell us a little about your journey with AI. LP: I've been working in hospitality for 20 years. Last year, I heard some younger people on the team talking about ChatGPT. So I was like, okay, I don't know anything about that. I went to PCMA Convening Leaders in January and the opening session was all about AI. I remember sitting there feeling like a dinosaur. Feeling very behind. I realized this is a lot more serious and widespread than I thought, so I left and tasked myself with using ChatGPT once a day. Initially, I couldn't differentiate how it wasn't like Google. I was asking it how many tablespoons are in this or that, kind of thing. Since then, my understanding of AI has progressively increased around more complex and comprehensive capabilities. It has streamlined my productivity, but more importantly, AI has become a thought partner for me to bounce all these ideas and scenarios around that I didn't have before. I think that a lot of people are adopting AI and using it as a communications assistant, or a writing assistant. But the part for me that's really exciting and valuable with AI is analyzing and aggregating data and getting it to show you things that you need help with, like sales. GO: Can you share an example? LP: Sure. I took five datasets: five years of lost business, five years of definite business, and three marketing reports from different campaigns we were running with outside agencies like Sojourn and Digital Edge. Those campaigns give us demographic insights because we were targeting certain areas. I also grabbed our sales deployment sheet, which tells you who has what market. I uploaded all of those into ChatGPT and asked it to identify the top five locations for each of our managers based on their market segments. Some results weren't surprising, but there were a few that popped up like Orlando that we've never traditionally considered. When I asked ChatGPT why Orlando, it showed how the city has a large hobby market. It turns out there are a lot of hobby conventions that meet in Orlando. After I compiled the top five locations for each manager, I asked ChatGPT to give me the top five accounts in each of those locations. Then I asked for unique selling propositions for each of those accounts as to why Richmond would be a perfect fit. Finally, I asked it to rank those five destinations based on probability of success. GO: Have you seen any of this result in new business opportunities? LP: Yes. One location that showed up was Philadelphia. Richmond is four hours from Philadelphia, but like Orlando it hasn't typically been on our radar. However, based on the data from ChatGPT, Philly came up as a recommendation. So we sent one of our sales managers to Philadelphia, and she ended up hosting 18 planners, including some who drove from over an hour away to see her. She got such a great response that I had to jump in and go with her because she couldn't host 18 clients by herself. AI has now informed our sales strategy for Philly, and the region is now part of our dedicated sales strategy. We've allocated funds for that sales manager in Philly to join chapters of organizations like MPI and PCMA. So that's how we know there had to be some accuracy to our approach with AI. GO: How do the sales managers feel about you doing this AI analysis? LP: They appreciate it. It's a balance because most sales managers at DMOs aren't entry level; they've been in hospitality for a long time. This is a new process and a new tool for them. Some have destinations they like to go to over and over because they're successful there. But my role is to support business enablement and sales enablement to help them do what they do better and uncover new business. So how we're using AI provides them with additional actionable research. GO: I think one of the most underrated strategies for AI is developing custom GPTs in ChatGPT to help sales teams develop more customized and effective proposals more quickly. Are you building those at all? LP: Yes, definitely. About a month and a half ago, I programmed a GPT for the sales team called "Prospecting Partner." It's trained on our sales collateral and all our information, so it knows our convention packages and understands our jurisdiction and seven localities. The sales managers have been using it to prospect smarter. I included suggested prompts to go beyond just, "Give me a prospecting email." We can get really specific, like, "Help me re-engage an association planner who just lost grant funding." It also provides strategies specifically related to that, and then you can ask how to execute those strategies. So, for example, we know from reports that finance and insurance is an opportunity market for us. It's a small percentage of our current business but it has the highest average daily rate, which makes it very attractive to our hotel partners. So our salespeople are asking ChatGPT for ways we can develop business in the finance and insurance market, and really dig into that. Ultimately, AI is helping our sales team think bigger, smarter and more strategically. I've asked the sales team if they found this helpful, and, you know, salespeople are not an easy crowd. They said yes across the board. With the ChatGPT Enterprise version, I can't see their exact prompts due to privacy, but I can see the number of conversations they're having with the tool, so I know they're actively using it. GO: How are other people on your team using AI? LP: My two direct reports are our CRM database administrator and our sales coordinator. My sales coordinator does support work for the entire team, so she's using ChatGPT a lot for ideation, like when a sales manager needs an itinerary to entertain clients in Chicago. My CRM database administrator uses ChatGPT as a communication assistant because sometimes analytical personality types can benefit from exploring more communication nuances. She's also started incorporating it into data cleanup, using it to analyze reports and suggest what's missing or what would be beneficial. She uses it to help fill in gaps and identify what's not being asked or said. GO: What are some of your future plans with AI? LP: We're launching microsites for destination sales and sports, and I think it will set a model for the rest of the organization because we’re replacing our website from pre- to post-AI, like most DMO sites these days. We're currently writing copy for the microsites, and I've been getting into structured data and semantic clarity. You don't search ChatGPT or prompt ChatGPT with the same language you search Google, so content has to be written differently. Previously, you'd go to Google and say "restaurants near me." Now with ChatGPT, it's more of a conversation, so you'll say, "Hey, I'm in Scott's Addition historic district in Richmond with my kids, and we're looking for a vegan restaurant." That semantic clarity allows AI to respond with much more specific answers. I think we need to anticipate AI searches, as opposed to Google searches, in how we write content. Everyone is subconsciously expecting a personally curated experience today. When I go on Amazon, I'm expecting it to make connections that I like this, so I might also like this, without me having to tell it certain things. That's where we have to move towards, or we get eclipsed or become obsolete, especially if we're just thinking of ourselves as brokers for a destination. Greg Oates

Visit Phoenix CEO on Leading AI Strategy and Being Chill About It Jul 28 Written By Greg Oates I learned a lot about how DMO leaders can confidently integrate AI processes into their organizations after speaking with Ron Price, CDME, president and CEO of Visit Phoenix. Price is somewhat new to AI but his staff have been doing cool things with various LLMs for a while. He says his primary role with AI is providing the Visit Phoenix team with an enabling environment for success built on a culture of trust. Price accomplishes that by inspiring everyone to experiment with AI, be aware of the liabilities, share their wins, have fun with it, reach out to others for advice, and most of all, validate everything. Although, what stood out for me the most talking with Price is his calm and clear approach to AI, basically inferring (in my words, not his)... "We got this. We might do something amazing today with AI or we might not, but either way we're fully committed to seeing what it can do. We're also going to figure this AI thing out by collaborating with our many DMO industry friends. Because AI is going to change everything in a hurry, and we at Visit Phoenix are not going to be caught staring out at a Sonoran sunset while the world passes our city by." That's the vibe I got. That's leadership. That's what being a CEO means, at least for me. AI is confusing, sure, and CEOs have to worry about their boards and electeds. The thing is, we're more than two and a half years into generative AI now, and it's not going to wait for CEOs to decide if they can "trust AI" or not. I think we can all learn from Price a few things: We can de-escalate all the hubris and hand-wringing surrounding AI by being open to possibilities and having a clear set of principles, especially related to responsible AI use and verification. You can have fun with AI and focus on business outcomes at the same time. The DMO industry needs to collaborate and share best practices more intentionally to accelerate AI education, innovation and integration. We must encourage DMO staff to use AI today so they can steer the future of our industry tomorrow. Price likes talking about AI. I would encourage any DMO CEOs on the fence with AI to reach out to him. Greg Oates: Ron, how do you use AI? Ron Price: I use AI every single day, going back now about a month and a half. I'm just fascinated and interested in what it's able to do. I wouldn't say I'm an early adopter, of course, although there are some people who aren't even on it yet. Me personally, I use it for everything, like if I'm curious about something that's happening within the region. Or maybe I want to quickly compile a lot of data to help solve a problem or answer questions as I get ready for different meetings. More or less, my brain is always just firing, like, "What if we tried this or that?" And so, this year has been a cool realization about what AI can do, and seeing how it's pulling all the sources through to validate what it responds with. We have also integrated AI with Microsoft Copilot. We pay for everyone to have access to that, and then we also have a ChatGPT Team account for our staff. GO: Where else are you seeing value with AI at Visit Phoenix? RP: In our world, it's marketing, it's content. I love being surrounded by people who can write really well. It's an art to me, and I don't possess that art. It's like someone playing the piano. I'm in awe of that. So AI gives people the ability to write better, and it's okay to lean into it. Don't feel threatened by it. AI is able to give you that one golden nugget, or it suggests that one good idea that can really help someone when they're writing. Here's the fun part. Every day, we're learning something unique. We have the Cronkite School of Journalism in Phoenix, and some of the students are here. We kind of give them free rein, and we're also teaching them at the same time. The way that they use AI is amazing. It's fun to walk down the hall to see them because I'm always like, "How did you write that? How did you create that image? How did you pull that data and research together?" It's just a different generation. We're also seeing where our people are asking AI things like, "If I'm a salesperson, how do I influence a group to come here in the middle of the summer for a conference? Why is it fun to be here for a conference when it's 110 degrees out?" And what does AI have to say? Well, one thing that's great about, say, Grok, for example, it's pulling from all these little texts on Twitter, or X. They're from people saying, "Hey, I know it's summertime in Phoenix but look what I got to do." Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use. GO: Does your staff using AI increase your organization's impact in the community? RP: We not only focus on growing tourism in our community, but we're also joined at the hip with economic development. We look at our role as we're here to build a better community through tourism. And so, when you think about utilizing all the data out there, we always ask ourselves, "How could AI help us consolidate that data and crunch the numbers faster to give us a clearer picture of what we think we know?" For example, how much business that comes in through our leads touch our priority sectors? And of those sectors, which ones align extremely well with what we're doing here at Visit Phoenix? Is it semiconductors? Is it bio-med? Is it something that leans into the engineering side because of what ASU and the Department of Defense are doing? We've seen we can go back and look at the data and get a better picture of those things now. Also, as an example, we have a high propensity to book business around the semiconductor space. So we're utilizing these AI tools to quickly do research like, "Give me a list of the top semiconductor conferences that take place around the world." The responses are quicker and the results are better versus doing a traditional Google search. It's able to pull from a lot of different sources, so that's another way we're using AI. “Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use.” GO: How do you define the role of a CEO to guide a DMO forward with AI? RP: Setting up the rules of the game is important. There are areas of liability we have to be aware of about what you can and can't be pulling in. Those are the types of things we needed to figure out, you know, basically, "What is our rule book for using AI?" I like giving people the ability to use AI as they will. I think it works best whenever people know that it's a tool we want them to utilize. And if it can help us at the end of the day tell a better story, be smarter as we go after business, and be smarter with our analytics to help build our marketing strategy stronger, then use it. I try to build a team of leaders so they're CEOs of their own divisions, and I want them to be thought leaders in their areas. Also, I think AI enables us to get to answers quickly, but, and this is important, how do we validate those answers? We're really good at Visit Phoenix when it comes to validating answers, but we're usually doing it by going the long way and understanding how AI responded like it did. We're reading source by source by source, and then we kind of come to our own conclusion. It's like we're not just focused on the punch line of a joke. We can also tell you the structure of the joke. You always have to validate. We get excited about using AI because it just puts us in a new position. I think it's good to have a CEO that supports that, but that support comes from a trust within the organization. I trust that people are going to utilize AI to help make us better. GO: What keeps you up at night regarding AI? RP: My fear is how do we control and ensure that someone isn't producing something negative on our behalf, and then launching it to the world, and using this incredible tool to hurt us? Because there are people that are extremely gullible who believe whatever they're looking at. That's kind of where my brain goes sometimes. It's only because of what I've already seen these tools can do. I think across the DMO industry, we'll have some "ahas," especially when we get together in various forums to exchange ideas. We need to be talking with each other about, "Here are some things that work really well with AI, and here are the headwinds." And then, "These are the things you need to realize could happen with AI, and here are some ways you can mitigate those problems." The more we can learn from others about how they're using AI, the better. I think what you're putting together about AI strategy with all your insights is going to be extremely valuable. GO: Thank you. So, what are you thinking about next with AI? RP: As AI continues to grow, and we've talked about it here internally, what is the value of a website? In fact, we just started our next fiscal year, July 1. Website visits is no longer a key metric that we're going after. As a leader, I like knowing what's three steps ahead. We currently have these tools, but how are they going to change the way we make decisions going forward? At some point, a lot of what we're talking about now is going to be white noise. And what then? It doesn't mean our jobs of promoting a destination change. It means we're going to get so much better at telling our story through so many different avenues. I believe that our reach is actually going to broaden. We're still going to be responsible for promoting our destination and selling our destination, but how we tell the story and how we show the story is going to change as these tools evolve. Back in the day, a lot of us were reading about Moore's Law and how things just keep improving and getting cheaper, especially in technology. Now we're moving into a space where the rate of growth with AI is going to be something we've never seen before. Greg Oates

German Convention Bureau Leader on the Future of AI-Powered Meetings Jul 27 Written By Greg Oates After the global financial crisis ended in 2011, a few cities and nations around the world began promoting themselves to meeting and convention organizers based on their intellectual capital, versus venues and attractions. Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau (GCB), led this strategy in Europe at the time. Around the same year, I was visiting the House of Logistics & Mobility (HOLM) think tank in Frankfurt. The GCB suggested I visit there to better understand this new direction for attracting high-value business events in advanced industries. "The city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," Dr. Stefan Walter told me, who was a professor at HOLM at the time. "So, this [GCB] strategy is about finding the strengths of our strengths, our core competencies, and for Germany, that’s knowledge and infrastructure. It’s also about connecting ideas.” That has been my due north working in the travel industry ever since. This idea that meeting planners and attendees can tap into a deep knowledge base in a host destination, specific to their interests, for me, is intoxicating. The challenge is it takes a ton of work connecting local leaders in specific advanced industries, like aviation in Frankfurt or e-mobility in Stuttgart, with large global organizations in those same industries and convince them to bring their big annual event to Germany. It's also pretty high level. From an attendee standpoint, if I'm in Hamburg and want to learn about HafenCity, the largest urban makeover in Europe, it's not like I can easily access a bunch of people and organizations leading the future of urban development. Which, would be cool, right? AI is helping make that a reality. Germany's national Open Data/Knowledge Graph project is an ambitious AI-powered initiative to build a massive network of industry suppliers, academic organizations and business leaders across the country. Basically, by indexing the visitor industry and intellectual capital supply chain, Germany can connect the brightest minds in Germany with the rest of the world more seamlessly, effectively and equitably. An "interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," if you will. I spoke with Mr. Schultze to learn more about how AI is impacting the meetings and convention industry in Germany. Greg Oates: How is AI evolving across Germany's visitor industry? Specifically, how are your municipal CVBs and other partners thinking about and using AI right now? Matthias Schultze: Like much of the world, things really accelerated for us around two years ago with the rise of tools like ChatGPT. Suddenly, everyone, from corporates to associations, started thinking seriously about AI. We saw an opportunity and created an innovation platform called ebx.lab . It’s a peer-to-peer learning community for event planners, where we partner with scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute to explore how AI might reshape the business events space. From those early sessions, we have published a few white papers and identified a few core insights. AI clearly has potential to personalize experiences, optimize event planning processes, improve engagement and networking, and maybe most exciting, support predictive analytics. That last one, especially, being able to anticipate trends or behaviors based on data, is what feels most transformative to me personally. GO: How is the GCB embracing AI internally? MS: We developed our own internal AI strategy for the German Convention Bureau. We wanted to give both our team and our stakeholders a shared framework, something that outlined where we are today, where we want to go, and how we get there. It’s called "Driven by People, Powered by Data," and that title really reflects our belief that AI is a tool, not a solution in itself. People need to lead the process. The strategy helps us clarify not just what we can do with AI, but also what we can’t or shouldn’t do, at least not yet. It outlines our roadmap and aligns everyone across our organization and membership. GO: Is that strategy available publicly? MS: Yes, though only in German for now. But with the right AI tools, you can translate it quickly. The strategy touches on everything from marketing and communications to event planning, workflow automation, customer personalization, sustainability, and even ethics and compliance. The ethics component is particularly important. As exciting as AI is, we have to keep guardrails in place. Within our organization, we’re working hard to ensure that AI isn’t something siloed or limited to leadership. It needs to be embedded across every level. Everyone in the organization is expected to develop basic AI literacy. We’ve also worked on minimum viable products for things like dashboards and customer-facing chatbots. Some are already in use today. GO: You've always been a strong and vocal proponent for sustainability in business events. How is AI supporting you there? MS: I’m very proud of a project we developed with 29 other European countries: the Sustainability Hub for Events . It’s an AI-driven platform that brings together all kinds of sustainability related data—certifications, guidelines, best practices—and makes them accessible through an interactive AI agent. Planners can ask things like, “Can you help me build a sustainable menu?” or input event details to estimate their CO₂ footprint. It’s highly practical, and it’s making a real difference for event planners who need fast, reliable and actionable sustainability information. GO: We've talked about your Open Data and Knowledge Graph project in Germany numerous times in the past. Is that now live? MS: It’s technically live but still in progress, and probably always will be, in a sense. We’re continuously expanding it. The Open Data Germany project by the German National Tourist Board is live with its Knowledge Graph. The Open Data MICE project, which is implemented in close cooperation with the GNTB, is not yet live. One exciting element launching soon is an interactive map of research institutions in Germany. It will show where key research and innovation is taking place, including medical tech, renewable energy and so on, and link that data to infrastructure like hotels and conference venues. The idea is to visualize Germany as a knowledge landscape. If you’re planning an event and you want to anchor it around a theme like urban mobility, the map will show you which regions are most active in that field and match you with the relevant venues and experts. GO: One theme I keep obsessing about, and it's felt like a bit of a fantasy for more than a decade, is that the city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine. That idea is a direct quote from your House of Logistics and Mobility in Frankfurt, and it’s stuck with me ever since I heard it back in 2011. It's this idea of a city as a platform. Do you think we're getting closer to executing on this idea, where innovation at all levels is more accessible and shareable for more people? Ultimately what we're talking about here is the democratization of knowledge and excellence. MS: I love that idea. I really do. I think there are two layers to it. On one level, we have the smart city movement with systems that integrate transportation, energy, data and infrastructure to make better decisions. That’s already happening in many places across Europe. But on a deeper level, regarding your fantasy.... Let's say you could land in Munich, be interested in urban tech, and immediately connect with people, events and institutions aligned with that interest—that’s becoming possible too. The data already exists. It’s just scattered. But with open data standards, machine readability, and the right AI tools, we can start connecting those dots. Your fantasy city may not be so far off.

A CEO's Playbook for AI Integration Oct 10 Written By Greg Oates Your competitors are talking about AI. Your board is asking about AI. Your partners want to see your AI strategy. Many DMOs are debating the potential of AI, while an increasing number of others are already extracting real business and organizational value. The difference isn't budget or technical talent. It's knowing exactly where to look for opportunities and how to scale what works. 3 Non-Negotiables You Must Lead This, Not Delegate It: AI transformation dies in committee. The organizations seeing real results have CEOs who champion specific initiatives, remove bureaucratic friction, and signal that AI adoption is a strategic priority. This doesn't mean micromanaging prompts. It means creating air cover for teams to experiment and fail fast. Complex Impresses, Simple Delivers: Your instinct will be to pursue the flashy, sophisticated AI applications that sound impressive in board presentations. Resist it. The organizations generating real ROI start with mundane problems: expense report processing, meeting summarization, competitive monitoring, etc. These boring use cases build organizational confidence and create the foundation for more ambitious projects. Your People Know Where the Problems Are: The best AI applications emerge from the intersection of daily frustration and technological possibility. Run hackathons. Create cross-functional workshops. Ask your teams what they do that feels like waste. The solutions they surface will be more practical and impactful than anything your consultants recommend. Start Here Stop looking for AI opportunities everywhere. Focus your organization's attention on three specific areas where AI creates immediate, measurable value. The Tedium Tax: Every role in your organization includes mind-numbing tasks that consume time without creating value: data entry, compliance documentation, procurement reports, staff vacation tracking, etc. Think of these as your "Anti To-Do List." These are tasks systematically eliminated by asking, "How can I never have to do this again?" Your teams are paying a tedium tax every day. AI is the refund. The Expertise Bottleneck: Projects stall when teams hit the limits of their skills and wait for other departments. Marketing needs data analysis and campaign design mockups. Finance and HR need custom GPTs. Sales needs meetings-related technical specifications translated into customer language. AI breaks these bottlenecks by giving every team superpowers they never had before. The Blank Page Problem: Knowledge work involves ambiguous challenges where the path forward isn't clear: Strategy development, market analysis, problem diagnosis, etc. AI excels at generating multiple approaches, analyzing incomplete information, and proposing next steps when your teams are stuck. It's the thinking partner that's always available and never runs out of ideas. 6 Use Cases OpenAI's analysis of 600+ successful implementations across various industries reveals that virtually every valuable AI application falls into one of six categories. Show your teams these six use cases and they'll start finding opportunities everywhere. Content Creation: Use AI for first drafts of everything: strategy documents, marketing campaigns, product and experience descriptions, customer and community communications. AI maintains your brand voice while eliminating the blank page problem. Research and Synthesis: AI powers information gathering at superhuman speed, including market analysis, competitive intelligence, customer feedback synthesis, regulatory research, etc.. AI doesn't just find information. It structures it exactly how you need it for decision-making. Coding for Everyone: Your non-technical teams can now write Python scripts, SQL queries, and data visualizations. Your engineering teams debug faster and prototype in unfamiliar languages. AI democratizes technical capability while accelerating your experts. Data Analysis Without Degrees: Upload spreadsheets, dashboard screenshots or raw data files and get structured analysis without requiring PhD-level statistics knowledge. This is arguably the most undervalued opportunity that delivers immediate results for most DMOs. Strategic Thinking Partner: AI is a beast for brainstorming, scenario planning, product and event development, asset mapping, risk analysis, etc. AI helps structure complex problems and identifies considerations your teams might miss. This is my favorite use case for AI. Intelligent Automation: Use platforms like n8n, Relay and others to create repeatable processes that run themselves, such as weekly competitive updates, financial reporting, sales and marketing workflows, a ton of admin duties, etc. Create the process once, then let AI handle the execution while humans focus on exceptions and strategy. Implementation is Where DMOs Fail Most AI initiatives fail because organizations treat them like traditional software deployments. They're not. AI is about change management and behavioral transformation up and down the org chart. AI implementation requires different approaches to discovery, prioritization and scaling. Systematic Opportunity Hunting: Don't wait for AI use cases to emerge organically. Run structured discovery sessions where teams audit their workflows for repetitive tasks, skill bottlenecks, and ambiguous challenges. Make this process ongoing, not a one-time exercise. The Impact-Effort Matrix: Not every AI opportunity deserves attention. Prioritize based on business impact versus implementation effort. Quick wins build momentum. High-value, high-effort projects become strategic investments. Everything else gets parked until technology makes it easier. Innovation as Culture: Internal competitions accelerate discovery while building AI literacy across your organization. The goal isn't technical sophistication. It's practical business solutions that teams actually want to use. Measure What Matters: Track time saved, accuracy improved, costs reduced and capability expansion. But also measure qualitative impacts: employee satisfaction, process improvements, competitive advantages. Use this data to guide scaling decisions. Build Your AI Process Move beyond random experimentation to systematic capability building. I like Estée Lauder's 5-phase process to ensure repeatable success with AI. Does this resonate with you for your DMO? Design: Define your purpose, scope and success criteria for AI integration in a 2-page brief. No scope creep. No technical complexity for its own sake. Prepare: Ask department heads to gather relevant data and best practices. AI tools should reflect organizational knowledge, not generic approaches. Build and Test: Hire contractors where necessary to help teams develop automations/agents, implement training, integrate datasets and validate accuracy. Focus on usability, not just functionality. Launch: Deploy with user guides and change management support. Technology deployment is easy. User adoption across all departments is a total headache at first. Optimize: Feedback loops drive continuous improvement based on actual usage patterns. AI applications evolve with business needs and improved capabilities. Key Insight: Always start with fundamental questions: Why build this? What problem does it solve? What impact will it have? Is the measurement for success quantitative or qualitative? Organizations that answer these questions clearly will build more successful AI applications than those focused primarily on technical capability. Build AI-Native Workflows The most sophisticated implementations integrate AI across entire business processes rather than individual tasks. This evolution positions organizations for the agentic AI capabilities coming next. Process Decomposition: Break complex workflows into constituent tasks, identify where each AI use case category adds value, and create integrated approaches spanning from research through execution. Marketing workflows might integrate research for market understanding, analysis for opportunity mapping, ideation for strategy, content creation for product and destination development, and automation for distribution. Cross-Functional Integration: AI facilitates better collaboration by translating between departments. Technical specifications become marketing language. Customer requirements inform sales priorities. Financial models drive strategic planning. Future-Proofing for Agents: Current workflow integration prepares your organization for AI agents that can complete entire projects independently. Teams that understand how to break processes into AI-addressable components will leverage these capabilities immediately when available. The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done. This cognitive shift creates advantages that compound over time and become increasingly difficult for competitors to replicate. "The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done." Key Takeaways The question isn't whether AI will transform our industry. It's whether you'll be leading that transformation or reacting to it. Start with clear, achievable use cases and systemic approaches to build the organizational muscle needed for transformation. AI advantage isn't about having the most technical teams or biggest budgets. It's about developing capabilities for organization-wide discovery, adoption, implementation and scaling of practical business solutions. The organizations moving beyond experimentation to systematic implementation today will be best positioned to leverage the more sophisticated AI capabilities emerging tomorrow. The agents are coming. Will you be ready? Greg Oates

The ROI of AI Agents Aug 21 Written By Greg Oates Based on a bunch of conversations at DI Annual 2025 this month, it's clear that many DMO executives still equate generative AI primarily with writing and editing in ChatGPT. But as one COO of a large U.S. DMO told me, "Surely there's more to all this than just learning about prompting." So many ways to respond to that. Meanwhile, there are also DMO leaders who established AI road maps for their organizations going back two years. For them, they're increasingly focused on developing AI-powered automated workflows and their more sophisticated cousins, AI agents. The purpose of these synthetic workflows is to automate tedious, time-consuming and repetitive tasks to free up staff to focus on more high-value work. Think of it as an evolution from using AI to building AI. You begin by visually mapping what people do in your organization. Then you identify where AI can potentially take over all the mundane stuff better and faster. I’ve been working with my colleagues at Matador Network to develop automated workflows for our Studio team. We have endless terabytes of client video created during the last 10 years. Now, with AI, we want to capitalize on those existing assets to create new video, but first we need to use AI to understand what we actually own. We contracted Erick Bonilla , founder of Pocho.tech based in Uruguay, to build a series of new AI workflows in n8n. One of the automations is designed to cull through 10 years of video files in Dropbox and catalogue everything in Airtable. The AI then creates standardized file names, project IDs, links for raw edited videos and finished client hero/cutdown videos, and location and content tags. The cost to develop the AI workflow was about $2,000 all-in, and it saved more than a month of work at a mid-level manager salary. The beauty of automations/agents is you can measure ROI annually fairly easily, which will help wake up your board if they're sleeping on AI. Moreover, once an automation is in place, the savings will continue to accrue in the future indefinitely for tasks still required, and there’s zero human error. During a staff Zoom, I asked members of our Studio team if they felt these new agents signaled to them the beginning of the end of some people’s jobs. The response was unanimous. Nobody wants to do this type of repetitive grunt work. I spoke with Bonilla for his take on the future of AI agents. Greg Oates: Erick, what services does Pocho.tech provide? Erick Bonilla: We identify opportunities within organizations of all sizes, where we believe implementing AI systems can dramatically improve the efficiency of operations. We can create workflows that process data, or we can create AI agents capable of reasoning, analyzing data, creating reports, and providing decision-makers with an enhanced way of digesting information. I have been doing this for almost two years, working with people mostly in the Middle East, the US and Latin America. The Pocha company site is brand new as I try to expand in the world of AI. GO: What’s the difference between automated workflows and agents? EB: A workflow is like a mass production factory. It's a set of operations that work through specific logic to automate a repetitive process that a human has done before. This could be writing and reading emails, writing summaries, reformatting and transferring content through different tools and applications, etc. An AI agent is a thinking environment that makes decisions for you. You can set a workflow for reading your emails. But then you can have an AI agent that summarizes your emails and tells you, if you have 10 emails, what those 10 emails are about in just one email, SMS text, WhatsApp message, Google doc or whatever. GO: So an AI agent has more autonomy and decision-making capabilities than an automated workflow? EB: Definitely. The AI agent is capable of being completely autonomous to make decisions within a given context. You give it a context with defined restrictions that narrows the scope of the decisions it can make. GO: Can you provide any success stories where you worked with a client who had a specific challenge, and you created an automated workflow or agent that successfully delivered a solution? EB: The most recent example is an EdTech company in Boston that provides a training and placement program for clean energy jobs. They've been operating for the past five years, but there’s been a lack of funds, employees and program applicants to scale beyond Massachusetts. So they decided to use AI and automation to build flows without having to invest a lot of money in hiring people. What I did was streamline the application process for people interested in entering the educational program. We created a form and a workflow that takes the information from the application and puts it into an application tracking system. This system has workflows that can trigger emails, daily reports, weekly reports and invitations to interview. Then I created an AI agent. Once the applicants are interviewed by a human, we take the transcript of that, analyze it using AI, and build a report for the decision maker so they can decide if this person is capable of entering the program or not. We also created a scoring system. We built it based on human criteria, which is subjective, and then we converted that into an objective dataset so we could classify people and score them based on numbers. All of this is done by an AI agent that sets a score for the applicant at the end of the interview. Then we have a leaderboard where people are ranked, and the top 15 get into the education program and placement process. GO: Were they happy with the end result? EB: Oh yeah, very happy. Here's where the beauty and magic come in. Now the CEO can envision a way of expanding outside Massachusetts, and tell her team, "Hey, we're going to New York!" Where before, she thought she needed to hire more people in each new state to oversee the operation. And, because an AI agent works 24/7, she doesn't have to wait until 8am to get a report or transcription, or anything anymore. So now, she can think about how to scale her company more successfully without having to hire more people. GO: What's the road map looking ahead? Where are you going with the company in terms of next steps? EB: We're trying to create an outreach system because the purpose of the company is not only to train people but also to place them in clean tech job positions. The outreach system is going to help the team find more companies with open positions, so the company can place more people in those positions. We’re building a system involving AI agents and workflows where we're going to take a picture of all the open positions and analyze and understand them using AI. We want to know, what are the requirements in terms of learning and knowledge capacity for people to get in these positions, so the company can build a better training program. GO: What was the biggest challenge working with them? EB: I think the most important one, and this is something anyone working on this will experience, is the resistance of some team members who don't trust the performance of AI enough. People who have low experience working with AI, and maybe only know ChatGPT, will look at this and say, "I don't believe this can work." So that means there’s a lot of educational work. People need enough knowledge about what AI tools are capable of to suggest what can and can’t work. I think that's the main challenge. But once people see it working, they start to lean into AI. Suddenly, they become like, "This is great. Can you add this other metric? Can you make it do this other thing too? Can you make me one for my personal side hustle?" It's interesting when you see people moving from resistance to acceptance. GO: Working with you has firmly cemented something I've been preoccupied with this year. It's this: One of the most exciting things about AI, which is giving us more time back during the day, requires the most boring thing, which is having uniform file and data structure. As we've discovered together only too well, AI can't reach its full potential unless you have everything structured super cleanly. The analogy I often use is that AI is like an 8-year-old savant. The person is brilliant but he or she often needs really consistent environments and clear guardrails, or things go sideways or just crash. Can you talk about what any organization needs to focus on when it comes to file and data structure? EB: I think one of the most basic things, and I'm living this with a company I'm helping right now, is documenting files and folders exactly the same. You must set protocols for everything when you’re building a folder system to store content and data. That's one of the biggest challenges for companies trying to implement AI automation with poorly standardized systems. When we didn’t have AI a few years ago, we didn't think of a machine reading our documents or files. We never thought that could be possible, so we never really focused on creating really good file structure. The biggest challenge for companies, coming back to Matador, is how to organize the field of play so that AI doesn't struggle. We easily lose the excitement of implementing AI in an organization when an AI is trying to navigate a maze of poorly organized files. For that, you need to build SOPs that tell everyone on the team, “We're going to be naming files this way now so that a 5-year-old can read the titles and understand what's in every one of them. Because if a 5-year-old can read this set of folders and understand what's inside all of them, then AI can do that too. And if AI can find and read everything, then AI can do some truly amazing things and save companies a lot of money. GO: So how are organizations like ours, which have been in operation for a long time, supposed to go back decades and reorganize all our files? EB: We can run a workflow that can do that for you. That's where the ROI comes in. You can make a one-time investment building a workflow that's going to completely standardize all your filing and foldering. But if you do that, you have to know that the ROI might not show up right away. It's going to start paying off later in terms of the time, money, stress and everything it’s going to give back. A CEO must understand that the return on that investment is going to be ongoing through the years, not in the next quarter necessarily. If you have that mentality, then your company is going to become AI-first. GO: You’ve told me before that AI is not a tool, it's a culture. Can you explain that? EB: Right now, the biggest obstacle for AI expanding in many companies are the CEOs. I understand the challenges because they fear a lot of reputational risk. You have a board and customers that are going to be judging you. If you don't have a very good AI road map, then it could turn into a failure, and the fingers are going to be pointing at you. I understand that completely. But AI should be a culture within companies, and that starts top down because the CEO has to embrace trial and error. AI is going to fail at least during the first time you start with any automation. It's like when you're building a prompt. We were talking the other day, and you said using AI is not about writing the perfect first prompt. It's that fifth or sixth prompt that's going to get you to the right answer. You're going to be iterating with automation, too. That's something CEOs have to transmit throughout the organization. GO: I think for many tourism organizations, we haven’t even begun talking about the big picture value of AI. From an internal perspective, for example, agents offer a whole new level for optimizing operations with AI. EB: Yes, exactly. When we're in a company and we're facing challenges, the first intuitive thinking is, "How can I solve this? I'm going to Google it.” Now we're transitioning to, "How can I solve this? I'm going to ask ChatGPT.” This is great, but that's not AI-first. That's changing one tool for another. You're still browsing. It's literally the same thing. You're not really using AI. AI-first means, "I do this thing that's consuming 10 hours a week. I do the same thing every time. I spend two hours every day doing the same four steps. How can I use AI to automate this?" That's AI-first because you're using AI to stop wasting time. I think that's the culture we should be striving for. If a CEO injects the whole company with that mindset, then the employees are going to eventually use AI to solve their issues more independently and autonomously. At the end of the day, what AI really does is gives us more time and more of our lives back, and we have not yet understood that because it's new. But it's true, AI is the way for humans to have more life. GO: I want that. EB: We all do. GO: I have this belief that eventually, in any organization, all meetings will be recorded and deposited into a central knowledge base where an AI can summarize everything and connect all the key takeaways. I might have a meeting and someone on the other side of the world has a meeting, and the AI will know we're talking about the same thing. It will see and surface how there's potential opportunity to connect our efforts. It's like one plus one equals three, or more. Do you think that's where we're going and that it will benefit companies? EB: Definitely. It's the most common sense thing to do, but I know it's also counterintuitive because there are many people who would not like to have all conversations recorded. The fidelity, the accuracy of the information, and it all being in one place and uniformly structured, is everything. You can have thousands of conversations and tell the AI, "Go here and search for this specific idea in all the transcripts where we have talked about that." You just need to build the SOPs. Then a human can quality control it and say, "This is right. This isn't right. Maybe we can tweak this, or build on that." GO: I’ve experienced this firsthand where people are vehemently against this idea of all company meetings being recorded. For many it portends that clichéd dystopic future we see in science fiction, where everything's controlled and you have no freedom, right? EB: I can see it too. We must remember that these tools can be turned off. If we let the technology control us, then that's on us. I think at the end of the day, it's about how do you balance the risk and rewards? This is something CEOs are used to. Do you prefer to live in blindness and have an uncompetitive company because you decided not to take that risk with automation? Or do you take the risk and have everything recorded, even though some people are going to say it’s Orwellian in a way, and even though ultimately it's going to improve everybody's life? We have to find that balance, and that’s the CEO’s role to determine what’s best overall for the company, customers and employees in the future. GO: Any last thoughts? EB: I think we are not quite there yet to know for sure the amount of ROI that is going to come from agents and automations. Definitely it is going to be positive ROI. For that, I'm completely sure. What I'm not sure is how do we measure ROI based on the anticipated lifetime value of the process? So much is changing so quickly and it's difficult to see the future. As the tools get better, then the workflow gets better too, so the ROI increases, right? Except, we don't really have models for that. For CEOs, I think, they have to try to envision how they can measure the value of automations now, and how that might evolve exponentially in the future. Greg Oates

What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates CEOs at destination marketing and management organizations (DMOs) are seeking AI guidance specifically tailored to their chief executive roles. A CEO in the U.S. told me recently that current AI education is often too surface level, vague, unstructured, or trying to cover too much ground to be useful for a chief executive. He said, "We've been talking for a while now about how we need AI education targeting leadership, but it doesn't really exist." While destination leaders face many more questions about AI than answers, one thing is 100% clear: CEOs must own and lead their organizations' AI integration across all departments. AI isn't something to outsource or delegate to others, and it's not a "marketing thing" for the CMO to figure out. Conor Grennan , chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, consults with clients on AI strategy from JPMorgan to NASA. I asked him how important it is for CEOs to lead AI education, adoption and integration across their organizations. “CEOs have to understand how to use AI and why; they really have to have felt the delight about what AI can do,” he said. "They also have to see clearly how AI is a leadership and change management challenge, not a tech challenge. Then they need to start out being vulnerable, and be able to say, ‘Hey, I was skeptical about AI. I didn’t understand it, either. But now I can explain the way I learned it and how to communicate why it’s important to help other people understand it.” So why do CEOs need to understand AI? Jeff Bezos answered that at The New York Times DealBook Summit last year. He described how “modern AI is a horizontal enabling layer" that will soon be integrated into every device and digital application in existence. "These kind of horizontal layers like electricity and compute and now artificial intelligence, they go everywhere," he said. "I guarantee you there is not a single application that you can think of that is not going to be made better by AI." Here's the clip: Strategic AI Approaches I met with about a dozen CEOs in North America to find out what they want to know about AI specifically from a CEO perspective. Some leaders are seeking big-picture guidance with a broad overview of high-level strategy. "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” one CEO told me. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" Another chief executive said, “We see three areas of opportunity for AI: Administrative tasks and general productivity; marketing chat, SEO and data readiness; and helping customers find information about our city more effectively.… The two most important things I want to know are how to develop AI policy and how is AI changing SEO." A year ago, most CEOs had a wait-and-see attitude about AI, following how the technology evolved and what their cohorts in other organizations were doing. Today, there is a general consensus among CEOs that they need to invest in AI, but the question is how and where. One CEO told me he knows he needs to integrate AI tools and processes into his DMO, but he has three overarching questions that he wants answered first, at least at a high level: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” Other CEOs are seeking clarity on the basic fundamentals of AI: "I need to understand what are the problems that we're trying to solve with AI. What is the purpose of a chatbot, for example? What am I buying, and what can we as an organization accomplish with it?" And then others just want immediate actionable solutions: "I'm not interested in hypotheticals. Show me five ways I can implement AI on Monday. Give me turnkey AI solutions that work today." AI Data is King Personalized data is one of generative AI’s biggest value propositions. Conversational AI (chat) is the new marketplace, and it’s eating the entire funnel including in-destination engagement. In some cities, AI chat conversations between DMOs and visitors is exceeding 25% in-destination, giving DMOs a way to influence visitor behavior in real time. Also, in some industry segments like tours and activities, in-chat conversations are driving in-destination bookings with partners like GetYourGuide. Everyone is looking for first/zero-party data around that. “We have a low level of proprietary data about who is in our destination and what they’re doing,” asserted one CEO. “We have a few disparate data sources, but we need to connect those, and we want to be able to use it predictively. For example, we're looking at regression analysis to help develop future scenario modeling, and we're looking at AI to help us with that." Another CEO said, “We need data that provides material value for our partners. That’s our mandate. How are our visitors spending money and where? How are they behaving and traveling through our area? How can we help people find our partners in a more personalized way?” And one CEO added, "A key priority for us is figuring out the data equation so outbound messaging can be tailored to a 1-on-1 relationship.” Striving for that direct individual customer engagement has been the holy grail for marketers for decades. The ability to deliver mass personalization at scale is now coming into focus with enhanced AI data curation. National organizations like Destination Canada and Germany Travel have invested millions of dollars in data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to restructure their tourism product data from scratch, capitalize on the data more effectively to rank higher in AI search, and drive incremental revenue to partners. That's what the future looks like. For more information, check out the new Canadian Tourism Data Collective and Germany's Open Data Project . Today, local tourism organizations are starting to see how data structure and content architecture are strategic imperatives for them, too. One municipal CEO explained, "I think it might almost be too early to have this conversation in some areas until AI matures more. One thing I am eager to know now is how do we develop a data lake to structure our own data and messaging to make it easier for AI search tools to find." AI search and SEO are a huge conversation today. During the past year, the #1 question I heard while speaking about AI with dozens of North American destination organizations, their boards and key industry/community stakeholders, was: How do we rank higher in AI search? What happens when AI buries organic content? What’s going to happen to our websites? Are they going to disappear? Is a DMO without a website still a DMO? How do we need to produce content differently? And, what the heck is a data lake? One CEO I spoke with is planning on developing a new website for her organization. She said, "I don't even know what I don't know about AI search, but we need to figure some of that out before we start spending any money." Along with data, defining KPIs for AI integration is a hot topic of debate, and presently there isn’t a complete and codified list of metrics that DMO leaders agree on. That said, perhaps the travel and tourism industry collectively needs to understand what AI is, and what it can accomplish at scale, before attaching too many metrics to it. A CMO told me at DI MarCom Summit this month, “People didn’t ask about ROI with the internet when it first came around. We just knew we had to have it,” because it was a new channel for reaching visitors. Same as AI now. Expanding on that, he suggested that DMOs need to break AI success tracking into awareness metrics and performance metrics, and get that conversation right before anything else. Staff AI Adoption Unlike previous technology evolutions, there doesn’t seem to be as much of a generational divide between early adopters of AI and everyone else. The industry can’t look to Gen Z for guidance about how to use AI to the same degree we once asked Millennials for insights about Instagram. Again, driving AI adoption across an organization begins with the CEO. Once that’s established, the real challenge is convincing department leaders and staff to lean into AI. It's a challenge because there is widespread concern, skepticism and/or suspicion among many staff members across many industries that they’re being asked to learn new technologies that will eventually replace them. Leadership should say to employees that no one can force them to use AI, but the job market will. The data is clear. According to the Linkedin/Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index : 79% of leaders agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with Al skills than a more experienced one without 66% of leaders won’t hire someone without AI skills 60% of leaders worry their organization lacks a plan and vision to implement AI And that's a year old. But, understandably, emphasizing those numbers comes across as threatening. A better strategy for driving AI adoption is finding staff members who are already seeing success with AI, supporting them with access to education and pro AI models, and working out from there. The more employees see their colleagues using AI, the more some of them feel inclined to lean in. Therefore, every DMO needs a comprehensive strategic AI road map that includes purpose, policy, education, integration and a continuous feedback loop across all levels of staff. CEOs need to create a space for that. "We're giving our staff time to play around with AI, but they have to present what they're focusing on and what they're learning to their individual supervisor," a CEO told me. Another added, “We're focusing on staff adoption. But I need you to explain to me what works, how to implement, and what should I watch out for." I'm presently working with our departments at Matador Network to explore a bunch of various AI models to optimize workflows, boost creativity, enhance strategic planning, diversify product, etc. There's a well-communicated mandate from the top that Matador will become an AI-first company, and sooner than later. To help accelerate that, we created an AI task force to bring more perspectives from across the company together to integrate AI into operations. That has been valuable with some immediate takeaways, such as staff is now reaching out and asking for assistance with AI. But it's only a start. "There's this idea that if you can get a core group of people using AI then their attitudes and behaviors will spread organically throughout the rest of the company," said Conor Grennan at NYU. "It doesn't work that way. You have to find the people who have fears about AI and listen to them to understand why. You have to say, 'Yes, AI does suck at that, but here's what it's good at.' You also need to weed out the negative people who are against AI outright. They're dangerous." 5 Key Takeaways Let's go back to that first CEO who wants to know the five big questions about AI. Based on the input from the above CEOs, here's a first stab at that: How can I create AI policy that serves our organization but doesn't suppress experimentation among staff? (Interestingly, policy did not come up that much with the CEOs I spoke with.) How do we need to develop our websites, content and data to rank higher in AI search? How is AI SEO different, and the same, as old SEO? What are existing AI chat platforms accomplishing, how are visitors using them, and how are they influencing travel decision making and purchase behavior? If AI is not just for marketing, what does the ecosystem of AI tools for all departments look like across the organization? And what do they do in terms of increasing productivity, creativity and quality? How do I get staff to buy in? We know AI is an imperative for our organization's competitive advantage and relevance. And we know AI is an imperative for employees for their professional growth and marketability. But how do we get our people to really believe in the need to embrace AI? Greg Oates

Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Royce Chwin, president and CEO of Destination Vancouver , personifies how a DMO chief executive needs to establish and articulate the mandate for integrating AI across the organization. That was the topic of our last Destination AI post where 12 CEOs explained: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . Early in 2024, Chwin addressed the full staff in Destination Vancouver’s office before a session I was presenting there on AI. “We cannot not do this,” he said, stating that the organization needed to adopt AI processes to stay relevant in the industry and increase its value in the community. If Destination Vancouver is positioning itself as an innovative DMO, he explained, then the road ahead with AI was clear. Since then, Destination Vancouver launched a new website fully integrated with AI where visitors can customize how they find travel information. The build was a two-year process requiring an inordinate amount of learning to capitalize on generative AI. The team also developed an AI policy guide that Chwin shared for this post. The comprehensive document is designed to "provide clear protocols that maximize and encourage the use of Al tools where appropriate and safe to do so, while minimizing any potential risks and concerns." The policy guide encourages staff to use AI for "enhancing productivity, efficiency, creativity or decision-making." It defines when not to use AI models and how staff is required to review and validate all AI outputs for accuracy and bias. Also, Stefan Hawes, vp of global marketing, initiated the development of an internal AI Council, bringing together a diverse group of staff to coordinate AI processes across the organization. Chwin shared an internal briefing report outlining the purpose of the Council as follows: It is recommended that an AI Council be established immediately to provide a centralized body for managing AI-related initiatives and to expand training opportunities for team members. The Council will focus on: Setting strategic priorities related to AI Selecting use cases, implementing projects/initiatives/AI software purchases and evaluating their effectiveness Developing a data strategy to support AI adoption and initiatives Developing an AI education, literacy and adoption program Ensuring ethical compliance Fostering cross-departmental collaboration to maximize the impact of AI projects We created a similar AI task force at Matador, and the value of that cannot be overstated to better assess how staff from different departments perceive, and misperceive, AI in general. I talked with Chwin this week to better understand how a DMO CEO can best lead strategic AI implementation across his or her organization. The purpose of this post is to help inform, inspire and influence other CEOs to consider the opportunities of AI in a new light. Greg Oates: Royce, you've been a strident proponent of AI for a couple years now, and yet there are many other CEOs who are still reticent. How did you personally come to decide Destination Vancouver needed to embrace AI? Royce Chwin: The perception still of some DMOs is that we are behind when it comes to technology. We're slow to adapt. We're slow to evolve. You see all these other organizations in the travel sphere around us that are able to move much quicker. They might be capitalized better. They can adjust. They can pivot quicker to take on these new technologies, and they can experiment seemingly without the degree of fear or consternation that maybe some DMOs have. So, I think there's lots of different reasons. For us, I mean, it's day and night. We can't not do that. Our entire ecosystem that we play in has some level of AI being used. Number one is our customers. They’re using AI. So it goes back to that same idea that you and I have discussed many times before: How do we as a DMO stay relevant and how do we show value? AI is a response to answering those two things. GO: In many organizations today, there’s often skepticism and suspicion among staff about how AI might take their jobs, or they’re dismissive of AI altogether. How does your team feel about AI overall? RC: I'm not finding a fear in our organization for using AI. I think it's a different set of challenges. I think there are so many derivatives of AI out there that people don't know what to focus on. Because you can’t and don't need to focus on 40 different AI tools. The question is, what are the best tools that are most relevant to the work that I need to do? That, I think, in my experience is a bigger challenge. My sense of it is that AI can be so overwhelming. It can seem unbelievably complicated. So we had to ask ourselves, do we have the time, resources and skill sets to simply understand it? Secondly, are we asking better questions to understand what in the organization we need to solve, and can AI help? GO: In a previous post, I shared input from 12 DMO CEOs about how they feel about AI. What are you hearing from other CEOs? RC: I was over in Europe recently for Destinations International’s Global Leaders Forum where I was onstage with Sherrif Karamat (CEO of PCMA) and Petra Stušek (CEO at Ljubljana Tourism). We were talking about the importance of face-to-face meetings and so on, and Sherrif made a comment that DMOs are really behind using AI. It was kind of a blanket statement, and he's not wrong. But, I said to Sheriff that I think a lot of DMOs are behind because it's like throwing confetti in somebody's face and asking them to pick the best pieces. They don't even know what they're trying to evaluate, and it’s also moving so fast. In the meantime, our customers are running around us using AI for all kinds of things. And so I think that there's not so much a fear of using AI. It’s more that people are questioning how to respond to the increasing emergence of AI because they’re thinking, “I'm not really 100% clear on the business problem I'm trying to solve that supports my mandate.” For us, and you saw it when you visited, we were really clear on what it is that we needed to do. We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI. “We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI.” GO: I’ve been asserting that CEOs should own and lead AI adoption in their organizations to have the best chance for success. I don't mean lead it day to day. I mean the chief executive must establish the mandate that AI is something the organization is going to invest in, and articulate why and how to the entire staff. Connor Grennan, chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, emphasized to me that’s the only way this works. Do you agree? RC: Yes, I absolutely believe it must come from the CEO because the CEO has to clear the vision with the team. And with something as seismic as AI, and how it’s evolving in our daily life, in our world, I think the CEO has a responsibility to address it and how it will impact the organization. Everyone needs to understand how we’re going to use AI in alignment with our mission and strategic goals, and how it will support the mandate. That's all CEO level. That's the responsibility on my head. Also, I can't imagine going in front of my Board and asking, “Hey, what are you doing with AI? What should we do with AI?” So it has to come from the CEO, but my Board has also enabled me. Like, there's no grief from my Board. Zero. We are fully enabled. GO: You've created the necessary structure to help govern AI integration with your AI Policy and AI Council. Can you expand on the thinking behind those? RC: We developed an AI policy that’s designed to enable people to use AI and not discourage them from experimenting. Obviously, some education is required in terms of proprietary information and those kinds of things. But we're really leaning into this and we're going to assign some time for it to enable the organization to experiment and play with AI without fear of reprisal. Naturally there needs to be governance around it, but governance does not mean stopping creativity. Governance means we’re creating and delivering new opportunities for creativity. There just needs to be structure around that. Also, Stefan came up with the idea of pulling together an AI Council in the organization, which I think is fantastic. We're getting individuals from each business line, including myself, and we’re going to talk about AI, its impacts, what we need to be thinking about, and how we'll improve our website and the organization as a whole. So we're creating dialogue around it to define opportunities. For example, I'm really excited about AI as it relates to all the country market analysis that we do. We've been doing that by spreadsheet, but now we’re exploring AI to provide the insights we need to inform our market planning more effectively. There are lots of different examples like that, but you only discover them by being open to experimenting with AI. Greg Oates

Toronto & Denver Tourism Leaders on the 5 Big AI Questions for CEOs Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates A year from now, the travel and tourism sector might look back and thank Andrew Weir, president and CEO of Destination Toronto , for catalyzing how DMOs move forward with AI. At PCMA Convening Leaders in January this year, I asked Weir what CEOs need to understand about AI at a high level. Numerous other CEOs have told me there’s a complete lack of AI education specifically designed for DMO chief executives. His answer was first shared anonymously in our previous post, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” said Weir. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" At the end of that post I suggested what those five questions might be based on all the CEO insights in there, and I've since been shopping them around to vet them. A few weeks ago, for example, Richard Scharf, president and CEO at Visit Denver , suggested restructuring the questions to create a more logical hierarchy. Now, the first three deal with internal operations while the last two identify external, visitor-facing priorities. Yesterday, I spoke again with Weir, as well as Paula Port, vice president of marketing at Destination Toronto, for their input on the five questions. The goal here is to provide clear structure around AI platforms and processes for DMOs leading up to Matador Network’s collaboration with U.S. Travel at ESTO in Phoenix this fall. Together, we’ll be co-hosting an interactive, multi-station “AI Playground” educational activation during the three days of the conference. Here are the five big AI questions. These will evolve but now we have a foundation to begin building consensus on how DMOs can capitalize on opportunities and navigate challenges with AI today. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The 5 Big AI Questions 1. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? A growing number of DMO leaders say their teams embrace AI for the most part, and many are actively developing basic AI strategy. That’s a significant shift from a year ago. At the same time, there's still varying degrees of cynicism and skepticism about AI in other organizations. I asked Weir about his staff. “I don't feel like we're dragging the team into this,” he said. “It's really more a matter of how people are at such different places with AI. So our goal is figuring out how to channel all their knowledge and energy, and kind of align and unify that, without stifling anyone’s creativity.” Scharf at Visit Denver emphasized that this question should be the first one, because successful AI integration begins with understanding your staff’s grasp of AI and their appetite for leaning into it. “ChatGPT is growing like Zoom did a few years ago so we know we need to use it,” he said. “The first thing we did was survey staff to assess how they feel about AI, and how or if they’re using it. Then we started off with small bites like email. Now we think of AI as a toolkit, and we're continuing to explore what tools are appropriate for different needs.” Port added that AI integration across teams works best with both structured and self-directed learning. “We started by making everything (ChatGPT Plus, Google Gemini) available to everyone, so they were given access to tools and resources, but a lot of this is really self-directed learning,” she said. “What we're seeing now is people have taken advantage of that and moved forward with it. Some maybe a little bit further than others, so maybe we need to address that. I think we still need more use cases and more structured learning because we're not all at the same level in terms of knowing and understanding how to put AI to use.” 2. How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? Destination Toronto was one of the first North American municipal DMOs to develop an AI policy. They began the process by pulling examples from larger government-operated tourism organizations including Destination Canada and Destination British Columbia. “We set up that policy structure first in terms of what we wanted as an organization, and also being very clear that any use of AI was meant to drive business results,” said Weir. “I think we were able to get there pretty quickly because we didn't create a series of regulations. We built a series of philosophies and principles to guide where we go. It was meant to put guardrails around protecting information, while at the same time, stimulate learning and sharing. Because we said to the team that you are free and encouraged to use AI, but there is an expectation that you will share what you've learned.” Port explained further that, “We leveraged existing processes already in place from a content perspective in terms of bias, IT usage, etc. We have an assessment process for any sort of software application that we're looking to use, so we did the same with AI.” (Note: The next GuideGeek Destination AI post will be with Kara Franker, president and CEO of Visit Florida Keys, who is also an attorney. We discussed AI policy at length.) 3. How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? Scharf stated that integrating AI platforms and processes beyond marketing is “where all the work is happening now.” His organization is switching out regular stand up meetings with extended AI workshops and visiting speakers to learn more about AI tools for various use cases across departments. Leadership, he said, including himself, are present at these meetings so everyone is learning together. Weir and Port both addressed this question, saying they need to first explore how Simpleview, Cvent and other tech partners are integrating AI functionality before looking at any new AI platforms. We discussed PCMA’s Project Spark , an AI-native event development tool that includes the new Destinaitor destination sourcing platform. DMO leadership and sales teams are exploring Spark to understand how clients are using new AI software to evaluate, compare and source destinations for business events. Others, like Kara Franker mentioned above, are looking for new AI solutions to optimize their HR and accounting departments, but she said many of the available options presently are only enterprise grade. Something DMOs should really look at, and I’m not sure how/if many already are, but there is proven value in creating custom GPTs for sales teams. GPTs are like mini ChatGPTs designed for specific purposes that anyone with a ChatGPT Plus account can create. For example, a sales rep can build a knowledge base inside a GPT by uploading sales materials, examples of successful bids, product information, pricing, team members, case studies, testimonials and other data. The next step is to develop internal GPT instructions to direct what the GPT does and what it prioritizes. Following that, the rep can then chat with the GPT and ask it to create a customized bid for a potential client that pulls all relevant source materials from the knowledge base that best supports the pitch. I’m imagining the ability to create custom GPTs is going to soon be a standard and required capability for all sales teams. One of the earliest enterprise examples of this was Salesforce’s Einstein GPT, which has since morphed into Agentforce. We use them at Matador because of improved efficiency and quality. GPTs also provide a new option for creative brainstorming, which some salespeople appreciate who don't identify as being super creative. Increases in sales production can be clearly identified. However, there's increasing conversation about tracking success in other departments. When AI delivers clear improvements in efficiency and saves people significant time, how do you measure that? One concern is that people will then just work a six hour day versus eight hours. The common thinking is that organizations will need to adjust productivity benchmarks, but this is a messy conversation. I don’t know enough to comment on that yet, but I wanted to put a pin in it because it’s something we’ll all need to look at eventually as AI scales in the workforce. 4. How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? I was addressing Visit Denver’s Board a while back and one member suggested that DMOs won’t need websites soon because they’ll be replaced by a ChatGPT-like window. I’m surprised by how much this comes up. For one thing, DMOs will always need some kind of online knowledge base for AI search queries. If anything, that will require more content and more comprehensive product information because AI search thrives more than anything on data structure, clarity and specificity. That said, the web user interface will likely evolve considerably. Expect to hear a lot more about how DMOs are developing data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to optimize data structure for AI search. For further context, here's a Perplexity Pro response to the question: "Are tourism boards developing data lakes and warehouses to optimize their sites for AI search?" Weir suggested that this conversation about the future of websites is not unlike what we went through 15 years ago, when people were lamenting the death of DMO sites because social media was deemed by some as the new web. More important, he asserted, is seeing how AI search is evolving and being prepared to adapt strategy. “I think there is a push-pull here between how we lead and where customers are at,” said Weir. “We want to deliver more information through our AI assistant and AI search in general, but customers aren't really there yet. I don't know what the percentage is, but the majority of people are still using Google. They're still beginning an interaction on the web by entering search terms in Google the traditional way. At some point, that's going to flip, right? It's going to be a few percent more each month or quarter, whatever that is. But how far ahead of it do we get? And how do we calibrate? We can try to lead on this, but you know, we also have to stay in step with where our customers are too.” 5. How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? Chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI have dashboards that clearly identify what visitors are asking about in the destination. That helps inform content and product development strategy, and the data is valuable for community engagement. AI chat platforms also operate 24/7 in 50+ languages, which helps DMO influence in-destination travel and spending for a much wider audience than ever before. How to best capitalize on conversational AI, and ultimately conversational commerce, is an evolving topic because we’re still in the early days where travelers are learning they can search with large language models and trust them. ChatGPT has 400 million weekly users but ChatGPT only added full functioning search capability for all users a few months ago. Consumers are just beginning to understand that they can now “talk” to a city. To help accelerate understanding and adoption of AI chat among visitors, Port asserted that the onus is on DMOs to promote their AI chat robustly like any other channel. Weir did that recently by highlighting Destination Toronto’s GuideGeek-powered “6ix” chat platform on LinkedIn, asking, “Ever had a chat directly with a city?” Weir was specifically promoting the organization’s WhatsApp platform, where people can now have a highly personalized, iterative conversation directly with Destination Toronto via the GuideGeek AI integration. The same functionality exists with the other Meta platforms, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. A few hours after Weir's post I received a Slack message from our CTO Stefan Klopp wondering what was going on in Toronto. WhatsApp volume was spiking, he said, and he was asking if Toronto had sent out a press release promoting 6ix, or something. No, it was just a quick CEO social media post. Also, Tourism New Zealand just launched a new campaign in collaboration with “A Minecraft Movie” that integrates GuideGeek-powered prompt questions to trigger further engagement. So, those are just a couple examples of how DMO/NTOs can drive AI chat engagement. The question for Weir and Port though is about the types of questions people are asking in AI chat platforms. Presently, a lot of the chat conversations are more utilitarian, related to queries about hotels, restaurants, attractions, events, directions, etc. So as conversational AI adoption increases, will DMOs focus more on developing content that answers those basic types of questions, like what hotel, restaurant or attraction is highly rated, and how to get there. Or, should DMOs continue to focus mainly on developing what is generally perceived as more inspirational destination and experiential content? "The question then becomes about responding to inquiries versus the inspirational side," explained Port. "Like, all of these articles, all of this content that we serve up, that is not in response to a question per se. It's more packaged to inspire people. I think a lot of that's going to have to exist outside our environments, maybe, whether it's influencers, it's your earned media strategy, it's content partnerships, things like that. That's where I think the inspiration will exist. But we really have to move to being more of the informative one, on our website or whatever a website is. But it needs to be very specific in answering questions. We already see that on GuideGeek." Weir summed up, saying, "I think this ends up relating more to, again, that question of where the customers are. Are we putting ourselves in a position to answer their questions and deliver the information in the way they're looking for it, using AI and the data lake approach? Or, are we curators like we've always been, inspiring visitors with local experiences, or is the customer now the curator by virtue of how they're asking questions today?" Summary These five takeaways are aligned with the five big AI questions. AI adoption begins with talking to DMO staff to understand what the organization is working with. Love the idea about marrying structured and self-directed learning, and being intentional about that with staff. At some point, for AI adoption to scale and continually evolve on an ongoing basis, there needs to be AI leaders in any organization who pick up the torch and inspire their colleagues to lean into AI. Otherwise, things tend to plateau with the same people using the same AI models. AI policy is intended to encourage staff to innovate with AI as much as it's meant to protect organizations. AI is the death of "I don't know," so it can benefit all staff in all departments. That in itself is enough ROI to validate initial investments in AI. The tools can provide a foundation of knowledge and direction for problem solving and strategic planning exponentially better than traditional search. Some organizations, like Visit Greece who we work with, have phenomenal website data structure ideally optimized for AI search. Meanwhile, one CEO told me "Our website is a mess with outdated content and poor data structure. We need to rebuild from scratch with AI search top of mind." Chat is the new marketplace, and AI is eating the entire funnel including in-destination. Moreover, AI chat data provides DMO leaders with insights into what visitors are asking about. Although, I think as chat adoption scales mainstream, the conversations will evolve beyond asking for a good hotel or restaurant. Greg Oates

Why Small Steps With AI Create Big Wins for Tourism Organizations Sep 22 Written By Greg Oates Key Theme: How to Align Strategic Risk Management and Progressive AI Implementation The rush to transform everything with AI has dominated boardroom discussions since ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Yet the most successful organizations aren't pursuing wholesale AI overhauls. They're taking calculated, incremental steps that deliver real value while building capabilities for the future. MIT researchers interviewed senior managers at 21 large companies actively using generative AI. Their findings challenge the prevailing narrative about AI transformation. Companies are deliberately choosing "small t" transformations over risky, large-scale implementations. This approach works particularly well for tourism organizations where customer trust and regulatory compliance matter deeply. Tourism organizations face unique challenges with AI adoption. Customer data privacy concerns run high. Regulatory requirements vary across jurisdictions. Service quality directly impacts reputation. The research reveals that successful companies treat AI implementation like climbing a risk slope. They start with low-risk internal applications before moving to customer-facing solutions. This measured approach isn't about being timid. It's about being smart. Tourism CEOs can build organizational confidence, develop necessary skills, and demonstrate tangible value before tackling more complex implementations. Start With Universal Productivity Tools That Employees Already Want to Use The research uncovered a surprising reality. Employees were already using ChatGPT and other public AI tools without permission. Companies responded by providing secure, private versions of these tools. This grassroots adoption pattern offers tourism organizations a clear starting point. Consider how your marketing team writes destination descriptions. Your operations staff creates training materials. Your finance team prepares reports. These tasks consume hours of employee time across every department. Private AI instances from providers like ChatGPT or Claude eliminate security concerns while boosting productivity. McKinsey built a custom platform called Lilli that connects AI to 40 internal knowledge sources. The result? Seventy-five percent employee adoption in under a year. Time savings up to 30%. Substantially improved work quality. Tourism organizations don't need to build something this sophisticated initially. Even basic AI writing assistants can transform daily work. Microsoft Copilot integration takes this further. Employees can search across company documents instantly. They can pull content from emails, meeting transcripts, and presentations. One manager described it as having "a super search engine" for company information. Imagine your team finding that obscure policy document from three years ago in seconds rather than hours. The beauty of starting here? Minimal risk. Maximum adoption. Employees want these tools. They're probably already using consumer versions. Providing enterprise versions addresses security concerns while meeting existing demand. Your IT team maintains control. Your employees get productivity gains. Everyone wins. Some employees will still seek external tools for specific needs. One product manager uses Midjourney for quick visuals. Another uses voice-to-text tools for performance reviews. Accept this reality. Focus on providing core tools internally while establishing clear guidelines for external tool usage. Deploy AI for Specific Roles While Keeping Humans in Control Once basic AI tools gain traction, tourism organizations can target specific job functions. The key insight from the research? Maintain human oversight for quality control. This "human in the loop" approach reduces risk while capturing efficiency gains. Customer service represents an ideal starting point for tourism organizations. AI can help agents find information quickly. It can suggest responses in real time. It can analyze call patterns to identify coaching opportunities. MIT researchers found AI coaching tools increased call center productivity by 14% on average. New and low-skilled workers improved by 34%. Morgan Stanley equipped financial advisors with an AI assistant trained on over one million internal documents. The tool doesn't replace advisors. It helps them find information faster so they can focus on customer relationships. Tourism organizations can apply this same principle. Help your concierge staff access local recommendations instantly. Enable tour guides to answer obscure historical questions accurately. Support reservation agents with instant access to availability across properties. CarMax demonstrates another powerful application. The company uses AI to generate descriptions for over 5,000 car pages. Manual creation would take multiple humans 11 years. With AI, it takes hours. The 80% approval rate from editorial review proves quality doesn't suffer. Tourism organizations can apply this to property descriptions, tour summaries, and destination guides. Creative teams at Dentsu use AI throughout their workflow. From proposals to budgeting to ideation. The emerging technology director noted employees spend less time on mundane tasks. They create higher-quality content with less effort. Tourism marketing teams can similarly accelerate campaign development, social media content creation, and promotional material design. Finance departments traditionally resist new technology. Yet some organizations successfully use AI for audit reports, regulatory compliance, and fraud detection. Amazon's finance team reports employees shifted from repetitive tasks to critical thinking work. Tourism organizations can start with expense report processing or invoice matching before tackling complex financial analysis. Transform Customer Experiences Gradually With Clear Boundaries Customer-facing AI sits highest on the risk slope. Yet the potential rewards justify careful exploration. The research shows companies succeeding by setting clear boundaries and expanding gradually. Chatbots evolved from frustrating phone trees to sophisticated conversational agents. John Hancock's insurance chatbots handle common queries effectively. Human agents focus on complex issues. Starbucks, Domino's, and CVS expanded to voice interactions. Video interactions come next. Tourism organizations can start with FAQ chatbots on their websites. Add booking assistance once that works well. Expand to voice-based concierge services when ready. Personalization transforms online shopping experiences. Tapestry, parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, uses real-time language modifications. The conversational tone mimics in-store associates. Revenue increased at least 3%. Tourism organizations can personalize trip recommendations based on past bookings. Adjust website content for different traveler segments. Customize email campaigns for individual preferences. Software companies already embed AI throughout their products. Adobe users create and modify images effortlessly. Canva simplifies presentation creation. Lucidchart converts text descriptions into flowcharts. Tourism organizations benefit as their existing software vendors add AI features. Property management systems will suggest optimal pricing. Booking platforms will predict cancellation risks. Marketing tools will automate campaign optimization. The key? Start small. Test thoroughly. Expand gradually. A failed internal productivity tool frustrates employees. A failed customer-facing AI damages your brand. Move up the risk slope deliberately. Build Foundational Capabilities Before Attempting Major Transformations The research revealed an uncomfortable truth. Scaling AI from pilot to production is harder than expected. Data quality issues multiply. Edge cases appear more frequently. Integration challenges compound. Many organizations discovered they needed stronger foundations before pursuing ambitious AI projects. CarMax's chief information officer emphasized data quality. "Good data will give you good results from AI." Poor data produces unreliable outputs. Tourism organizations must audit their data systems. Customer records across multiple systems need reconciliation. Historical booking data requires cleaning. Property information needs standardization. Governance structures matter equally. Who approves AI projects? How do you measure success? What happens when AI makes mistakes? Establish these frameworks before scaling implementations. Small pilots can proceed without perfect governance. Enterprise deployments cannot. Capital One's chief scientist warned against the "gold-rush mentality." Thoughtful, responsible implementation beats rushed deployment. Build the scaffolding to bring everyone along. Tourism organizations should resist pressure to match competitors' AI announcements. Focus on sustainable progress over headlines. Management buy-in proves essential for larger projects. One technology company's AI efforts stagnated until the CEO personally championed them. Small wins build credibility for bigger investments. Document productivity gains from initial deployments. Share customer satisfaction improvements. Make the business case concrete before requesting major funding. Summary: Small Transformations Today Enable Big Transformations Tomorrow The research delivers a clear message for tourism CEOs. Successful AI implementation doesn't require revolutionary change. It requires evolutionary progress. Start with universal productivity tools that employees already want. Target specific roles with human oversight. Transform customer experiences within careful boundaries. Build foundational capabilities systematically. This approach particularly suits tourism organizations. Your business depends on human connections. Technology should enhance these connections, not replace them. Your customers value authentic experiences. AI should enable better experiences, not artificial ones. Your reputation takes years to build and moments to destroy. Measured AI deployment protects what you've built while enabling future growth. The companies studied aren't waiting for perfect AI solutions. They're using today's technology to solve real problems while preparing for tomorrow's possibilities. They're training employees, cleaning data, and establishing governance. When breakthrough AI capabilities arrive, they'll be ready to capitalize quickly. Tourism organizations can follow this same path. Deploy AI writing assistants next month. Add customer service chatbots next quarter. Enhance personalization next year. Each step builds on the last. Each success enables the next. Small transformations compound into competitive advantage. The AI transformation race isn't won by the fastest starter. It's won by consistent, strategic progress. Tourism CEOs who embrace "small t" transformation today position their organizations for "big T" transformation tomorrow. The journey starts with a single step up the risk slope. Greg Oates

How to Develop AI Strategy for Your Organization Oct 12 Written By Greg Oates The 2050 City AI Roadmap provides a high-level strategic framework for how DMOs and other organizations can capitalize on AI to optimize internal operations, resources and knowledge, and ultimately, drive partner revenue. DMOs have all kinds of strategic plans, master plans, business and marketing plans, etc. The 2050 City AI Roadmap outlines the process to develop your AI strategic plan. It defines the big picture outlook for AI as the future of commerce, and it proposes a methodology to help DMO leaders prioritize, organize and navigate how they go about integrating AI across their organization. Presently, we're rolling this out with Visit Mesa , Tourism Richmond in British Columbia, and The Florida Keys & Key West . The three CEOs for those organizations have all agreed to share takeaways and business outcomes with each others' teams to cross-pollinate learning and accelerate AI process integration. That spirit of knowledge sharing and co-learning for me is huge, because we as an industry are all pretty much flying blindly with AI from a macro perspective. Yes, we've come a long way in the last year. Every DMO CEO I talk to these days is now implementing various AI processes and seeing value. However, we're all kind of flying this plane while we're building it at the same time, and we don't really have a destination, or even due north, in mind. The 2050 City AI Roadmap was designed to identify where we're going with this emergent technology that's both incredibly powerful and often highly unpredictable. It also defines how high-end AI chat platforms, like Matador Network's GuideGeek AI , are the tip of the spear for agentic commerce. The following guidelines are based on experience in the workplace to deliver new value with AI for your team, board, industry partners and community stakeholders. Internal & External Direction Every decision related to AI strategy should first be defined through an internal or external lens. Your board members will typically view internal workplace optimization as tactical. Externally, AI integrations that are consumer-facing and revenue generating are usually perceived as more strategic. Internal Facing From an internal standpoint, the focus of the AI Roadmap is on optimizing operations to take advantage of an organization's aggregate of resources and knowledge. Imagine the totality of insights across every team member in terms of their expertise and networks in their communities. AI systems are designed to pool and capitalize on that, but only if an organization's knowledge base is structured intelligently. That means rebuilding your folder structures and files naming conventions so an AI can find everything. According to Slack, workers spend 41% of their time on menial tasks, including endless hours just looking for information. The overall losses related to productivity, quality of work and workplace, and physical/mental health are crazy. So let's start there with AI strategy to address our internal digital dumpster fire. External Facing Externally, from a marketing, sales and visitor/partner engagement perspective, AI strategy begins with integrating a robust AI chat platform like GuideGeek. DMOs have never really had proprietary information on who their visitors are. They have geo-location, credit card spend, event attendance data, etc., which show visitor behavior. But none of those really identify visitor motivations and mindsets indepth. With an AI chat platform, DMOs can now pull analytics showing what visitors are actually asking and what they want to know on an individual and aggregate basis. We launched our new GuideGeek V2 analytics dashboard this past week, which provides deeper, fuller insights into visitor psychographics. That data then informs all kinds of resource allocation decisions related to content development, AI SEO strategy, data analysis, product and destination development, community engagement, etc. CEO Roles AI is best defined as a new digital "co-intelligence" that can communicate, reason and create for the first time ever, versus just another new technology. We emphasize that AI is really a new environment for collaboration more than anything, just not solely among humans anymore. Learning AI is not like learning Photoshop. You can only "teach" AI up to a point, like trying to teach someone how to ride a bike. You can't teach a child how to stay on two wheels without falling in a classroom. He or she actually has to start pedaling, and eventually the child's mind and body basically have a conversation, so to speak, with the bike to grasp the fundamentals of moving forward successfully. Same with AI. The only way to learn AI is to use AI. Helping human teams embrace this new co-intelligence (and it's not like there's a choice) falls under the umbrella of change management. That's a CEO's wheelhouse. It will take more than a few years for many humans to reconcile their minds and values with this new relationship, and it falls on the CEO's shoulders to steward that reconciliation. Likewise, CEOs oversee AI governance, policy and privacy. I've shared before how AI governance should be viewed less like a car brake and more like a steering wheel to inform, direct and accelerate AI adoption and integration. Lastly, only CEOs can scale long-term AI benefits and business outcomes effectively. You can't really delegate this. AI efforts will plateau at times, some or many AI experimentations will fail, and there are always staff members who will drag their feet because they just don't like AI. DMO CEOs are chief people officers and it's on them to create the right culture for scaling AI platforms and processes effectively for everyone in their crews. Agentic AI This is where things get interesting. AI agents and agentic commerce might sound super confusing for many or most staff members. Lots of land mines to watch out for, sure, but even more reasons for us building a macro DMO AI strategic framework. One of the key objectives for the AI Roadmap is to elevate AI agents and agentic commerce as the two interrelated cornerstones for AI strategy, and explain why. Doing so shows the true big picture value of AI, and it drives home how we eventually need to move way beyond training people the basics of prompting. Yes, it's intimidating, but we introduce the labels and contexts relating to agentic AI early on in the process. That gets some people thinking bigger about AI, and it entices the AI champions in the group to start experimenting with agents. AI Agents (Internal) For internal AI strategy, leading DMOs are developing AI agents and automated workflows to address the aforementioned 41% of time that staff members spend on grunt work and trying to find information. They are proven, they work, and most of all, they deliver measurable ROI. We're working with outside contractors at Matador to develop and implement agents and automations for both ourselves internally and for DMO clients. We are already seeing success, and there's been a recent influx among our people asking for agents. It's an amazing thing to see when staff members start requesting new AI integrations like that, proactively. That's when you know your AI strategy is working at least on some level. Agentic Commerce (External) AI agents are also the foundation for agentic commerce. According to Mastercard , "Agentic commerce is a new form of online and mobile shopping, in which an AI agent 'closes the loop' or completes tasks for a user — such as searching for items, comparing options and making a purchase — with limited or no manual inputs needed from that user. For example, while chatting in a generative AI app, you could tell the AI agent, 'Book me a nonstop flight to London for under $600 next week — no red-eyes,' and the agent will review airlines, nearby airports and your loyalty memberships and payment card rewards to identify the best option, purchase it and then share it with you." Just like with AI agents, developing agentic commerce architecture covers a wide spectrum of sophistication and capabilities. Going back to the analogy of flying a plane while building it with no clear final destination in mind, agentic commerce is the point on the map where we want to land. With GuideGeek, we have Kayak, GetYourGuide, Skyscanner and other booking tools integrated into the platform with a click-through UX/UI. Looking ahead, we're working with one national tourism organization to bring some of their national partners' booking engines (air, hotel, tour op, etc.,) into the platform to eventually convert sales in-chat. Subscribe to Mastercard Signals to keep up-to-date on agentic commerce and access intelligence like this Mastercard Payments Trends Navigator report. Staff Training & AI Integration Training staff and implementing AI processes across all departments is really the meat of the 2050 City Roadmap. But none of that should proceed without DMO leadership embracing all the above, and communicating it clearly to all staff. Easier said than done, though. Leadership needs to continually communicate a high-level approach to AI strategy, because it won't really click for many staff (or leadership) at the beginning of this process. That, of course, needs to be married with all the practical training initiatives we're continuing to develop. We've already learned a ton with the present work we're doing training DMO teams. Here are a few very basic takeaways just to start explaining our process. There are obviously many more educational modules following these, ranging from predictive analytics to specific department AI training in areas like HR, finance and legal. Conduct an internal AI survey asking all staff to share their perceptions and usage of AI. Follow that up with small group interviews across the organization, and transcribe everything with an AI notetaker. We use Granola, but there are many others. Also, explain to staff that all meetings regarding AI will be recorded to create an internal knowledge base to identify opportunities, challenges and takeaways over time. Start training with a focus on just the paid/pro models of ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. Some staff feel confused with the sheer variety of available AI tools in front of them. We explain that, at the end of the day, the basics of using AI include an end user, an AI tool, and a knowledge base. Get people on board with that, and then show how most of the AI tools they have access to are similar in many ways. One of the fastest methods to advance AI understanding is showing staff how to create custom GPTs in ChatGPT. Some team members will pick up on these quickly and start integrating them into their workflows right away. These are the people who typically make up your internal AI taskforce. Explain and show how Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot are AI workhorses that connect with the majority of people's daily workflows. However, humans tend to think of those as just the next evolution of search engines. This is mental wiring that needs to be broken. Gemini and Copilot are great/good in some ways, but I've found that training staff on just those three native LLMs first (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) is more effective for seeing the light. Google NotebookLM has a lot of fans. I like to walk teams through it because it's a good way to reinforce what a knowledge base is, like we do with the custom GPTs. Also, the automated audio and video podcasts are crowd pleasers, especially with the new Join function where users can engage directly with the agentic podcast hosts. People don't seem to want to read anymore. This was a rude awakening for us when we first launched the AI Roadmap with a series of online training materials. We now know we need to deliver short video instruction if we want anyone to actually look at the educational content. People love Descript for AI-powered video creation. Once we started showing how to use Descript, we were pleasantly surprised to see how staff really leaned in. Teaching Descript provides a fun break early in the process because people can see pretty amazing results in minutes and wrap their minds around the process fairly easily. Ask all staff to share how they're using AI effectively and where they see AI failing them. Catalogue the case studies and share across the organization to accelerate learning, inspire a healthy sense of internal competition, and track learning over time. Staff members are also often wowed seeing AI agents in action. We use n8n to develop agents, where you can create a lot of basic automated workflows quickly. Once a few early adopters see how agents can take over some of their more tedious, time-consuming tasks, others will jump in. Feedback Loop & Funding/Board Support This line in the AI Roadmap is broken down into tactical internal optimization and more strategic, consumer-facing and revenue-generating sales, marketing and stakeholder engagement. I don't have a lot to share for this section and the following one because our focus to date has been mostly on the above phases. Feedback Loop The reason we record every engagement with AI Roadmap clients is to scale learning, so if one person learns something, everyone can benefit. That will be further multiplied when we starting sharing takeaways across DMOS, and eventually the industry as a whole. Visit Mesa, Tourism Richmond and Visit Florida Keys are eager to lead this initiative, and we plan to launch a new AI thought leadership framework collectively in 2026. Funding & Board Support The spark that led to developing the AI Roadmap happened almost a year ago when a board member for a large DMO told me that she viewed AI integration as merely a tactic. If this work can elevate AI in the minds of board members toward a more high-level strategic imperative, then we'll have achieved part of our mission. There's still some work to be done first though to collect more case studies showing direct AI business outcomes before we can make a more solid case for additional funding for AI integrations. AI Strategic Plan We've produced a mockup of what we think an AI Strategic Plan will eventually look like, but it's too early to show presently. For now, we've identified three overarching pillars, each with potential strategies, action items, timelines and targets. The KPIs are crucial, of course, for scaling AI strategy across the travel industry. Right now, we're thinking the three pillars might look like the following, although this is all up in the air right now: Optimize Internal Operations & Knowledge: The strategies include cleaning up internal folders/files to improve AI outcomes in general and develop AI agents specifically. A lot in here on training, experimentation, overall adoption, success measures, etc. Increase Partner Revenue with Agentic AI: Defining how DMOs develop AI agents to fuel agentic commerce is the big goal overall with the AI Roadmap. Initial strategies in this pillar begin with more low hanging fruit though, such as website redevelopment, optimizing for AI SEO, AI chat integration, etc. Expand Community Collaboration: We're seeing more DMOs take a leading role in AI education for their industry and community stakeholders. The 2050 City Roadmap is perfectly suited for informing how DMO leaders can facilitate community AI workshops and increase the organization's overall relevance and value. Greg Oates

Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Kara Franker , president and CEO of The Florida Keys & Key West tourism organization, was among the first DMO leaders to embrace AI platforms and processes in 2023 when she was chief executive at Visit Estes Park in Colorado. In May 2024, Franker published two papers on AI strategy and policy: From the Base of the Rocky Mountains to the World: A case study through Visit Estes Park’s journey into Generative AI solutions — and how your DMO can carve its own AI path Navigating AI and the Law in the Travel Industry: An Introduction to Legal Implications for DMOs The first paper highlights how Visit Estes Park integrated GuideGeek AI chat into their website and three Meta platforms: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The DMO also branded the chat Rocky Mountain Roamer to give it an identity and bit of personality. The second paper focused on AI policy and data privacy, security and compliance. Franker, who is an attorney, co-wrote that with Roxanne Steinhoff , also an attorney at Steinhoff Law, who leads the firm’s destination marketing and sports tourism practice. I caught up with Franker to see how her perspectives on AI strategy and policy are evolving almost a year later. Greg Oates: You've been leading AI strategy in tourism for almost two years beginning with your work at Visit Estes Park. However, there’s still a lack of AI training today specific for DMO CEOs, and many leaders are presently unsure how to proceed with AI. As a CEO, what’s your take on that? Kara Franker: I'm not surprised that there's a lack of training because there's just so much for everybody to wrap their heads around. I think some people are trying to watch and wait and see. My philosophy has been more of a fall-forward, fail-forward kind of approach. That's why I put the white papers out. Anybody could learn from what we had done, and do it better. You know, a case study is sometimes the best way to figure this stuff out, so that's why we did it. The second paper on AI policy was with Roxanne Steinhoff on the legal and ethical implications of AI. Because when I would go and speak in front of groups, those were always the big questions from the leadership. They don't know how far is too far once you open this can of worms. That's why we got together and started to put guardrails in place that we thought might make sense for people to study, just as a first stab at it. That all launched last summer, so I do think that there's a little bit of education out there but we could definitely use more. GO: What do DMOs need to know about AI policy at a very high level in terms of privacy and security? KF: Employee and client information should be kept private and not uploaded into any AI tools. That could be a big deal, thinking of all the different rules and regulations about collecting information, especially how it's more stringent in Europe than in the United States. That can cause potential problems if you're uploading, say, a client list that has personal cell phones, email addresses or other information that people just don't want out there. So, it's really more about information that's attached to a person. And then, is there competitive data that you don't necessarily want others to have? Possibly, but so much of what we do in the DMO space is public anyways so the lines for that are pretty blurry. I’m trying to imagine a scenario where a DMO is, like, basically hacking somebody else's information through AI. I can’t imagine that’s worth the time and effort, or even possible. GO: A few months ago we were discussing what AI tools might be available for DMO departments like HR and accounting to help with privacy, compliance, efficiency, etc. But everything available seems to be enterprise grade and out of reach for DMOs. So what’s the answer for scaling AI across an organization? KF: I think this is a huge need. I hired somebody from Cisco who’s my new VP of technology and partnerships. She's a total AI nerd like I am, and way more qualified to dive into all this. She and I have been looking at different options to put together, almost like little plugins. We really, really need this. For example, how do we take an AI solution from the legal world to analyze all our contracts so that we don't have to spend as many hours with attorneys, because we really just need a template, right? And then for HR, same thing. How do we organize all our employee files into a much more streamlined and effective system? And then there’s our policies. We're a nonprofit but everything we do is so heavily influenced by County government. We have so many compliance issues, so I want an AI to learn every single piece of County policies so we’re able to compare and contrast what we're doing with those policies. I haven't been able to find anything to help with these things. We've looked at a lot of different options but it's like what you're saying. They're these big enterprise pieces built for law firms or financial people, and they’re all really expensive. None of them fit the mold for improving different operations at a DMO. In my mind, the marketing side is covered, especially with GuideGeek, and there are so many great options now for everything involved with marketing. So I feel like that's been tackled and done really well. But for the operations, we need more. I mean, we’ve just got to keep digging deeper, I think. GO: When you and your technology person from Cisco figure all this out, will you share what you find with the rest of us? KF: Of course, always. GO: Backing up a bit, you were arguably the very first DMO CEO to lean into AI, at least in North America, when you were with Visit Estes Park. How did you convince your board that investing in AI was important at the time, and what were some of your processes with bringing along staff? KF: We were fortunate in the sense that the board was all in and the staff were all in. And I don't mean to make age a part of it, but the staff was a little on the young side and they were all very ambitious. Everybody wanted to try to figure it out. So we made the argument to the board, if we could figure out some of what AI could do, it would make the community stronger and they could take pieces of it back to their businesses. There wasn't really anybody who was against experimenting and trying it out. We made some mistakes along the way and we put that in the white paper. Also, when we first rolled out GuideGeek, which scrapes the website, we found a few holes in our content. There were particular board members who didn't have very robust information about their business, so they got a little bit mad, but not in a, like, burn it down way. It was more of, "Oh, okay, we have some work to do." So part of the AI process has to actually be community outreach. It can't just be about the technology. We have to talk to all our partners and get really robust information from them, so when the AI crawls the site it gets the best possible information about our partners. GO: One thing you did at Visit Estes Park was brand your GuideGeek AI as Rocky Mountain Roamer on your website and three Meta platforms. We use that as a case study a lot, and emphasize that a DMO should promote their AI just like any other channel, right? KF: Definitely. We knew we had to put money behind marketing the tool if we wanted people to interact with it. Traditionally with a DMO, one of your calls to action is to send people to the website. Our new call to action for a lot of our campaigns back then was to send people to the AI, so we called it Rocky Mountain Roamer to help promote and drive traffic to it. And then in terms of KPIs, we wanted to track all the interactions you can see in the backend, but not just how many people used it. We wanted to know how long people interacted with the AI, what their journey was, and what they were asking about because that’s where things get really interesting. GO: After the initial thrill of launching GuideGeek, how did you manage how staff used AI internally? Were there any incentives involved to help spur adoption and experimentation? KF: The incentive for my team was, well, it wasn't really an incentive. It was a requirement. They had to write weekly reports for me about how they tested something with AI, whatever it was. It could apply to their job or not, I didn't really care. So I almost forced them to try AI. But then people started really getting into it. They were getting more and more user friendly with different AI tools, and they would be like, “Oh, I like Anthropic because of this or that,” because they were branching out from just using ChatGPT. So, yeah, there has to be almost like a culture of AI in your DMO for it to really work, and it's on the CEO to create and foster that. Greg Oates

Join Matador Network's AI Playground at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Matador Network, GuideGeek AI and U.S. Travel are launching the inaugural "AI Playground" at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix, August 17-19. The educational space, hands-on demo area, genius bar and live sessions will run all three days during the conference. We are also producing programming specific for travel industry CEOs, along with other sessions dedicated for senior executives, highlighting actionable AI strategies focusing on real world business outcomes. Leading up to ESTO, I'll be reaching out to many of you requesting any AI-related success stories and/or questions you might have for the AI Playground. Looking back over the last two years, it's clear the industry is turning a corner in 2025 when it comes to AI learning and adoption. Many DMOs and their industry partners are now integrating AI processes and platforms across their organizations, whereas last year many destination leaders were still in wait-and-see mode. For those of you still on the fringes, it is our ambition that the AI Playground will plant a flag in the ground showing how AI is now a proven strategy for helping DMOs further deliver on their mandate. "AI is clearly powering the future of travel and how people explore the world today," says Ross Borden, founder and CEO of Matador Network. "We are stoked to be working with U.S. Travel and investing in our industry to produce the AI Playground. AI will become standard operating procedure for every DMO soon, and we're excited to help lead this journey." DMO CEOs on AI Strategy Matador launched its proprietary GuideGeek AI chat platform for DMO websites and social media channels almost two years ago. We now have more than 40 DMOs onboard, and we're expanding the scope of GuideGeek AI with new hotel groups and tour operators joing in recent months. Based on our experience working with municipal, regional and national organizations across the global visitor industry, we have unparalleled insights into how conversational AI is changing the relationship between destinations and visitors, as well as how DMOs operate internally. In preparation for ESTO 2025, we launched this GuideGeek Destination AI newsletter in January to ramp up our industry outreach and further expand our understanding of how DMO leaders are navigating the rise of AI. Here are five stories from the newsletter that inform high-level decision making related to AI strategy, with input from more than 15 CEO DMOs: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI : Our first post with 12 DMO CEOs highlighted the wide range of questions they have. One asked for the five big AI questions he should know about. Another wants practical advice on five AI initiatives that he can implement, like, tomorrow. Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism : CEO Royce Chwin, who helms Destination Vancouver, shared why his organization was one of the first DMOs in the world to dive into AI. Destination Toronto & Visit Denver CEOs on the 5 Big AI Questions in Tourism : Two chief executives, Andrew Weir in Toronto and Richard Scharf in Denver, worked out what they believe are the five big AI themes/questions that DMOs need to focus on, as touched on in the first post. Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation : Newly installed Florida Keys CEO Kara Franker, who is also an attorney, shed light on AI policy, compliance and the need for more non-enterprise AI solutions for her organization. Visit Mesa CEO Launches New DMO AI Road Map : Another visionary DMO chief executive, Visit Mesa leader Marc Garcia is bringing a new level of structure and direction for integrating AI processes and platforms. Next up, Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau, will be discussing AI strategy from a business events perspective. I also met with Cody Chomiak, vice president of marketing at Travel Manitoba, who's really lighting a fire in Canada around AI thought leadership and adoption. He'll be sharing a few powerful AI case studies from his provincial marketing organization, both internal and visitor-facing. AI Playground at ESTO 2025 The AI Playground this year will feature three stations at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge . We will have our Matador GuideGeek team and U.S. Travel staff on hand to guide participants through the space, along with some invited AI experts from around the industry. We'll be digging into a handful of paid AI models including ChatGPT Plus/Teams, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro, Google AI Pro, Microsoft Copilot Pro and Manus. We'll show how AI is best navigated at DMOs by bucketing strategy into three unique categories: Search, Create and Sales. Specific use cases will include content generation and data analysis, AI SEO and AI-optimized web development, AI policy and governance, staff adoption, building custom GPTs for sales proposals, and automated workflows and AI agents, among others. The three stations are: The Prompt Lab welcomes all attendees to come in and test drive various AI models. The interactive, hands-on learning station will have multiple laptops for experimenting with AI tools for people of all skill levels. We'll have a bunch of paid AI models pre-loaded for live demos and one-on-one conversations showing how AI actually works and some of what it accomplishes across different departments. Feel free to bring your own laptop if you like. The Genius Bar is designed for individual and group Q&A about real world AI strategy, implementation and ROI. We'll be collecting all the questions posed to share with the broader industry afterward, so we'll have a couple crowdsourcing boards to help generate new ideas and explore new solutions. Reach out to me if you want to schedule time to talk during ESTO. The AI Theater seating area will host a range of AI-focused dialogues, micro-presentations and a few dedicated sessions designed for CEOs, as well as other senior executives. The programming schedule for all those will engagements be included in the ESTO agenda. Most importantly, all the conversations at the AI Playground will highlight tangible AI case studies and specific business outcomes. The 5 Big Questions About AI One of the best things to come out of all the interviews with DMO CEOs this year is our list of the five big AI questions that chief executives need to focus on. These questions will likely evolve a bit, but for now they're providing direction for how we're developing the AI Playground and how DMOs are moving forward with AI integration. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? I would love to hear your feedback on any the above and how we can make the ESTO 2025 AI Playground as valuable as possible for you and your teams. Reach out at greg@matadornetwork.com . Greg Oates

Visit Mesa CEO Launches New AI Roadmap Aug 25 Written By Greg Oates Visit Mesa in Arizona kicked off a new internal initiative this week to integrate AI processes and platforms across the organization. I worked with Visit Mesa to help develop their new DMO AI Roadmap, which provides a 5-phase strategic framework that most any visitor organization can use as a template. The project officially began this week during Visit Mesa’s spring board meeting to communicate why the organization is moving forward with AI to optimize the DMO’s value for Mesa’s visitor industry and the local community. Marc Garcia, CATP , president and CEO of Visit Mesa, has been eager to start this initiative. He was one of the dozen CEOs who contributed to the first GuideGeek Destination AI story a few months back, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI. For that deep dive into a CEO's mindset regarding AI, Garcia asked: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” The Visit Mesa DMO AI Roadmap answers those questions. “I've recognized that AI is extremely important not only for the world moving forward, but specifically for our industry,” Garcia explained at the beginning of this project. “We at Visit Mesa need to get out in front of it. Even as a small to medium-sized DMO with our budget, we've always taken pride in the fact that we’re typically at the forefront of the latest and greatest in terms of technology, and so this is just an extension of that.” The following is a high-level overview of the DMO AI Roadmap and each of the five phases. However, like all strategic planning, there is a big jump between developing a plan and executing it effectively. This is especially true with internal AI training. In any given organization today, there is often a wide breadth of how people perceive AI and how proficient they are with AI models. It will take time to educate and align everyone around shared benefits for the organizations and staff, expected processes, intended outcomes and success metrics. Visit Mesa AI Roadmap The DMO AI Roadmap is a structured, phased approach for educating staff and integrating AI across DMO departments. The goals for the roadmap are to optimize internal operations, enhance sales and marketing outcomes, inspire staff self-learning, future-proof the organization, and contribute to how well local industry and community leaders adopt AI best practices and benefit from them. There are two imperatives that should be established and agreed upon among leadership at the very beginning. Integrating AI processes and platforms is an imperative for the DMO to ensure its relevancy and long-term impact in the local visitor economy. If leadership doesn’t fully believe that, this strategic framework won’t work. AI proficiency is an imperative for staff members for their future growth and marketability. That said, you can’t really force people to embrace, learn and use AI intentionally, but the job market will. The following phases are highly fluid and some of the processes can be rolled out concurrently. Ultimately, these phases provide structure for effectively and responsibly implementing a new technology that has no precedent. Because of generative AI, machines can now do three things they haven’t been able to do before. They have the ability to reason, the ability to communicate, and the ability to generate stuff based on that reasoning and communication. Meaning, AI is messy. Integrating it into our daily workflows is also messy because it's challenging us to rethink our relationship with technology. But as Kate Yordi, director of marketing at Visit Mesa, said during the board meeting this week, “Finally, we have some direction.” Phase 1: Leadership Alignment & Staff Communication As discussed at length in previous Destination AI posts, the DMO CEO must make it clear to all staff that the organization prioritizes AI because the organization prioritizes being relevant. It certainly helps, as is the case with Visit Mesa, when the CEO is fully backed by the board to invest in AI integration. During the board meeting, one member asked, “What do you need from us, Marc?” That’s a good sign. For the DMO AI Roadmap to work, all leadership needs to not only have a basic understanding of AI tools, they need to actually use them as well on a regular basis. That goes a long way in driving agency across the organization. However, making that happen typically requires some C-suite training to explain the primary AI models more indepth: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot and/or Google Gemini depending on the specific workplace platform(s) the organization uses. Identifying and prioritizing just a handful of AI models like that brings a lot of clarity to the process right off the bat. You see people's shoulders relax when they're confronted with 5-6 AIs versus dozens. (Yes, VEED, Gamma, Manus, Sora, Granola, Slack AI, etc., are all really cool but let's not start there.) A common lament among DMO leadership related to AI is, “Where do we even start?” Leadership should then discuss and begin to answer the five big questions all CEOs face when navigating AI integration, as vetted in the aforementioned Destination AI post about what CEOs want regarding AI education: How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI (who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI) to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and quality of work? How do we redevelop our content and channels to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI for business purposes to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The next step in this phase, at a basic level, is communicating to staff why they’re being asked to embrace AI. The following is not meant to be comprehensive, but a CEO would likely want to articulate: The purpose of the AI Roadmap, guiding principles, and the phases and processes involved How AI integration will take time and people will evolve at different paces It’s ok if everyone feels like they’re building the plane while flying it Everyone is encouraged to use AI and will be supported, but there will also be guardrails in place AI adoption and use cases will become part of employee reviews, but traditional roles, responsibilities and key success metrics are still the priority "How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents." — Marc Garcia, president and CEO, Visit Mesa Phase 2: Staff Assessment & AI Task Force Sitting down and asking staff how they feel about AI and how/if they’re using it is a good way to begin. Depending on the size of the organization, this can be done with every staff member individually or a representative group from each department. Generally people fall into three camps when it comes to AI: 1) Those who are already using AI on a regular basis; 2) those who are curious and have experimented a bit, but they don’t actively engage with AI tools; and 3) those who don’t see much value in AI. This last group can also include people who outright oppose AI, but they make themselves apparent pretty quickly. Data also shows there is often a significant percentage of staff who use AI in secret because they’re not sure they’re allowed to use it for work purposes. The second way to collect staff sentiment and AI capacity is with a blind online survey asking everyone what they like about AI, what concerns them, how they feel about job security, what they want to learn, what they hope to achieve, etc. Everything is anonymous so you can expect a wide variety of feedback ranging from constructive/optimistic to fears of an impending robot apocalypse. Once complete, all the data should be synthesized into key takeaways for leadership and shared with staff to show a high level of transparency right from the beginning of this process. The second part of this phase is developing an AI task force. The value of this cannot be overemphasized. Choose a small group of AI champions from various departments to do three things: Provide direction for stewarding the various processes in each phase as effectively as possible from beginning to end Share constructive and thoughtful input they’re hearing from other staff members about how things are proceeding well and where there are challenges Help scale AI adoption across teams by showing how they’re using AI effectively to everyone else in the organization An internal AI task force or council is invaluable because the members are motivated and they want to learn. Mostly, their enthusiasm and success with AI will begin to rub off on many of their colleagues and inspire self-learning and greater adoption among the teams. But not all. There will be those who disengage, and there can be a significant number of them. Over time, they should be consulted to understand their trepidation, which should then be addressed. This is a challenge I'm having with one organization where a significant cohort are saying they're too busy to learn AI. Meanwhile, the majority of the staff are reporting daily usage with effective results, which definitely wasn't the case a few months ago. And even with those leaning in, the level of improvement and AI Iearning will be slow at times. This is why it’s critical for the CEO and the rest of management to be all-in and consistently participate in staff training sessions to show direction, intention and support. It’s very easy for the novelty of AI training to wear off after the first few months. This is where the AI task force can be instrumental to help maintain overall staff interest and keep engagement levels as high as possible. "Finally, we have some direction." — Kate Yordi, director of marketing, Visit Mesa Phase 3: AI Policy & Investments Developing an official AI policy and governance manual accomplishes two primary objectives: It protects the organization against legal and financial liability by establishing how all employees are required to use AI responsibly. It encourages and gives license for staff to proactively experiment with AI because there are clear guidelines in place about how to do so. There are many DMOs who have created AI policies and are willing to share with the rest of the industry. These are typically not lengthy documents (3-4 pages) nor full of legalese. Generally they’re written so every single employee can understand everything in them. Sections in these policies often include: Positioning/Purpose Statement: Expresses how and why the organization needs to be intentional about implementing AI processes Primary Objectives and Intended Outcomes: Defines the business case for how the organization is attempting to deliver on its core mandate of driving revenue to local businesses in alignment with community priorities Guiding Principles: Establishes the principles of responsible AI use in alignment with the values of the organizations related to themes such as inclusivity, bias, authenticity, veracity, collaboration, knowledge sharing, etc. AI Definitions: Provides clear explanations of AI terminology used in the document and workplace AI Tools: Identifies specific AI models that the organization provides access to Data Input: Dictates clear rules about what employees can upload into AI models and what they can’t upload, such as personal information of any person Monitoring: Defines how the organization reserves the right to monitor AI practices Training & Support: Defines opportunities for professional growth and learning AI on an ongoing basis There are other items that DMOs might include in the above list, and they vary depending on how HR, financial and legal departments interpret AI governance, but it serves as a foundation. One key consideration for DMO leadership when it comes to policy is identifying which pro AI models to invest in. Paid AI tools provide higher levels of privacy and security because AI companies don’t train on them, or at least there’s the choice to select that option. Many DMOs, for example, purchase annual subscriptions for paid ChatGPT Team accounts ($25 per employee monthly) for staff to use for work, which is a first step for protecting the IP and other interests of the organization. Other paid AI models are then provided to specific departments based on need and the specific attributes of the tools, such as Claude for marketing and social media staff because many consider it the best AI for content creation. Phase 4: AI Education & Implementation This is the most important thing in training teams to embrace and use AI effectively. You want to foster an environment where structured learning evolves into self-learning. That’s the only way this scales. When staff members with little experience in AI start exploring how to use AI on their own, and they start helping their colleagues see new ways to use AI, that’s a pretty special thing. From an education standpoint, the DMO AI Roadmap begins at a high level defining AI’s place in online history. AI is the third transformational shift since the PC was invented, including: The mainstream web/internet in the 1990s; the evolution of mobile/social/cloud and apps in the 2000s; and gen AI in the 2020s. These are the only three times when big tech went all-in and pivoted their business models around a new technology. I then break AI training into the following buckets, and again, this is all very surface level and not meant to be comprehensive. Also, creating engaging demos are everything, and that's not also easy because AI demos can be a real slog sometimes. But, showing how different AIs provide real value is key for people to internalize their learning and use it more intuitively over time: Explain how pre-gen AI tech is deterministic and gen AI is probabilistic, which messes with a lot of people’s minds. Gen AI outputs are based on statistical patterns and probabilities, just like the human brain processes ideas and information. Traditional tech is based on absolutes, delivering the same output based on the same input. Old tech is about information. AI is about knowledge. Spend a lot of time on this with workshops and demos. Highlight the capabilities of only three AI models to start: ChatGPT for brainstorming and planning; Claude for writing and data analysis; and Perplexity for conversational search. The other two, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, are more general purpose. They also do amazing things (Gemini 2.5 Pro is great for reasoning), but focusing on the first three will provide direction at the beginning so people don’t get overwhelmed. At the very minimum, leadership should have a basic understanding of those three. Explain how AI search isn't 100% perfect but it's a 1,000% better than old search. Define how DMOs and all brnads are redesigning their websites and content strategy to optimize for AI search, and the basics of AI SEO . I would argue the most important thing for using AI is really understanding how generative AI = conversational AI. It's a dialogue. It's called "chat" for a reason. This is where I’ve heard the most positive feedback from teams I’ve worked with. It happens when people move beyond the Google mindset—where search is one and done—and they see the real value of iterative conversations with AI models that evolve with each exchange in the discussion, just like a human conversation. This also removes some misperceptions about how to prompt. Yes, there are some basic rules about how to prompt well. But beyond that, it’s vastly more beneficial to explore AI conversations further with thoughtful follow-up prompts that flow logically and organically to achieve the best results. Explore how the real value of AI extends beyond just efficiency and productivity gains. That's a dangerous dialogue with staff who can construe that as leading to more work or being terminated over time. The bigger value and better narrative is how AI increases creativity and knowledge, and how those both influence overall quality of work, marketing effectiveness, sales productivity, staff culture and pride, job satisfaction and growth opportunities, etc. Really dig into the advanced features of the paid models: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro. Aside from the added security and privacy they provide, they offer functions not available in the free models and their outputs are significantly better. ChatGPT Projects and custom GPTs, Claude Projects and Perplexity Spaces are where the magic happens. Create an environment where staff members are eager to share their successes with AI with the rest of the organization. This feedback loop is critical for steering education and driving adoption, and it’s one of the most important roles for the internal AI task force. AI-training meetings can be highly effective during video calls but they often have the greatest impact during in-person workshops. Also, make sure to give staff a specific amount of hours during the week to develop their AI skills. Explore options for AI chat platforms and the benefits they provide for visitors and local industry partners. I work with Matador Network, which developed the industry leading GuideGeek AI chat platform. The feedback from 35+ DMO clients is impressive and irrefutable, but there is still much work to do educating visitors and industry about AI chat strategy and their benefits to continually increase adoption and business outcomes. The DMO AI Roadmap also provides guidance for developing various learning and engagement formats: Schedule weekly or bi-weekly meetings specifically, and only, for AI training with both internal and external people sharing insights Create a library of AI educational materials for staff to reference Start a weekly internal AI newsletter to share how teams are using AI Start a Slack or similar channel dedicated for AI education, AI news updates, knowledge sharing, etc Start a weekly and optional one-hour AMA meeting for everyone to ask everyone else questions (highly effective) Create a regular schedule for staff to report back to leadership or department heads about how they’re using AI and what they’re achieving with it Phase 5: Success Tracking I kick off every AI presentation identifying the three AI models mentioned above—ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity—followed by the assertion that, "AI is the death of 'I don't know.'" That is arguably the biggest ROI for integrating AI in a DMO or any other type of organization. There are few questions that are too complex or too intimidating for DMO staff to approach with confidence and conviction if they know how to use those three AI models effectively. I shared an example previously where I used Perplexity Pro to educate myself about how board governance is evolving . That for me was something I knew was out of my realm of expertise, but now I feel I can speak with some semblance of authority about that to any board because of AI. Before gen AI, I dismissed board governance as one of those things I'd just have to leave in the dark. That said, trying to explain how AI helps staff become more self-reliant, where they can always build a foundation of understanding for anything to empower themselves, only goes so far with a board. They're looking for more quantitative KPIs. Here are just some examples of that in a DMO context. In 2025, defining KPIs for AI integration is an evolving science, and we as an industry are still figuring a lot of this out. Therefore, this list is nowhere near comprehensive and it will evolve, but we have ample data today to validate the following: Using AI for search and content development saves significant time and increases opportunities for higher output and increased creativity for producing blog posts, social media, videos, marketing campaigns, etc. Developing custom GPTs (in ChatGPT Plus) for group sales is a proven strategy for creating better, more customized proposals in much less time. That gives sales staff more time for brainstorming and prospecting leading to higher production. That's a fact. In this case, group sales people are actually pumped to try a new technology. Using AI for regression analysis and scenario modeling increases the accuracy of how DMOs predict visitor volumes year-round, event attendance, economic impact, etc. One of the biggest conversations in DMOs today is how to develop content and websites to rank higher in AI search. Developing best practices in AI SEO leads to higher traffic. That is a core mandate for any DMO, and no DMO can afford to ignore that over time. AI chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI are driving real business. As described in PhocusWire in March, New York City Tourism + Conventions launched its GuideGeek-powered "Ellis" meeting-specific AI chat in January. ROI to date: 100% increase in traffic to the meeting planner website, 800+ AI-driven queries in the first month, 50% growth in newsletter sign-ups, and 10% increase in time spent on the site. Summary The AI train has left the station and it's gaining steam. The DMO AI Roadmap is the next logical step for helping DMO CEOs and their teams integrate AI processes and platforms. As Visit Mesa's Kate Yordi said, "Finally, we now have direction." That's a big deal for DMO staff to feel that way. Generative AI has been with us for more than two years now, but a structured and phased approach for integrating AI across DMO departments has been the missing piece. Visit Mesa's DMO AI Roadmap is going to evolve as the team works through the process, but at least now there's a vision and scope. Visit Mesa CEO Marc Garcia and the board are fully committed—a critical first step for embarking on this journey. Also, this strategic framework for how DMOs approach AI is going to underpin the interactive AI Playground activation at U.S. Travel's upcoming ESTO conference in Phoenix, August 17-19. U.S. Travel and GuideGeek are partnering to develop educational programming for the hands-on AI training experience and series of thought leadership. Greg Oates

How AI Improves DMO and Community Master Planning Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Many DMOs are developing 10-year destination master plans to optimize their visitor economy in alignment with local community priorities. I've participated in producing dozens of them from Miami to Mesa. They often take as long as a year to complete because there's so much focus on community engagement in various formats: interviews, focus groups, town halls, surveys, visioning sessions, etc. The tourism industry talks about the importance of community a LOT. However, when you're working with a DMO, you never really dig into what actually moves the needle across so many endless community demands, not on a tactical and hyperlocal level. You're not really held accountable for any measure of success when it comes to community-specific initiatives, ranging from improving City Hall permitting processes for small businesses to tracking the movement of unhoused. A master plan needs to address those and amplify those kinds of pressing needs for the destination overall. The expectation is not really to fix them. That’s not the role of a DMO. It's a whole different ballgame when you're developing a long-term strategic framework for a community organization like Near Southside, Inc . in Fort Worth. Success and being accountable for fixing things is expected. Located at the periphery of the downtown core, Near Southside is the most interesting community in North America right now. The ex-industrial district can be loosely compared to Austin 20 years ago with the same cultural DNA and similar community values, based on a fiercely protective love for local, creative and independently owned small businesses. That's under threat. In the last few years, as Near Southside evolved into the coolest 'hood east and west of the Pecos Line, real estate prices are rising commensurately. We all know how this story often ends with the encroachment of national brands sanitizing the soul of a place that made it attractive in the first place. Near Southside is intent on rewriting that story. AI Processes for Strategic Planning Here's where AI comes in. Because of the multitude of overlapping challenges and evolving dynamics in the community, our team needs to crunch and debate a ton of qualitative and quantitative data. Addressing gentrification touches on so many aspects of how communities operate. Therefore, we are over-indexing on community engagement to get as many perspectives as possible to identify how the community best evolves in the face of rapid change. The amount of inputs we're getting is substantive, and we want to inventory all of it as thoroughly as possible to build a super comprehensive knowledge base for the AI to cull through, connect dots and output insights. Every individual zoom call with stakeholders is recorded with Granola AI, which produces full transcripts but the summaries are too light. So we created custom GPTs with instructions for everything we want in the summaries, including comprehensive overviews, key takeaways with detailed context for each, the most insightful quotes related to those takeaways, and all action items that stakeholders recommended. With the GPT, we can fire full transcripts into the chat, press "enter" and receive highly valuable, high quality and uniform summaries almost immediately. We're doing the same with the focus groups but the custom GPTs require a different set of instructions. The two-hour transcripts capture the conversations with 10-20 stakeholders convened across specific industry and community segments. For those, the GPTs bucket corresponding high-level takeaways and tactical action items related to the same theme. That has immeasurable value because these conversations are all over the place. It's great working with locals who are so passionate about where they live and how, but that means you're getting feedback from a firehose and someone taking notes doesn’t capture all the nuance. Using custom GPTs to produce these summaries and populate takeaways is as good or better than any team could do manually. Everything is stored in Airtable. Forget Google or Microsoft cloud platforms. Airtable is an AI-powered, relational database/spreadsheet beast for organizing data and automating basic workflows. The tables combine all project information in one place, such as a running list of pending/completed interviews and focus groups and their AI-generated summaries. Airtable can then auto-generate a summary of the summary in the same table for clients to easily review everything being collected on a daily basis to whatever degree they prefer. Once you use Airtable, you'll never look at Google Drive the same way again. I've never had so many insights so well organized, so thorough and so easy to share with a team and client to help inform each project phase. The client loves the transparency, immediacy and structure, naturally, versus waiting for the next weekly update to read a few bullet points in a PowerPoint. Here's the thing. Because we've been so intentional about collecting such a high quality and comprehensive volume of feedback, we have a motherlode of a knowledge base for AI to work with. We can then enter all that in bulk into Google NotebookLM or ChatGPT/Claude Projects to pull out anything from high-level aggregate takeaways to anything super customized or tactical. For example, the client was interested in hearing specifically just what developers had to say about gentrification. I wanted highlights related to anything discussed regarding City Hall processes. It’s super easy to pull reports together for those and anything else. Ultimately, you can use AI to deliver an outline, a strategy map and a very rough draft of a destination master plan. All you need to do is combine all of the above together, plus PDFs of all relevant public and private planning documents, PDFs of all relevant case studies and best practices, and detailed instructions about the purpose, elements, structure, etc., of the plan. People will disagree, sure. I'm not dismissing the expertise of people who put these things together, because they bring deep context to every conversation and decision made during the development of a master plan. Everything happening now in Near Southside has happened somewhere else. When you can bring takeaways from those places to any present situation, it helps provide direction for everyone in the room. Again, I’m not saying that AI is replacing humans. People get all kinds of worked up over that, especially in travel and tourism. I am saying you can create a better, more strategic and more informed master plan in a much more streamlined fashion when you employ AI strategically to better prepare a community for the future. That's just a fact. I have four more community focus groups today in Near Southside. The expectation among everyone is that their contributions will make a demonstrable difference in their neighborhood. We can’t just speak to the challenges. We need to fix them and our processes with AI are giving everyone more confidence that we can deliver on that. Wondering how many DMOs are interested in employing similar AI-first strategies to get a better handle on how to help their communities. Greg Oates

How Visit Richmond is Using AI to Sell More Conventions Aug 2 Written By Greg Oates DMO CEOs want specific use cases for AI showing how they drive measurable business results. Here's a great example for capitalizing on AI to drive meetings and conventions volume from Lauran Peoples , director of sales marketing and business development at Visit Richmond in Virginia. Peoples works in the organization's 13-person sales team and reports to the VP of sales. Her role has three core functions: She is the main liaison between the destination sales and marketing departments; she develops and leads campaign strategy for the sales department; and she works with her colleagues to optimize strategic partnerships. Peoples' role is somewhat unique as a liaison between sales and marketing in that she lives on the sales side, versus marketing. She also stands out in our industry as an emerging voice in AI innovation. If you're going to U.S. Travel's ESTO conference this month in Phoenix, look for her and me working in the show's inaugural AI Playground educational activation. Greg Oates: Can you explain your role at Visit Richmond, specifically in terms of how you bridge the sales and marketing teams? Lauran Peoples: It's becoming more common in DMOs for sales teams to have a marketing liaison, but usually that person is based on the marketing team and is mostly assigned to sales to help with creative. The issue is when that marketing liaison is based on the marketing team, they don't have much exposure to the field and what's happening out of market with your salespeople. Our sales team has 45 trade shows this upcoming fiscal year, so they're traveling almost every week. With my situation in Richmond, they're getting real-time data and downloads about what's happening in each destination, so that gives them more authentic conversations to engage planners. Not having someone assigned to a team like that creates a huge disconnect and leaves opportunity on the table. GO: Tell us a little about your journey with AI. LP: I've been working in hospitality for 20 years. Last year, I heard some younger people on the team talking about ChatGPT. So I was like, okay, I don't know anything about that. I went to PCMA Convening Leaders in January and the opening session was all about AI. I remember sitting there feeling like a dinosaur. Feeling very behind. I realized this is a lot more serious and widespread than I thought, so I left and tasked myself with using ChatGPT once a day. Initially, I couldn't differentiate how it wasn't like Google. I was asking it how many tablespoons are in this or that, kind of thing. Since then, my understanding of AI has progressively increased around more complex and comprehensive capabilities. It has streamlined my productivity, but more importantly, AI has become a thought partner for me to bounce all these ideas and scenarios around that I didn't have before. I think that a lot of people are adopting AI and using it as a communications assistant, or a writing assistant. But the part for me that's really exciting and valuable with AI is analyzing and aggregating data and getting it to show you things that you need help with, like sales. GO: Can you share an example? LP: Sure. I took five datasets: five years of lost business, five years of definite business, and three marketing reports from different campaigns we were running with outside agencies like Sojourn and Digital Edge. Those campaigns give us demographic insights because we were targeting certain areas. I also grabbed our sales deployment sheet, which tells you who has what market. I uploaded all of those into ChatGPT and asked it to identify the top five locations for each of our managers based on their market segments. Some results weren't surprising, but there were a few that popped up like Orlando that we've never traditionally considered. When I asked ChatGPT why Orlando, it showed how the city has a large hobby market. It turns out there are a lot of hobby conventions that meet in Orlando. After I compiled the top five locations for each manager, I asked ChatGPT to give me the top five accounts in each of those locations. Then I asked for unique selling propositions for each of those accounts as to why Richmond would be a perfect fit. Finally, I asked it to rank those five destinations based on probability of success. GO: Have you seen any of this result in new business opportunities? LP: Yes. One location that showed up was Philadelphia. Richmond is four hours from Philadelphia, but like Orlando it hasn't typically been on our radar. However, based on the data from ChatGPT, Philly came up as a recommendation. So we sent one of our sales managers to Philadelphia, and she ended up hosting 18 planners, including some who drove from over an hour away to see her. She got such a great response that I had to jump in and go with her because she couldn't host 18 clients by herself. AI has now informed our sales strategy for Philly, and the region is now part of our dedicated sales strategy. We've allocated funds for that sales manager in Philly to join chapters of organizations like MPI and PCMA. So that's how we know there had to be some accuracy to our approach with AI. GO: How do the sales managers feel about you doing this AI analysis? LP: They appreciate it. It's a balance because most sales managers at DMOs aren't entry level; they've been in hospitality for a long time. This is a new process and a new tool for them. Some have destinations they like to go to over and over because they're successful there. But my role is to support business enablement and sales enablement to help them do what they do better and uncover new business. So how we're using AI provides them with additional actionable research. GO: I think one of the most underrated strategies for AI is developing custom GPTs in ChatGPT to help sales teams develop more customized and effective proposals more quickly. Are you building those at all? LP: Yes, definitely. About a month and a half ago, I programmed a GPT for the sales team called "Prospecting Partner." It's trained on our sales collateral and all our information, so it knows our convention packages and understands our jurisdiction and seven localities. The sales managers have been using it to prospect smarter. I included suggested prompts to go beyond just, "Give me a prospecting email." We can get really specific, like, "Help me re-engage an association planner who just lost grant funding." It also provides strategies specifically related to that, and then you can ask how to execute those strategies. So, for example, we know from reports that finance and insurance is an opportunity market for us. It's a small percentage of our current business but it has the highest average daily rate, which makes it very attractive to our hotel partners. So our salespeople are asking ChatGPT for ways we can develop business in the finance and insurance market, and really dig into that. Ultimately, AI is helping our sales team think bigger, smarter and more strategically. I've asked the sales team if they found this helpful, and, you know, salespeople are not an easy crowd. They said yes across the board. With the ChatGPT Enterprise version, I can't see their exact prompts due to privacy, but I can see the number of conversations they're having with the tool, so I know they're actively using it. GO: How are other people on your team using AI? LP: My two direct reports are our CRM database administrator and our sales coordinator. My sales coordinator does support work for the entire team, so she's using ChatGPT a lot for ideation, like when a sales manager needs an itinerary to entertain clients in Chicago. My CRM database administrator uses ChatGPT as a communication assistant because sometimes analytical personality types can benefit from exploring more communication nuances. She's also started incorporating it into data cleanup, using it to analyze reports and suggest what's missing or what would be beneficial. She uses it to help fill in gaps and identify what's not being asked or said. GO: What are some of your future plans with AI? LP: We're launching microsites for destination sales and sports, and I think it will set a model for the rest of the organization because we’re replacing our website from pre- to post-AI, like most DMO sites these days. We're currently writing copy for the microsites, and I've been getting into structured data and semantic clarity. You don't search ChatGPT or prompt ChatGPT with the same language you search Google, so content has to be written differently. Previously, you'd go to Google and say "restaurants near me." Now with ChatGPT, it's more of a conversation, so you'll say, "Hey, I'm in Scott's Addition historic district in Richmond with my kids, and we're looking for a vegan restaurant." That semantic clarity allows AI to respond with much more specific answers. I think we need to anticipate AI searches, as opposed to Google searches, in how we write content. Everyone is subconsciously expecting a personally curated experience today. When I go on Amazon, I'm expecting it to make connections that I like this, so I might also like this, without me having to tell it certain things. That's where we have to move towards, or we get eclipsed or become obsolete, especially if we're just thinking of ourselves as brokers for a destination. Greg Oates

Visit Phoenix CEO on Leading AI Strategy and Being Chill About It Jul 28 Written By Greg Oates I learned a lot about how DMO leaders can confidently integrate AI processes into their organizations after speaking with Ron Price, CDME, president and CEO of Visit Phoenix. Price is somewhat new to AI but his staff have been doing cool things with various LLMs for a while. He says his primary role with AI is providing the Visit Phoenix team with an enabling environment for success built on a culture of trust. Price accomplishes that by inspiring everyone to experiment with AI, be aware of the liabilities, share their wins, have fun with it, reach out to others for advice, and most of all, validate everything. Although, what stood out for me the most talking with Price is his calm and clear approach to AI, basically inferring (in my words, not his)... "We got this. We might do something amazing today with AI or we might not, but either way we're fully committed to seeing what it can do. We're also going to figure this AI thing out by collaborating with our many DMO industry friends. Because AI is going to change everything in a hurry, and we at Visit Phoenix are not going to be caught staring out at a Sonoran sunset while the world passes our city by." That's the vibe I got. That's leadership. That's what being a CEO means, at least for me. AI is confusing, sure, and CEOs have to worry about their boards and electeds. The thing is, we're more than two and a half years into generative AI now, and it's not going to wait for CEOs to decide if they can "trust AI" or not. I think we can all learn from Price a few things: We can de-escalate all the hubris and hand-wringing surrounding AI by being open to possibilities and having a clear set of principles, especially related to responsible AI use and verification. You can have fun with AI and focus on business outcomes at the same time. The DMO industry needs to collaborate and share best practices more intentionally to accelerate AI education, innovation and integration. We must encourage DMO staff to use AI today so they can steer the future of our industry tomorrow. Price likes talking about AI. I would encourage any DMO CEOs on the fence with AI to reach out to him. Greg Oates: Ron, how do you use AI? Ron Price: I use AI every single day, going back now about a month and a half. I'm just fascinated and interested in what it's able to do. I wouldn't say I'm an early adopter, of course, although there are some people who aren't even on it yet. Me personally, I use it for everything, like if I'm curious about something that's happening within the region. Or maybe I want to quickly compile a lot of data to help solve a problem or answer questions as I get ready for different meetings. More or less, my brain is always just firing, like, "What if we tried this or that?" And so, this year has been a cool realization about what AI can do, and seeing how it's pulling all the sources through to validate what it responds with. We have also integrated AI with Microsoft Copilot. We pay for everyone to have access to that, and then we also have a ChatGPT Team account for our staff. GO: Where else are you seeing value with AI at Visit Phoenix? RP: In our world, it's marketing, it's content. I love being surrounded by people who can write really well. It's an art to me, and I don't possess that art. It's like someone playing the piano. I'm in awe of that. So AI gives people the ability to write better, and it's okay to lean into it. Don't feel threatened by it. AI is able to give you that one golden nugget, or it suggests that one good idea that can really help someone when they're writing. Here's the fun part. Every day, we're learning something unique. We have the Cronkite School of Journalism in Phoenix, and some of the students are here. We kind of give them free rein, and we're also teaching them at the same time. The way that they use AI is amazing. It's fun to walk down the hall to see them because I'm always like, "How did you write that? How did you create that image? How did you pull that data and research together?" It's just a different generation. We're also seeing where our people are asking AI things like, "If I'm a salesperson, how do I influence a group to come here in the middle of the summer for a conference? Why is it fun to be here for a conference when it's 110 degrees out?" And what does AI have to say? Well, one thing that's great about, say, Grok, for example, it's pulling from all these little texts on Twitter, or X. They're from people saying, "Hey, I know it's summertime in Phoenix but look what I got to do." Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use. GO: Does your staff using AI increase your organization's impact in the community? RP: We not only focus on growing tourism in our community, but we're also joined at the hip with economic development. We look at our role as we're here to build a better community through tourism. And so, when you think about utilizing all the data out there, we always ask ourselves, "How could AI help us consolidate that data and crunch the numbers faster to give us a clearer picture of what we think we know?" For example, how much business that comes in through our leads touch our priority sectors? And of those sectors, which ones align extremely well with what we're doing here at Visit Phoenix? Is it semiconductors? Is it bio-med? Is it something that leans into the engineering side because of what ASU and the Department of Defense are doing? We've seen we can go back and look at the data and get a better picture of those things now. Also, as an example, we have a high propensity to book business around the semiconductor space. So we're utilizing these AI tools to quickly do research like, "Give me a list of the top semiconductor conferences that take place around the world." The responses are quicker and the results are better versus doing a traditional Google search. It's able to pull from a lot of different sources, so that's another way we're using AI. “Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use.” GO: How do you define the role of a CEO to guide a DMO forward with AI? RP: Setting up the rules of the game is important. There are areas of liability we have to be aware of about what you can and can't be pulling in. Those are the types of things we needed to figure out, you know, basically, "What is our rule book for using AI?" I like giving people the ability to use AI as they will. I think it works best whenever people know that it's a tool we want them to utilize. And if it can help us at the end of the day tell a better story, be smarter as we go after business, and be smarter with our analytics to help build our marketing strategy stronger, then use it. I try to build a team of leaders so they're CEOs of their own divisions, and I want them to be thought leaders in their areas. Also, I think AI enables us to get to answers quickly, but, and this is important, how do we validate those answers? We're really good at Visit Phoenix when it comes to validating answers, but we're usually doing it by going the long way and understanding how AI responded like it did. We're reading source by source by source, and then we kind of come to our own conclusion. It's like we're not just focused on the punch line of a joke. We can also tell you the structure of the joke. You always have to validate. We get excited about using AI because it just puts us in a new position. I think it's good to have a CEO that supports that, but that support comes from a trust within the organization. I trust that people are going to utilize AI to help make us better. GO: What keeps you up at night regarding AI? RP: My fear is how do we control and ensure that someone isn't producing something negative on our behalf, and then launching it to the world, and using this incredible tool to hurt us? Because there are people that are extremely gullible who believe whatever they're looking at. That's kind of where my brain goes sometimes. It's only because of what I've already seen these tools can do. I think across the DMO industry, we'll have some "ahas," especially when we get together in various forums to exchange ideas. We need to be talking with each other about, "Here are some things that work really well with AI, and here are the headwinds." And then, "These are the things you need to realize could happen with AI, and here are some ways you can mitigate those problems." The more we can learn from others about how they're using AI, the better. I think what you're putting together about AI strategy with all your insights is going to be extremely valuable. GO: Thank you. So, what are you thinking about next with AI? RP: As AI continues to grow, and we've talked about it here internally, what is the value of a website? In fact, we just started our next fiscal year, July 1. Website visits is no longer a key metric that we're going after. As a leader, I like knowing what's three steps ahead. We currently have these tools, but how are they going to change the way we make decisions going forward? At some point, a lot of what we're talking about now is going to be white noise. And what then? It doesn't mean our jobs of promoting a destination change. It means we're going to get so much better at telling our story through so many different avenues. I believe that our reach is actually going to broaden. We're still going to be responsible for promoting our destination and selling our destination, but how we tell the story and how we show the story is going to change as these tools evolve. Back in the day, a lot of us were reading about Moore's Law and how things just keep improving and getting cheaper, especially in technology. Now we're moving into a space where the rate of growth with AI is going to be something we've never seen before. Greg Oates

German Convention Bureau Leader on the Future of AI-Powered Meetings Jul 27 Written By Greg Oates After the global financial crisis ended in 2011, a few cities and nations around the world began promoting themselves to meeting and convention organizers based on their intellectual capital, versus venues and attractions. Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau (GCB), led this strategy in Europe at the time. Around the same year, I was visiting the House of Logistics & Mobility (HOLM) think tank in Frankfurt. The GCB suggested I visit there to better understand this new direction for attracting high-value business events in advanced industries. "The city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," Dr. Stefan Walter told me, who was a professor at HOLM at the time. "So, this [GCB] strategy is about finding the strengths of our strengths, our core competencies, and for Germany, that’s knowledge and infrastructure. It’s also about connecting ideas.” That has been my due north working in the travel industry ever since. This idea that meeting planners and attendees can tap into a deep knowledge base in a host destination, specific to their interests, for me, is intoxicating. The challenge is it takes a ton of work connecting local leaders in specific advanced industries, like aviation in Frankfurt or e-mobility in Stuttgart, with large global organizations in those same industries and convince them to bring their big annual event to Germany. It's also pretty high level. From an attendee standpoint, if I'm in Hamburg and want to learn about HafenCity, the largest urban makeover in Europe, it's not like I can easily access a bunch of people and organizations leading the future of urban development. Which, would be cool, right? AI is helping make that a reality. Germany's national Open Data/Knowledge Graph project is an ambitious AI-powered initiative to build a massive network of industry suppliers, academic organizations and business leaders across the country. Basically, by indexing the visitor industry and intellectual capital supply chain, Germany can connect the brightest minds in Germany with the rest of the world more seamlessly, effectively and equitably. An "interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," if you will. I spoke with Mr. Schultze to learn more about how AI is impacting the meetings and convention industry in Germany. Greg Oates: How is AI evolving across Germany's visitor industry? Specifically, how are your municipal CVBs and other partners thinking about and using AI right now? Matthias Schultze: Like much of the world, things really accelerated for us around two years ago with the rise of tools like ChatGPT. Suddenly, everyone, from corporates to associations, started thinking seriously about AI. We saw an opportunity and created an innovation platform called ebx.lab . It’s a peer-to-peer learning community for event planners, where we partner with scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute to explore how AI might reshape the business events space. From those early sessions, we have published a few white papers and identified a few core insights. AI clearly has potential to personalize experiences, optimize event planning processes, improve engagement and networking, and maybe most exciting, support predictive analytics. That last one, especially, being able to anticipate trends or behaviors based on data, is what feels most transformative to me personally. GO: How is the GCB embracing AI internally? MS: We developed our own internal AI strategy for the German Convention Bureau. We wanted to give both our team and our stakeholders a shared framework, something that outlined where we are today, where we want to go, and how we get there. It’s called "Driven by People, Powered by Data," and that title really reflects our belief that AI is a tool, not a solution in itself. People need to lead the process. The strategy helps us clarify not just what we can do with AI, but also what we can’t or shouldn’t do, at least not yet. It outlines our roadmap and aligns everyone across our organization and membership. GO: Is that strategy available publicly? MS: Yes, though only in German for now. But with the right AI tools, you can translate it quickly. The strategy touches on everything from marketing and communications to event planning, workflow automation, customer personalization, sustainability, and even ethics and compliance. The ethics component is particularly important. As exciting as AI is, we have to keep guardrails in place. Within our organization, we’re working hard to ensure that AI isn’t something siloed or limited to leadership. It needs to be embedded across every level. Everyone in the organization is expected to develop basic AI literacy. We’ve also worked on minimum viable products for things like dashboards and customer-facing chatbots. Some are already in use today. GO: You've always been a strong and vocal proponent for sustainability in business events. How is AI supporting you there? MS: I’m very proud of a project we developed with 29 other European countries: the Sustainability Hub for Events . It’s an AI-driven platform that brings together all kinds of sustainability related data—certifications, guidelines, best practices—and makes them accessible through an interactive AI agent. Planners can ask things like, “Can you help me build a sustainable menu?” or input event details to estimate their CO₂ footprint. It’s highly practical, and it’s making a real difference for event planners who need fast, reliable and actionable sustainability information. GO: We've talked about your Open Data and Knowledge Graph project in Germany numerous times in the past. Is that now live? MS: It’s technically live but still in progress, and probably always will be, in a sense. We’re continuously expanding it. The Open Data Germany project by the German National Tourist Board is live with its Knowledge Graph. The Open Data MICE project, which is implemented in close cooperation with the GNTB, is not yet live. One exciting element launching soon is an interactive map of research institutions in Germany. It will show where key research and innovation is taking place, including medical tech, renewable energy and so on, and link that data to infrastructure like hotels and conference venues. The idea is to visualize Germany as a knowledge landscape. If you’re planning an event and you want to anchor it around a theme like urban mobility, the map will show you which regions are most active in that field and match you with the relevant venues and experts. GO: One theme I keep obsessing about, and it's felt like a bit of a fantasy for more than a decade, is that the city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine. That idea is a direct quote from your House of Logistics and Mobility in Frankfurt, and it’s stuck with me ever since I heard it back in 2011. It's this idea of a city as a platform. Do you think we're getting closer to executing on this idea, where innovation at all levels is more accessible and shareable for more people? Ultimately what we're talking about here is the democratization of knowledge and excellence. MS: I love that idea. I really do. I think there are two layers to it. On one level, we have the smart city movement with systems that integrate transportation, energy, data and infrastructure to make better decisions. That’s already happening in many places across Europe. But on a deeper level, regarding your fantasy.... Let's say you could land in Munich, be interested in urban tech, and immediately connect with people, events and institutions aligned with that interest—that’s becoming possible too. The data already exists. It’s just scattered. But with open data standards, machine readability, and the right AI tools, we can start connecting those dots. Your fantasy city may not be so far off.

CONTENT:
A CEO's Playbook for AI Integration Oct 10 Written By Greg Oates Your competitors are talking about AI. Your board is asking about AI. Your partners want to see your AI strategy. Many DMOs are debating the potential of AI, while an increasing number of others are already extracting real business and organizational value. The difference isn't budget or technical talent. It's knowing exactly where to look for opportunities and how to scale what works. 3 Non-Negotiables You Must Lead This, Not Delegate It: AI transformation dies in committee. The organizations seeing real results have CEOs who champion specific initiatives, remove bureaucratic friction, and signal that AI adoption is a strategic priority. This doesn't mean micromanaging prompts. It means creating air cover for teams to experiment and fail fast. Complex Impresses, Simple Delivers: Your instinct will be to pursue the flashy, sophisticated AI applications that sound impressive in board presentations. Resist it. The organizations generating real ROI start with mundane problems: expense report processing, meeting summarization, competitive monitoring, etc. These boring use cases build organizational confidence and create the foundation for more ambitious projects. Your People Know Where the Problems Are: The best AI applications emerge from the intersection of daily frustration and technological possibility. Run hackathons. Create cross-functional workshops. Ask your teams what they do that feels like waste. The solutions they surface will be more practical and impactful than anything your consultants recommend. Start Here Stop looking for AI opportunities everywhere. Focus your organization's attention on three specific areas where AI creates immediate, measurable value. The Tedium Tax: Every role in your organization includes mind-numbing tasks that consume time without creating value: data entry, compliance documentation, procurement reports, staff vacation tracking, etc. Think of these as your "Anti To-Do List." These are tasks systematically eliminated by asking, "How can I never have to do this again?" Your teams are paying a tedium tax every day. AI is the refund. The Expertise Bottleneck: Projects stall when teams hit the limits of their skills and wait for other departments. Marketing needs data analysis and campaign design mockups. Finance and HR need custom GPTs. Sales needs meetings-related technical specifications translated into customer language. AI breaks these bottlenecks by giving every team superpowers they never had before. The Blank Page Problem: Knowledge work involves ambiguous challenges where the path forward isn't clear: Strategy development, market analysis, problem diagnosis, etc. AI excels at generating multiple approaches, analyzing incomplete information, and proposing next steps when your teams are stuck. It's the thinking partner that's always available and never runs out of ideas. 6 Use Cases OpenAI's analysis of 600+ successful implementations across various industries reveals that virtually every valuable AI application falls into one of six categories. Show your teams these six use cases and they'll start finding opportunities everywhere. Content Creation: Use AI for first drafts of everything: strategy documents, marketing campaigns, product and experience descriptions, customer and community communications. AI maintains your brand voice while eliminating the blank page problem. Research and Synthesis: AI powers information gathering at superhuman speed, including market analysis, competitive intelligence, customer feedback synthesis, regulatory research, etc.. AI doesn't just find information. It structures it exactly how you need it for decision-making. Coding for Everyone: Your non-technical teams can now write Python scripts, SQL queries, and data visualizations. Your engineering teams debug faster and prototype in unfamiliar languages. AI democratizes technical capability while accelerating your experts. Data Analysis Without Degrees: Upload spreadsheets, dashboard screenshots or raw data files and get structured analysis without requiring PhD-level statistics knowledge. This is arguably the most undervalued opportunity that delivers immediate results for most DMOs. Strategic Thinking Partner: AI is a beast for brainstorming, scenario planning, product and event development, asset mapping, risk analysis, etc. AI helps structure complex problems and identifies considerations your teams might miss. This is my favorite use case for AI. Intelligent Automation: Use platforms like n8n, Relay and others to create repeatable processes that run themselves, such as weekly competitive updates, financial reporting, sales and marketing workflows, a ton of admin duties, etc. Create the process once, then let AI handle the execution while humans focus on exceptions and strategy. Implementation is Where DMOs Fail Most AI initiatives fail because organizations treat them like traditional software deployments. They're not. AI is about change management and behavioral transformation up and down the org chart. AI implementation requires different approaches to discovery, prioritization and scaling. Systematic Opportunity Hunting: Don't wait for AI use cases to emerge organically. Run structured discovery sessions where teams audit their workflows for repetitive tasks, skill bottlenecks, and ambiguous challenges. Make this process ongoing, not a one-time exercise. The Impact-Effort Matrix: Not every AI opportunity deserves attention. Prioritize based on business impact versus implementation effort. Quick wins build momentum. High-value, high-effort projects become strategic investments. Everything else gets parked until technology makes it easier. Innovation as Culture: Internal competitions accelerate discovery while building AI literacy across your organization. The goal isn't technical sophistication. It's practical business solutions that teams actually want to use. Measure What Matters: Track time saved, accuracy improved, costs reduced and capability expansion. But also measure qualitative impacts: employee satisfaction, process improvements, competitive advantages. Use this data to guide scaling decisions. Build Your AI Process Move beyond random experimentation to systematic capability building. I like Estée Lauder's 5-phase process to ensure repeatable success with AI. Does this resonate with you for your DMO? Design: Define your purpose, scope and success criteria for AI integration in a 2-page brief. No scope creep. No technical complexity for its own sake. Prepare: Ask department heads to gather relevant data and best practices. AI tools should reflect organizational knowledge, not generic approaches. Build and Test: Hire contractors where necessary to help teams develop automations/agents, implement training, integrate datasets and validate accuracy. Focus on usability, not just functionality. Launch: Deploy with user guides and change management support. Technology deployment is easy. User adoption across all departments is a total headache at first. Optimize: Feedback loops drive continuous improvement based on actual usage patterns. AI applications evolve with business needs and improved capabilities. Key Insight: Always start with fundamental questions: Why build this? What problem does it solve? What impact will it have? Is the measurement for success quantitative or qualitative? Organizations that answer these questions clearly will build more successful AI applications than those focused primarily on technical capability. Build AI-Native Workflows The most sophisticated implementations integrate AI across entire business processes rather than individual tasks. This evolution positions organizations for the agentic AI capabilities coming next. Process Decomposition: Break complex workflows into constituent tasks, identify where each AI use case category adds value, and create integrated approaches spanning from research through execution. Marketing workflows might integrate research for market understanding, analysis for opportunity mapping, ideation for strategy, content creation for product and destination development, and automation for distribution. Cross-Functional Integration: AI facilitates better collaboration by translating between departments. Technical specifications become marketing language. Customer requirements inform sales priorities. Financial models drive strategic planning. Future-Proofing for Agents: Current workflow integration prepares your organization for AI agents that can complete entire projects independently. Teams that understand how to break processes into AI-addressable components will leverage these capabilities immediately when available. The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done. This cognitive shift creates advantages that compound over time and become increasingly difficult for competitors to replicate. "The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done." Key Takeaways The question isn't whether AI will transform our industry. It's whether you'll be leading that transformation or reacting to it. Start with clear, achievable use cases and systemic approaches to build the organizational muscle needed for transformation. AI advantage isn't about having the most technical teams or biggest budgets. It's about developing capabilities for organization-wide discovery, adoption, implementation and scaling of practical business solutions. The organizations moving beyond experimentation to systematic implementation today will be best positioned to leverage the more sophisticated AI capabilities emerging tomorrow. The agents are coming. Will you be ready? Greg Oates

The ROI of AI Agents Aug 21 Written By Greg Oates Based on a bunch of conversations at DI Annual 2025 this month, it's clear that many DMO executives still equate generative AI primarily with writing and editing in ChatGPT. But as one COO of a large U.S. DMO told me, "Surely there's more to all this than just learning about prompting." So many ways to respond to that. Meanwhile, there are also DMO leaders who established AI road maps for their organizations going back two years. For them, they're increasingly focused on developing AI-powered automated workflows and their more sophisticated cousins, AI agents. The purpose of these synthetic workflows is to automate tedious, time-consuming and repetitive tasks to free up staff to focus on more high-value work. Think of it as an evolution from using AI to building AI. You begin by visually mapping what people do in your organization. Then you identify where AI can potentially take over all the mundane stuff better and faster. I’ve been working with my colleagues at Matador Network to develop automated workflows for our Studio team. We have endless terabytes of client video created during the last 10 years. Now, with AI, we want to capitalize on those existing assets to create new video, but first we need to use AI to understand what we actually own. We contracted Erick Bonilla , founder of Pocho.tech based in Uruguay, to build a series of new AI workflows in n8n. One of the automations is designed to cull through 10 years of video files in Dropbox and catalogue everything in Airtable. The AI then creates standardized file names, project IDs, links for raw edited videos and finished client hero/cutdown videos, and location and content tags. The cost to develop the AI workflow was about $2,000 all-in, and it saved more than a month of work at a mid-level manager salary. The beauty of automations/agents is you can measure ROI annually fairly easily, which will help wake up your board if they're sleeping on AI. Moreover, once an automation is in place, the savings will continue to accrue in the future indefinitely for tasks still required, and there’s zero human error. During a staff Zoom, I asked members of our Studio team if they felt these new agents signaled to them the beginning of the end of some people’s jobs. The response was unanimous. Nobody wants to do this type of repetitive grunt work. I spoke with Bonilla for his take on the future of AI agents. Greg Oates: Erick, what services does Pocho.tech provide? Erick Bonilla: We identify opportunities within organizations of all sizes, where we believe implementing AI systems can dramatically improve the efficiency of operations. We can create workflows that process data, or we can create AI agents capable of reasoning, analyzing data, creating reports, and providing decision-makers with an enhanced way of digesting information. I have been doing this for almost two years, working with people mostly in the Middle East, the US and Latin America. The Pocha company site is brand new as I try to expand in the world of AI. GO: What’s the difference between automated workflows and agents? EB: A workflow is like a mass production factory. It's a set of operations that work through specific logic to automate a repetitive process that a human has done before. This could be writing and reading emails, writing summaries, reformatting and transferring content through different tools and applications, etc. An AI agent is a thinking environment that makes decisions for you. You can set a workflow for reading your emails. But then you can have an AI agent that summarizes your emails and tells you, if you have 10 emails, what those 10 emails are about in just one email, SMS text, WhatsApp message, Google doc or whatever. GO: So an AI agent has more autonomy and decision-making capabilities than an automated workflow? EB: Definitely. The AI agent is capable of being completely autonomous to make decisions within a given context. You give it a context with defined restrictions that narrows the scope of the decisions it can make. GO: Can you provide any success stories where you worked with a client who had a specific challenge, and you created an automated workflow or agent that successfully delivered a solution? EB: The most recent example is an EdTech company in Boston that provides a training and placement program for clean energy jobs. They've been operating for the past five years, but there’s been a lack of funds, employees and program applicants to scale beyond Massachusetts. So they decided to use AI and automation to build flows without having to invest a lot of money in hiring people. What I did was streamline the application process for people interested in entering the educational program. We created a form and a workflow that takes the information from the application and puts it into an application tracking system. This system has workflows that can trigger emails, daily reports, weekly reports and invitations to interview. Then I created an AI agent. Once the applicants are interviewed by a human, we take the transcript of that, analyze it using AI, and build a report for the decision maker so they can decide if this person is capable of entering the program or not. We also created a scoring system. We built it based on human criteria, which is subjective, and then we converted that into an objective dataset so we could classify people and score them based on numbers. All of this is done by an AI agent that sets a score for the applicant at the end of the interview. Then we have a leaderboard where people are ranked, and the top 15 get into the education program and placement process. GO: Were they happy with the end result? EB: Oh yeah, very happy. Here's where the beauty and magic come in. Now the CEO can envision a way of expanding outside Massachusetts, and tell her team, "Hey, we're going to New York!" Where before, she thought she needed to hire more people in each new state to oversee the operation. And, because an AI agent works 24/7, she doesn't have to wait until 8am to get a report or transcription, or anything anymore. So now, she can think about how to scale her company more successfully without having to hire more people. GO: What's the road map looking ahead? Where are you going with the company in terms of next steps? EB: We're trying to create an outreach system because the purpose of the company is not only to train people but also to place them in clean tech job positions. The outreach system is going to help the team find more companies with open positions, so the company can place more people in those positions. We’re building a system involving AI agents and workflows where we're going to take a picture of all the open positions and analyze and understand them using AI. We want to know, what are the requirements in terms of learning and knowledge capacity for people to get in these positions, so the company can build a better training program. GO: What was the biggest challenge working with them? EB: I think the most important one, and this is something anyone working on this will experience, is the resistance of some team members who don't trust the performance of AI enough. People who have low experience working with AI, and maybe only know ChatGPT, will look at this and say, "I don't believe this can work." So that means there’s a lot of educational work. People need enough knowledge about what AI tools are capable of to suggest what can and can’t work. I think that's the main challenge. But once people see it working, they start to lean into AI. Suddenly, they become like, "This is great. Can you add this other metric? Can you make it do this other thing too? Can you make me one for my personal side hustle?" It's interesting when you see people moving from resistance to acceptance. GO: Working with you has firmly cemented something I've been preoccupied with this year. It's this: One of the most exciting things about AI, which is giving us more time back during the day, requires the most boring thing, which is having uniform file and data structure. As we've discovered together only too well, AI can't reach its full potential unless you have everything structured super cleanly. The analogy I often use is that AI is like an 8-year-old savant. The person is brilliant but he or she often needs really consistent environments and clear guardrails, or things go sideways or just crash. Can you talk about what any organization needs to focus on when it comes to file and data structure? EB: I think one of the most basic things, and I'm living this with a company I'm helping right now, is documenting files and folders exactly the same. You must set protocols for everything when you’re building a folder system to store content and data. That's one of the biggest challenges for companies trying to implement AI automation with poorly standardized systems. When we didn’t have AI a few years ago, we didn't think of a machine reading our documents or files. We never thought that could be possible, so we never really focused on creating really good file structure. The biggest challenge for companies, coming back to Matador, is how to organize the field of play so that AI doesn't struggle. We easily lose the excitement of implementing AI in an organization when an AI is trying to navigate a maze of poorly organized files. For that, you need to build SOPs that tell everyone on the team, “We're going to be naming files this way now so that a 5-year-old can read the titles and understand what's in every one of them. Because if a 5-year-old can read this set of folders and understand what's inside all of them, then AI can do that too. And if AI can find and read everything, then AI can do some truly amazing things and save companies a lot of money. GO: So how are organizations like ours, which have been in operation for a long time, supposed to go back decades and reorganize all our files? EB: We can run a workflow that can do that for you. That's where the ROI comes in. You can make a one-time investment building a workflow that's going to completely standardize all your filing and foldering. But if you do that, you have to know that the ROI might not show up right away. It's going to start paying off later in terms of the time, money, stress and everything it’s going to give back. A CEO must understand that the return on that investment is going to be ongoing through the years, not in the next quarter necessarily. If you have that mentality, then your company is going to become AI-first. GO: You’ve told me before that AI is not a tool, it's a culture. Can you explain that? EB: Right now, the biggest obstacle for AI expanding in many companies are the CEOs. I understand the challenges because they fear a lot of reputational risk. You have a board and customers that are going to be judging you. If you don't have a very good AI road map, then it could turn into a failure, and the fingers are going to be pointing at you. I understand that completely. But AI should be a culture within companies, and that starts top down because the CEO has to embrace trial and error. AI is going to fail at least during the first time you start with any automation. It's like when you're building a prompt. We were talking the other day, and you said using AI is not about writing the perfect first prompt. It's that fifth or sixth prompt that's going to get you to the right answer. You're going to be iterating with automation, too. That's something CEOs have to transmit throughout the organization. GO: I think for many tourism organizations, we haven’t even begun talking about the big picture value of AI. From an internal perspective, for example, agents offer a whole new level for optimizing operations with AI. EB: Yes, exactly. When we're in a company and we're facing challenges, the first intuitive thinking is, "How can I solve this? I'm going to Google it.” Now we're transitioning to, "How can I solve this? I'm going to ask ChatGPT.” This is great, but that's not AI-first. That's changing one tool for another. You're still browsing. It's literally the same thing. You're not really using AI. AI-first means, "I do this thing that's consuming 10 hours a week. I do the same thing every time. I spend two hours every day doing the same four steps. How can I use AI to automate this?" That's AI-first because you're using AI to stop wasting time. I think that's the culture we should be striving for. If a CEO injects the whole company with that mindset, then the employees are going to eventually use AI to solve their issues more independently and autonomously. At the end of the day, what AI really does is gives us more time and more of our lives back, and we have not yet understood that because it's new. But it's true, AI is the way for humans to have more life. GO: I want that. EB: We all do. GO: I have this belief that eventually, in any organization, all meetings will be recorded and deposited into a central knowledge base where an AI can summarize everything and connect all the key takeaways. I might have a meeting and someone on the other side of the world has a meeting, and the AI will know we're talking about the same thing. It will see and surface how there's potential opportunity to connect our efforts. It's like one plus one equals three, or more. Do you think that's where we're going and that it will benefit companies? EB: Definitely. It's the most common sense thing to do, but I know it's also counterintuitive because there are many people who would not like to have all conversations recorded. The fidelity, the accuracy of the information, and it all being in one place and uniformly structured, is everything. You can have thousands of conversations and tell the AI, "Go here and search for this specific idea in all the transcripts where we have talked about that." You just need to build the SOPs. Then a human can quality control it and say, "This is right. This isn't right. Maybe we can tweak this, or build on that." GO: I’ve experienced this firsthand where people are vehemently against this idea of all company meetings being recorded. For many it portends that clichéd dystopic future we see in science fiction, where everything's controlled and you have no freedom, right? EB: I can see it too. We must remember that these tools can be turned off. If we let the technology control us, then that's on us. I think at the end of the day, it's about how do you balance the risk and rewards? This is something CEOs are used to. Do you prefer to live in blindness and have an uncompetitive company because you decided not to take that risk with automation? Or do you take the risk and have everything recorded, even though some people are going to say it’s Orwellian in a way, and even though ultimately it's going to improve everybody's life? We have to find that balance, and that’s the CEO’s role to determine what’s best overall for the company, customers and employees in the future. GO: Any last thoughts? EB: I think we are not quite there yet to know for sure the amount of ROI that is going to come from agents and automations. Definitely it is going to be positive ROI. For that, I'm completely sure. What I'm not sure is how do we measure ROI based on the anticipated lifetime value of the process? So much is changing so quickly and it's difficult to see the future. As the tools get better, then the workflow gets better too, so the ROI increases, right? Except, we don't really have models for that. For CEOs, I think, they have to try to envision how they can measure the value of automations now, and how that might evolve exponentially in the future. Greg Oates

What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates CEOs at destination marketing and management organizations (DMOs) are seeking AI guidance specifically tailored to their chief executive roles. A CEO in the U.S. told me recently that current AI education is often too surface level, vague, unstructured, or trying to cover too much ground to be useful for a chief executive. He said, "We've been talking for a while now about how we need AI education targeting leadership, but it doesn't really exist." While destination leaders face many more questions about AI than answers, one thing is 100% clear: CEOs must own and lead their organizations' AI integration across all departments. AI isn't something to outsource or delegate to others, and it's not a "marketing thing" for the CMO to figure out. Conor Grennan , chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, consults with clients on AI strategy from JPMorgan to NASA. I asked him how important it is for CEOs to lead AI education, adoption and integration across their organizations. “CEOs have to understand how to use AI and why; they really have to have felt the delight about what AI can do,” he said. "They also have to see clearly how AI is a leadership and change management challenge, not a tech challenge. Then they need to start out being vulnerable, and be able to say, ‘Hey, I was skeptical about AI. I didn’t understand it, either. But now I can explain the way I learned it and how to communicate why it’s important to help other people understand it.” So why do CEOs need to understand AI? Jeff Bezos answered that at The New York Times DealBook Summit last year. He described how “modern AI is a horizontal enabling layer" that will soon be integrated into every device and digital application in existence. "These kind of horizontal layers like electricity and compute and now artificial intelligence, they go everywhere," he said. "I guarantee you there is not a single application that you can think of that is not going to be made better by AI." Here's the clip: Strategic AI Approaches I met with about a dozen CEOs in North America to find out what they want to know about AI specifically from a CEO perspective. Some leaders are seeking big-picture guidance with a broad overview of high-level strategy. "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” one CEO told me. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" Another chief executive said, “We see three areas of opportunity for AI: Administrative tasks and general productivity; marketing chat, SEO and data readiness; and helping customers find information about our city more effectively.… The two most important things I want to know are how to develop AI policy and how is AI changing SEO." A year ago, most CEOs had a wait-and-see attitude about AI, following how the technology evolved and what their cohorts in other organizations were doing. Today, there is a general consensus among CEOs that they need to invest in AI, but the question is how and where. One CEO told me he knows he needs to integrate AI tools and processes into his DMO, but he has three overarching questions that he wants answered first, at least at a high level: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” Other CEOs are seeking clarity on the basic fundamentals of AI: "I need to understand what are the problems that we're trying to solve with AI. What is the purpose of a chatbot, for example? What am I buying, and what can we as an organization accomplish with it?" And then others just want immediate actionable solutions: "I'm not interested in hypotheticals. Show me five ways I can implement AI on Monday. Give me turnkey AI solutions that work today." AI Data is King Personalized data is one of generative AI’s biggest value propositions. Conversational AI (chat) is the new marketplace, and it’s eating the entire funnel including in-destination engagement. In some cities, AI chat conversations between DMOs and visitors is exceeding 25% in-destination, giving DMOs a way to influence visitor behavior in real time. Also, in some industry segments like tours and activities, in-chat conversations are driving in-destination bookings with partners like GetYourGuide. Everyone is looking for first/zero-party data around that. “We have a low level of proprietary data about who is in our destination and what they’re doing,” asserted one CEO. “We have a few disparate data sources, but we need to connect those, and we want to be able to use it predictively. For example, we're looking at regression analysis to help develop future scenario modeling, and we're looking at AI to help us with that." Another CEO said, “We need data that provides material value for our partners. That’s our mandate. How are our visitors spending money and where? How are they behaving and traveling through our area? How can we help people find our partners in a more personalized way?” And one CEO added, "A key priority for us is figuring out the data equation so outbound messaging can be tailored to a 1-on-1 relationship.” Striving for that direct individual customer engagement has been the holy grail for marketers for decades. The ability to deliver mass personalization at scale is now coming into focus with enhanced AI data curation. National organizations like Destination Canada and Germany Travel have invested millions of dollars in data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to restructure their tourism product data from scratch, capitalize on the data more effectively to rank higher in AI search, and drive incremental revenue to partners. That's what the future looks like. For more information, check out the new Canadian Tourism Data Collective and Germany's Open Data Project . Today, local tourism organizations are starting to see how data structure and content architecture are strategic imperatives for them, too. One municipal CEO explained, "I think it might almost be too early to have this conversation in some areas until AI matures more. One thing I am eager to know now is how do we develop a data lake to structure our own data and messaging to make it easier for AI search tools to find." AI search and SEO are a huge conversation today. During the past year, the #1 question I heard while speaking about AI with dozens of North American destination organizations, their boards and key industry/community stakeholders, was: How do we rank higher in AI search? What happens when AI buries organic content? What’s going to happen to our websites? Are they going to disappear? Is a DMO without a website still a DMO? How do we need to produce content differently? And, what the heck is a data lake? One CEO I spoke with is planning on developing a new website for her organization. She said, "I don't even know what I don't know about AI search, but we need to figure some of that out before we start spending any money." Along with data, defining KPIs for AI integration is a hot topic of debate, and presently there isn’t a complete and codified list of metrics that DMO leaders agree on. That said, perhaps the travel and tourism industry collectively needs to understand what AI is, and what it can accomplish at scale, before attaching too many metrics to it. A CMO told me at DI MarCom Summit this month, “People didn’t ask about ROI with the internet when it first came around. We just knew we had to have it,” because it was a new channel for reaching visitors. Same as AI now. Expanding on that, he suggested that DMOs need to break AI success tracking into awareness metrics and performance metrics, and get that conversation right before anything else. Staff AI Adoption Unlike previous technology evolutions, there doesn’t seem to be as much of a generational divide between early adopters of AI and everyone else. The industry can’t look to Gen Z for guidance about how to use AI to the same degree we once asked Millennials for insights about Instagram. Again, driving AI adoption across an organization begins with the CEO. Once that’s established, the real challenge is convincing department leaders and staff to lean into AI. It's a challenge because there is widespread concern, skepticism and/or suspicion among many staff members across many industries that they’re being asked to learn new technologies that will eventually replace them. Leadership should say to employees that no one can force them to use AI, but the job market will. The data is clear. According to the Linkedin/Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index : 79% of leaders agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with Al skills than a more experienced one without 66% of leaders won’t hire someone without AI skills 60% of leaders worry their organization lacks a plan and vision to implement AI And that's a year old. But, understandably, emphasizing those numbers comes across as threatening. A better strategy for driving AI adoption is finding staff members who are already seeing success with AI, supporting them with access to education and pro AI models, and working out from there. The more employees see their colleagues using AI, the more some of them feel inclined to lean in. Therefore, every DMO needs a comprehensive strategic AI road map that includes purpose, policy, education, integration and a continuous feedback loop across all levels of staff. CEOs need to create a space for that. "We're giving our staff time to play around with AI, but they have to present what they're focusing on and what they're learning to their individual supervisor," a CEO told me. Another added, “We're focusing on staff adoption. But I need you to explain to me what works, how to implement, and what should I watch out for." I'm presently working with our departments at Matador Network to explore a bunch of various AI models to optimize workflows, boost creativity, enhance strategic planning, diversify product, etc. There's a well-communicated mandate from the top that Matador will become an AI-first company, and sooner than later. To help accelerate that, we created an AI task force to bring more perspectives from across the company together to integrate AI into operations. That has been valuable with some immediate takeaways, such as staff is now reaching out and asking for assistance with AI. But it's only a start. "There's this idea that if you can get a core group of people using AI then their attitudes and behaviors will spread organically throughout the rest of the company," said Conor Grennan at NYU. "It doesn't work that way. You have to find the people who have fears about AI and listen to them to understand why. You have to say, 'Yes, AI does suck at that, but here's what it's good at.' You also need to weed out the negative people who are against AI outright. They're dangerous." 5 Key Takeaways Let's go back to that first CEO who wants to know the five big questions about AI. Based on the input from the above CEOs, here's a first stab at that: How can I create AI policy that serves our organization but doesn't suppress experimentation among staff? (Interestingly, policy did not come up that much with the CEOs I spoke with.) How do we need to develop our websites, content and data to rank higher in AI search? How is AI SEO different, and the same, as old SEO? What are existing AI chat platforms accomplishing, how are visitors using them, and how are they influencing travel decision making and purchase behavior? If AI is not just for marketing, what does the ecosystem of AI tools for all departments look like across the organization? And what do they do in terms of increasing productivity, creativity and quality? How do I get staff to buy in? We know AI is an imperative for our organization's competitive advantage and relevance. And we know AI is an imperative for employees for their professional growth and marketability. But how do we get our people to really believe in the need to embrace AI? Greg Oates

Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Royce Chwin, president and CEO of Destination Vancouver , personifies how a DMO chief executive needs to establish and articulate the mandate for integrating AI across the organization. That was the topic of our last Destination AI post where 12 CEOs explained: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . Early in 2024, Chwin addressed the full staff in Destination Vancouver’s office before a session I was presenting there on AI. “We cannot not do this,” he said, stating that the organization needed to adopt AI processes to stay relevant in the industry and increase its value in the community. If Destination Vancouver is positioning itself as an innovative DMO, he explained, then the road ahead with AI was clear. Since then, Destination Vancouver launched a new website fully integrated with AI where visitors can customize how they find travel information. The build was a two-year process requiring an inordinate amount of learning to capitalize on generative AI. The team also developed an AI policy guide that Chwin shared for this post. The comprehensive document is designed to "provide clear protocols that maximize and encourage the use of Al tools where appropriate and safe to do so, while minimizing any potential risks and concerns." The policy guide encourages staff to use AI for "enhancing productivity, efficiency, creativity or decision-making." It defines when not to use AI models and how staff is required to review and validate all AI outputs for accuracy and bias. Also, Stefan Hawes, vp of global marketing, initiated the development of an internal AI Council, bringing together a diverse group of staff to coordinate AI processes across the organization. Chwin shared an internal briefing report outlining the purpose of the Council as follows: It is recommended that an AI Council be established immediately to provide a centralized body for managing AI-related initiatives and to expand training opportunities for team members. The Council will focus on: Setting strategic priorities related to AI Selecting use cases, implementing projects/initiatives/AI software purchases and evaluating their effectiveness Developing a data strategy to support AI adoption and initiatives Developing an AI education, literacy and adoption program Ensuring ethical compliance Fostering cross-departmental collaboration to maximize the impact of AI projects We created a similar AI task force at Matador, and the value of that cannot be overstated to better assess how staff from different departments perceive, and misperceive, AI in general. I talked with Chwin this week to better understand how a DMO CEO can best lead strategic AI implementation across his or her organization. The purpose of this post is to help inform, inspire and influence other CEOs to consider the opportunities of AI in a new light. Greg Oates: Royce, you've been a strident proponent of AI for a couple years now, and yet there are many other CEOs who are still reticent. How did you personally come to decide Destination Vancouver needed to embrace AI? Royce Chwin: The perception still of some DMOs is that we are behind when it comes to technology. We're slow to adapt. We're slow to evolve. You see all these other organizations in the travel sphere around us that are able to move much quicker. They might be capitalized better. They can adjust. They can pivot quicker to take on these new technologies, and they can experiment seemingly without the degree of fear or consternation that maybe some DMOs have. So, I think there's lots of different reasons. For us, I mean, it's day and night. We can't not do that. Our entire ecosystem that we play in has some level of AI being used. Number one is our customers. They’re using AI. So it goes back to that same idea that you and I have discussed many times before: How do we as a DMO stay relevant and how do we show value? AI is a response to answering those two things. GO: In many organizations today, there’s often skepticism and suspicion among staff about how AI might take their jobs, or they’re dismissive of AI altogether. How does your team feel about AI overall? RC: I'm not finding a fear in our organization for using AI. I think it's a different set of challenges. I think there are so many derivatives of AI out there that people don't know what to focus on. Because you can’t and don't need to focus on 40 different AI tools. The question is, what are the best tools that are most relevant to the work that I need to do? That, I think, in my experience is a bigger challenge. My sense of it is that AI can be so overwhelming. It can seem unbelievably complicated. So we had to ask ourselves, do we have the time, resources and skill sets to simply understand it? Secondly, are we asking better questions to understand what in the organization we need to solve, and can AI help? GO: In a previous post, I shared input from 12 DMO CEOs about how they feel about AI. What are you hearing from other CEOs? RC: I was over in Europe recently for Destinations International’s Global Leaders Forum where I was onstage with Sherrif Karamat (CEO of PCMA) and Petra Stušek (CEO at Ljubljana Tourism). We were talking about the importance of face-to-face meetings and so on, and Sherrif made a comment that DMOs are really behind using AI. It was kind of a blanket statement, and he's not wrong. But, I said to Sheriff that I think a lot of DMOs are behind because it's like throwing confetti in somebody's face and asking them to pick the best pieces. They don't even know what they're trying to evaluate, and it’s also moving so fast. In the meantime, our customers are running around us using AI for all kinds of things. And so I think that there's not so much a fear of using AI. It’s more that people are questioning how to respond to the increasing emergence of AI because they’re thinking, “I'm not really 100% clear on the business problem I'm trying to solve that supports my mandate.” For us, and you saw it when you visited, we were really clear on what it is that we needed to do. We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI. “We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI.” GO: I’ve been asserting that CEOs should own and lead AI adoption in their organizations to have the best chance for success. I don't mean lead it day to day. I mean the chief executive must establish the mandate that AI is something the organization is going to invest in, and articulate why and how to the entire staff. Connor Grennan, chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, emphasized to me that’s the only way this works. Do you agree? RC: Yes, I absolutely believe it must come from the CEO because the CEO has to clear the vision with the team. And with something as seismic as AI, and how it’s evolving in our daily life, in our world, I think the CEO has a responsibility to address it and how it will impact the organization. Everyone needs to understand how we’re going to use AI in alignment with our mission and strategic goals, and how it will support the mandate. That's all CEO level. That's the responsibility on my head. Also, I can't imagine going in front of my Board and asking, “Hey, what are you doing with AI? What should we do with AI?” So it has to come from the CEO, but my Board has also enabled me. Like, there's no grief from my Board. Zero. We are fully enabled. GO: You've created the necessary structure to help govern AI integration with your AI Policy and AI Council. Can you expand on the thinking behind those? RC: We developed an AI policy that’s designed to enable people to use AI and not discourage them from experimenting. Obviously, some education is required in terms of proprietary information and those kinds of things. But we're really leaning into this and we're going to assign some time for it to enable the organization to experiment and play with AI without fear of reprisal. Naturally there needs to be governance around it, but governance does not mean stopping creativity. Governance means we’re creating and delivering new opportunities for creativity. There just needs to be structure around that. Also, Stefan came up with the idea of pulling together an AI Council in the organization, which I think is fantastic. We're getting individuals from each business line, including myself, and we’re going to talk about AI, its impacts, what we need to be thinking about, and how we'll improve our website and the organization as a whole. So we're creating dialogue around it to define opportunities. For example, I'm really excited about AI as it relates to all the country market analysis that we do. We've been doing that by spreadsheet, but now we’re exploring AI to provide the insights we need to inform our market planning more effectively. There are lots of different examples like that, but you only discover them by being open to experimenting with AI. Greg Oates

Toronto & Denver Tourism Leaders on the 5 Big AI Questions for CEOs Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates A year from now, the travel and tourism sector might look back and thank Andrew Weir, president and CEO of Destination Toronto , for catalyzing how DMOs move forward with AI. At PCMA Convening Leaders in January this year, I asked Weir what CEOs need to understand about AI at a high level. Numerous other CEOs have told me there’s a complete lack of AI education specifically designed for DMO chief executives. His answer was first shared anonymously in our previous post, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” said Weir. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" At the end of that post I suggested what those five questions might be based on all the CEO insights in there, and I've since been shopping them around to vet them. A few weeks ago, for example, Richard Scharf, president and CEO at Visit Denver , suggested restructuring the questions to create a more logical hierarchy. Now, the first three deal with internal operations while the last two identify external, visitor-facing priorities. Yesterday, I spoke again with Weir, as well as Paula Port, vice president of marketing at Destination Toronto, for their input on the five questions. The goal here is to provide clear structure around AI platforms and processes for DMOs leading up to Matador Network’s collaboration with U.S. Travel at ESTO in Phoenix this fall. Together, we’ll be co-hosting an interactive, multi-station “AI Playground” educational activation during the three days of the conference. Here are the five big AI questions. These will evolve but now we have a foundation to begin building consensus on how DMOs can capitalize on opportunities and navigate challenges with AI today. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The 5 Big AI Questions 1. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? A growing number of DMO leaders say their teams embrace AI for the most part, and many are actively developing basic AI strategy. That’s a significant shift from a year ago. At the same time, there's still varying degrees of cynicism and skepticism about AI in other organizations. I asked Weir about his staff. “I don't feel like we're dragging the team into this,” he said. “It's really more a matter of how people are at such different places with AI. So our goal is figuring out how to channel all their knowledge and energy, and kind of align and unify that, without stifling anyone’s creativity.” Scharf at Visit Denver emphasized that this question should be the first one, because successful AI integration begins with understanding your staff’s grasp of AI and their appetite for leaning into it. “ChatGPT is growing like Zoom did a few years ago so we know we need to use it,” he said. “The first thing we did was survey staff to assess how they feel about AI, and how or if they’re using it. Then we started off with small bites like email. Now we think of AI as a toolkit, and we're continuing to explore what tools are appropriate for different needs.” Port added that AI integration across teams works best with both structured and self-directed learning. “We started by making everything (ChatGPT Plus, Google Gemini) available to everyone, so they were given access to tools and resources, but a lot of this is really self-directed learning,” she said. “What we're seeing now is people have taken advantage of that and moved forward with it. Some maybe a little bit further than others, so maybe we need to address that. I think we still need more use cases and more structured learning because we're not all at the same level in terms of knowing and understanding how to put AI to use.” 2. How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? Destination Toronto was one of the first North American municipal DMOs to develop an AI policy. They began the process by pulling examples from larger government-operated tourism organizations including Destination Canada and Destination British Columbia. “We set up that policy structure first in terms of what we wanted as an organization, and also being very clear that any use of AI was meant to drive business results,” said Weir. “I think we were able to get there pretty quickly because we didn't create a series of regulations. We built a series of philosophies and principles to guide where we go. It was meant to put guardrails around protecting information, while at the same time, stimulate learning and sharing. Because we said to the team that you are free and encouraged to use AI, but there is an expectation that you will share what you've learned.” Port explained further that, “We leveraged existing processes already in place from a content perspective in terms of bias, IT usage, etc. We have an assessment process for any sort of software application that we're looking to use, so we did the same with AI.” (Note: The next GuideGeek Destination AI post will be with Kara Franker, president and CEO of Visit Florida Keys, who is also an attorney. We discussed AI policy at length.) 3. How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? Scharf stated that integrating AI platforms and processes beyond marketing is “where all the work is happening now.” His organization is switching out regular stand up meetings with extended AI workshops and visiting speakers to learn more about AI tools for various use cases across departments. Leadership, he said, including himself, are present at these meetings so everyone is learning together. Weir and Port both addressed this question, saying they need to first explore how Simpleview, Cvent and other tech partners are integrating AI functionality before looking at any new AI platforms. We discussed PCMA’s Project Spark , an AI-native event development tool that includes the new Destinaitor destination sourcing platform. DMO leadership and sales teams are exploring Spark to understand how clients are using new AI software to evaluate, compare and source destinations for business events. Others, like Kara Franker mentioned above, are looking for new AI solutions to optimize their HR and accounting departments, but she said many of the available options presently are only enterprise grade. Something DMOs should really look at, and I’m not sure how/if many already are, but there is proven value in creating custom GPTs for sales teams. GPTs are like mini ChatGPTs designed for specific purposes that anyone with a ChatGPT Plus account can create. For example, a sales rep can build a knowledge base inside a GPT by uploading sales materials, examples of successful bids, product information, pricing, team members, case studies, testimonials and other data. The next step is to develop internal GPT instructions to direct what the GPT does and what it prioritizes. Following that, the rep can then chat with the GPT and ask it to create a customized bid for a potential client that pulls all relevant source materials from the knowledge base that best supports the pitch. I’m imagining the ability to create custom GPTs is going to soon be a standard and required capability for all sales teams. One of the earliest enterprise examples of this was Salesforce’s Einstein GPT, which has since morphed into Agentforce. We use them at Matador because of improved efficiency and quality. GPTs also provide a new option for creative brainstorming, which some salespeople appreciate who don't identify as being super creative. Increases in sales production can be clearly identified. However, there's increasing conversation about tracking success in other departments. When AI delivers clear improvements in efficiency and saves people significant time, how do you measure that? One concern is that people will then just work a six hour day versus eight hours. The common thinking is that organizations will need to adjust productivity benchmarks, but this is a messy conversation. I don’t know enough to comment on that yet, but I wanted to put a pin in it because it’s something we’ll all need to look at eventually as AI scales in the workforce. 4. How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? I was addressing Visit Denver’s Board a while back and one member suggested that DMOs won’t need websites soon because they’ll be replaced by a ChatGPT-like window. I’m surprised by how much this comes up. For one thing, DMOs will always need some kind of online knowledge base for AI search queries. If anything, that will require more content and more comprehensive product information because AI search thrives more than anything on data structure, clarity and specificity. That said, the web user interface will likely evolve considerably. Expect to hear a lot more about how DMOs are developing data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to optimize data structure for AI search. For further context, here's a Perplexity Pro response to the question: "Are tourism boards developing data lakes and warehouses to optimize their sites for AI search?" Weir suggested that this conversation about the future of websites is not unlike what we went through 15 years ago, when people were lamenting the death of DMO sites because social media was deemed by some as the new web. More important, he asserted, is seeing how AI search is evolving and being prepared to adapt strategy. “I think there is a push-pull here between how we lead and where customers are at,” said Weir. “We want to deliver more information through our AI assistant and AI search in general, but customers aren't really there yet. I don't know what the percentage is, but the majority of people are still using Google. They're still beginning an interaction on the web by entering search terms in Google the traditional way. At some point, that's going to flip, right? It's going to be a few percent more each month or quarter, whatever that is. But how far ahead of it do we get? And how do we calibrate? We can try to lead on this, but you know, we also have to stay in step with where our customers are too.” 5. How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? Chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI have dashboards that clearly identify what visitors are asking about in the destination. That helps inform content and product development strategy, and the data is valuable for community engagement. AI chat platforms also operate 24/7 in 50+ languages, which helps DMO influence in-destination travel and spending for a much wider audience than ever before. How to best capitalize on conversational AI, and ultimately conversational commerce, is an evolving topic because we’re still in the early days where travelers are learning they can search with large language models and trust them. ChatGPT has 400 million weekly users but ChatGPT only added full functioning search capability for all users a few months ago. Consumers are just beginning to understand that they can now “talk” to a city. To help accelerate understanding and adoption of AI chat among visitors, Port asserted that the onus is on DMOs to promote their AI chat robustly like any other channel. Weir did that recently by highlighting Destination Toronto’s GuideGeek-powered “6ix” chat platform on LinkedIn, asking, “Ever had a chat directly with a city?” Weir was specifically promoting the organization’s WhatsApp platform, where people can now have a highly personalized, iterative conversation directly with Destination Toronto via the GuideGeek AI integration. The same functionality exists with the other Meta platforms, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. A few hours after Weir's post I received a Slack message from our CTO Stefan Klopp wondering what was going on in Toronto. WhatsApp volume was spiking, he said, and he was asking if Toronto had sent out a press release promoting 6ix, or something. No, it was just a quick CEO social media post. Also, Tourism New Zealand just launched a new campaign in collaboration with “A Minecraft Movie” that integrates GuideGeek-powered prompt questions to trigger further engagement. So, those are just a couple examples of how DMO/NTOs can drive AI chat engagement. The question for Weir and Port though is about the types of questions people are asking in AI chat platforms. Presently, a lot of the chat conversations are more utilitarian, related to queries about hotels, restaurants, attractions, events, directions, etc. So as conversational AI adoption increases, will DMOs focus more on developing content that answers those basic types of questions, like what hotel, restaurant or attraction is highly rated, and how to get there. Or, should DMOs continue to focus mainly on developing what is generally perceived as more inspirational destination and experiential content? "The question then becomes about responding to inquiries versus the inspirational side," explained Port. "Like, all of these articles, all of this content that we serve up, that is not in response to a question per se. It's more packaged to inspire people. I think a lot of that's going to have to exist outside our environments, maybe, whether it's influencers, it's your earned media strategy, it's content partnerships, things like that. That's where I think the inspiration will exist. But we really have to move to being more of the informative one, on our website or whatever a website is. But it needs to be very specific in answering questions. We already see that on GuideGeek." Weir summed up, saying, "I think this ends up relating more to, again, that question of where the customers are. Are we putting ourselves in a position to answer their questions and deliver the information in the way they're looking for it, using AI and the data lake approach? Or, are we curators like we've always been, inspiring visitors with local experiences, or is the customer now the curator by virtue of how they're asking questions today?" Summary These five takeaways are aligned with the five big AI questions. AI adoption begins with talking to DMO staff to understand what the organization is working with. Love the idea about marrying structured and self-directed learning, and being intentional about that with staff. At some point, for AI adoption to scale and continually evolve on an ongoing basis, there needs to be AI leaders in any organization who pick up the torch and inspire their colleagues to lean into AI. Otherwise, things tend to plateau with the same people using the same AI models. AI policy is intended to encourage staff to innovate with AI as much as it's meant to protect organizations. AI is the death of "I don't know," so it can benefit all staff in all departments. That in itself is enough ROI to validate initial investments in AI. The tools can provide a foundation of knowledge and direction for problem solving and strategic planning exponentially better than traditional search. Some organizations, like Visit Greece who we work with, have phenomenal website data structure ideally optimized for AI search. Meanwhile, one CEO told me "Our website is a mess with outdated content and poor data structure. We need to rebuild from scratch with AI search top of mind." Chat is the new marketplace, and AI is eating the entire funnel including in-destination. Moreover, AI chat data provides DMO leaders with insights into what visitors are asking about. Although, I think as chat adoption scales mainstream, the conversations will evolve beyond asking for a good hotel or restaurant. Greg Oates

Why Small Steps With AI Create Big Wins for Tourism Organizations Sep 22 Written By Greg Oates Key Theme: How to Align Strategic Risk Management and Progressive AI Implementation The rush to transform everything with AI has dominated boardroom discussions since ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Yet the most successful organizations aren't pursuing wholesale AI overhauls. They're taking calculated, incremental steps that deliver real value while building capabilities for the future. MIT researchers interviewed senior managers at 21 large companies actively using generative AI. Their findings challenge the prevailing narrative about AI transformation. Companies are deliberately choosing "small t" transformations over risky, large-scale implementations. This approach works particularly well for tourism organizations where customer trust and regulatory compliance matter deeply. Tourism organizations face unique challenges with AI adoption. Customer data privacy concerns run high. Regulatory requirements vary across jurisdictions. Service quality directly impacts reputation. The research reveals that successful companies treat AI implementation like climbing a risk slope. They start with low-risk internal applications before moving to customer-facing solutions. This measured approach isn't about being timid. It's about being smart. Tourism CEOs can build organizational confidence, develop necessary skills, and demonstrate tangible value before tackling more complex implementations. Start With Universal Productivity Tools That Employees Already Want to Use The research uncovered a surprising reality. Employees were already using ChatGPT and other public AI tools without permission. Companies responded by providing secure, private versions of these tools. This grassroots adoption pattern offers tourism organizations a clear starting point. Consider how your marketing team writes destination descriptions. Your operations staff creates training materials. Your finance team prepares reports. These tasks consume hours of employee time across every department. Private AI instances from providers like ChatGPT or Claude eliminate security concerns while boosting productivity. McKinsey built a custom platform called Lilli that connects AI to 40 internal knowledge sources. The result? Seventy-five percent employee adoption in under a year. Time savings up to 30%. Substantially improved work quality. Tourism organizations don't need to build something this sophisticated initially. Even basic AI writing assistants can transform daily work. Microsoft Copilot integration takes this further. Employees can search across company documents instantly. They can pull content from emails, meeting transcripts, and presentations. One manager described it as having "a super search engine" for company information. Imagine your team finding that obscure policy document from three years ago in seconds rather than hours. The beauty of starting here? Minimal risk. Maximum adoption. Employees want these tools. They're probably already using consumer versions. Providing enterprise versions addresses security concerns while meeting existing demand. Your IT team maintains control. Your employees get productivity gains. Everyone wins. Some employees will still seek external tools for specific needs. One product manager uses Midjourney for quick visuals. Another uses voice-to-text tools for performance reviews. Accept this reality. Focus on providing core tools internally while establishing clear guidelines for external tool usage. Deploy AI for Specific Roles While Keeping Humans in Control Once basic AI tools gain traction, tourism organizations can target specific job functions. The key insight from the research? Maintain human oversight for quality control. This "human in the loop" approach reduces risk while capturing efficiency gains. Customer service represents an ideal starting point for tourism organizations. AI can help agents find information quickly. It can suggest responses in real time. It can analyze call patterns to identify coaching opportunities. MIT researchers found AI coaching tools increased call center productivity by 14% on average. New and low-skilled workers improved by 34%. Morgan Stanley equipped financial advisors with an AI assistant trained on over one million internal documents. The tool doesn't replace advisors. It helps them find information faster so they can focus on customer relationships. Tourism organizations can apply this same principle. Help your concierge staff access local recommendations instantly. Enable tour guides to answer obscure historical questions accurately. Support reservation agents with instant access to availability across properties. CarMax demonstrates another powerful application. The company uses AI to generate descriptions for over 5,000 car pages. Manual creation would take multiple humans 11 years. With AI, it takes hours. The 80% approval rate from editorial review proves quality doesn't suffer. Tourism organizations can apply this to property descriptions, tour summaries, and destination guides. Creative teams at Dentsu use AI throughout their workflow. From proposals to budgeting to ideation. The emerging technology director noted employees spend less time on mundane tasks. They create higher-quality content with less effort. Tourism marketing teams can similarly accelerate campaign development, social media content creation, and promotional material design. Finance departments traditionally resist new technology. Yet some organizations successfully use AI for audit reports, regulatory compliance, and fraud detection. Amazon's finance team reports employees shifted from repetitive tasks to critical thinking work. Tourism organizations can start with expense report processing or invoice matching before tackling complex financial analysis. Transform Customer Experiences Gradually With Clear Boundaries Customer-facing AI sits highest on the risk slope. Yet the potential rewards justify careful exploration. The research shows companies succeeding by setting clear boundaries and expanding gradually. Chatbots evolved from frustrating phone trees to sophisticated conversational agents. John Hancock's insurance chatbots handle common queries effectively. Human agents focus on complex issues. Starbucks, Domino's, and CVS expanded to voice interactions. Video interactions come next. Tourism organizations can start with FAQ chatbots on their websites. Add booking assistance once that works well. Expand to voice-based concierge services when ready. Personalization transforms online shopping experiences. Tapestry, parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, uses real-time language modifications. The conversational tone mimics in-store associates. Revenue increased at least 3%. Tourism organizations can personalize trip recommendations based on past bookings. Adjust website content for different traveler segments. Customize email campaigns for individual preferences. Software companies already embed AI throughout their products. Adobe users create and modify images effortlessly. Canva simplifies presentation creation. Lucidchart converts text descriptions into flowcharts. Tourism organizations benefit as their existing software vendors add AI features. Property management systems will suggest optimal pricing. Booking platforms will predict cancellation risks. Marketing tools will automate campaign optimization. The key? Start small. Test thoroughly. Expand gradually. A failed internal productivity tool frustrates employees. A failed customer-facing AI damages your brand. Move up the risk slope deliberately. Build Foundational Capabilities Before Attempting Major Transformations The research revealed an uncomfortable truth. Scaling AI from pilot to production is harder than expected. Data quality issues multiply. Edge cases appear more frequently. Integration challenges compound. Many organizations discovered they needed stronger foundations before pursuing ambitious AI projects. CarMax's chief information officer emphasized data quality. "Good data will give you good results from AI." Poor data produces unreliable outputs. Tourism organizations must audit their data systems. Customer records across multiple systems need reconciliation. Historical booking data requires cleaning. Property information needs standardization. Governance structures matter equally. Who approves AI projects? How do you measure success? What happens when AI makes mistakes? Establish these frameworks before scaling implementations. Small pilots can proceed without perfect governance. Enterprise deployments cannot. Capital One's chief scientist warned against the "gold-rush mentality." Thoughtful, responsible implementation beats rushed deployment. Build the scaffolding to bring everyone along. Tourism organizations should resist pressure to match competitors' AI announcements. Focus on sustainable progress over headlines. Management buy-in proves essential for larger projects. One technology company's AI efforts stagnated until the CEO personally championed them. Small wins build credibility for bigger investments. Document productivity gains from initial deployments. Share customer satisfaction improvements. Make the business case concrete before requesting major funding. Summary: Small Transformations Today Enable Big Transformations Tomorrow The research delivers a clear message for tourism CEOs. Successful AI implementation doesn't require revolutionary change. It requires evolutionary progress. Start with universal productivity tools that employees already want. Target specific roles with human oversight. Transform customer experiences within careful boundaries. Build foundational capabilities systematically. This approach particularly suits tourism organizations. Your business depends on human connections. Technology should enhance these connections, not replace them. Your customers value authentic experiences. AI should enable better experiences, not artificial ones. Your reputation takes years to build and moments to destroy. Measured AI deployment protects what you've built while enabling future growth. The companies studied aren't waiting for perfect AI solutions. They're using today's technology to solve real problems while preparing for tomorrow's possibilities. They're training employees, cleaning data, and establishing governance. When breakthrough AI capabilities arrive, they'll be ready to capitalize quickly. Tourism organizations can follow this same path. Deploy AI writing assistants next month. Add customer service chatbots next quarter. Enhance personalization next year. Each step builds on the last. Each success enables the next. Small transformations compound into competitive advantage. The AI transformation race isn't won by the fastest starter. It's won by consistent, strategic progress. Tourism CEOs who embrace "small t" transformation today position their organizations for "big T" transformation tomorrow. The journey starts with a single step up the risk slope. Greg Oates

How to Develop AI Strategy for Your Organization Oct 12 Written By Greg Oates The 2050 City AI Roadmap provides a high-level strategic framework for how DMOs and other organizations can capitalize on AI to optimize internal operations, resources and knowledge, and ultimately, drive partner revenue. DMOs have all kinds of strategic plans, master plans, business and marketing plans, etc. The 2050 City AI Roadmap outlines the process to develop your AI strategic plan. It defines the big picture outlook for AI as the future of commerce, and it proposes a methodology to help DMO leaders prioritize, organize and navigate how they go about integrating AI across their organization. Presently, we're rolling this out with Visit Mesa , Tourism Richmond in British Columbia, and The Florida Keys & Key West . The three CEOs for those organizations have all agreed to share takeaways and business outcomes with each others' teams to cross-pollinate learning and accelerate AI process integration. That spirit of knowledge sharing and co-learning for me is huge, because we as an industry are all pretty much flying blindly with AI from a macro perspective. Yes, we've come a long way in the last year. Every DMO CEO I talk to these days is now implementing various AI processes and seeing value. However, we're all kind of flying this plane while we're building it at the same time, and we don't really have a destination, or even due north, in mind. The 2050 City AI Roadmap was designed to identify where we're going with this emergent technology that's both incredibly powerful and often highly unpredictable. It also defines how high-end AI chat platforms, like Matador Network's GuideGeek AI , are the tip of the spear for agentic commerce. The following guidelines are based on experience in the workplace to deliver new value with AI for your team, board, industry partners and community stakeholders. Internal & External Direction Every decision related to AI strategy should first be defined through an internal or external lens. Your board members will typically view internal workplace optimization as tactical. Externally, AI integrations that are consumer-facing and revenue generating are usually perceived as more strategic. Internal Facing From an internal standpoint, the focus of the AI Roadmap is on optimizing operations to take advantage of an organization's aggregate of resources and knowledge. Imagine the totality of insights across every team member in terms of their expertise and networks in their communities. AI systems are designed to pool and capitalize on that, but only if an organization's knowledge base is structured intelligently. That means rebuilding your folder structures and files naming conventions so an AI can find everything. According to Slack, workers spend 41% of their time on menial tasks, including endless hours just looking for information. The overall losses related to productivity, quality of work and workplace, and physical/mental health are crazy. So let's start there with AI strategy to address our internal digital dumpster fire. External Facing Externally, from a marketing, sales and visitor/partner engagement perspective, AI strategy begins with integrating a robust AI chat platform like GuideGeek. DMOs have never really had proprietary information on who their visitors are. They have geo-location, credit card spend, event attendance data, etc., which show visitor behavior. But none of those really identify visitor motivations and mindsets indepth. With an AI chat platform, DMOs can now pull analytics showing what visitors are actually asking and what they want to know on an individual and aggregate basis. We launched our new GuideGeek V2 analytics dashboard this past week, which provides deeper, fuller insights into visitor psychographics. That data then informs all kinds of resource allocation decisions related to content development, AI SEO strategy, data analysis, product and destination development, community engagement, etc. CEO Roles AI is best defined as a new digital "co-intelligence" that can communicate, reason and create for the first time ever, versus just another new technology. We emphasize that AI is really a new environment for collaboration more than anything, just not solely among humans anymore. Learning AI is not like learning Photoshop. You can only "teach" AI up to a point, like trying to teach someone how to ride a bike. You can't teach a child how to stay on two wheels without falling in a classroom. He or she actually has to start pedaling, and eventually the child's mind and body basically have a conversation, so to speak, with the bike to grasp the fundamentals of moving forward successfully. Same with AI. The only way to learn AI is to use AI. Helping human teams embrace this new co-intelligence (and it's not like there's a choice) falls under the umbrella of change management. That's a CEO's wheelhouse. It will take more than a few years for many humans to reconcile their minds and values with this new relationship, and it falls on the CEO's shoulders to steward that reconciliation. Likewise, CEOs oversee AI governance, policy and privacy. I've shared before how AI governance should be viewed less like a car brake and more like a steering wheel to inform, direct and accelerate AI adoption and integration. Lastly, only CEOs can scale long-term AI benefits and business outcomes effectively. You can't really delegate this. AI efforts will plateau at times, some or many AI experimentations will fail, and there are always staff members who will drag their feet because they just don't like AI. DMO CEOs are chief people officers and it's on them to create the right culture for scaling AI platforms and processes effectively for everyone in their crews. Agentic AI This is where things get interesting. AI agents and agentic commerce might sound super confusing for many or most staff members. Lots of land mines to watch out for, sure, but even more reasons for us building a macro DMO AI strategic framework. One of the key objectives for the AI Roadmap is to elevate AI agents and agentic commerce as the two interrelated cornerstones for AI strategy, and explain why. Doing so shows the true big picture value of AI, and it drives home how we eventually need to move way beyond training people the basics of prompting. Yes, it's intimidating, but we introduce the labels and contexts relating to agentic AI early on in the process. That gets some people thinking bigger about AI, and it entices the AI champions in the group to start experimenting with agents. AI Agents (Internal) For internal AI strategy, leading DMOs are developing AI agents and automated workflows to address the aforementioned 41% of time that staff members spend on grunt work and trying to find information. They are proven, they work, and most of all, they deliver measurable ROI. We're working with outside contractors at Matador to develop and implement agents and automations for both ourselves internally and for DMO clients. We are already seeing success, and there's been a recent influx among our people asking for agents. It's an amazing thing to see when staff members start requesting new AI integrations like that, proactively. That's when you know your AI strategy is working at least on some level. Agentic Commerce (External) AI agents are also the foundation for agentic commerce. According to Mastercard , "Agentic commerce is a new form of online and mobile shopping, in which an AI agent 'closes the loop' or completes tasks for a user — such as searching for items, comparing options and making a purchase — with limited or no manual inputs needed from that user. For example, while chatting in a generative AI app, you could tell the AI agent, 'Book me a nonstop flight to London for under $600 next week — no red-eyes,' and the agent will review airlines, nearby airports and your loyalty memberships and payment card rewards to identify the best option, purchase it and then share it with you." Just like with AI agents, developing agentic commerce architecture covers a wide spectrum of sophistication and capabilities. Going back to the analogy of flying a plane while building it with no clear final destination in mind, agentic commerce is the point on the map where we want to land. With GuideGeek, we have Kayak, GetYourGuide, Skyscanner and other booking tools integrated into the platform with a click-through UX/UI. Looking ahead, we're working with one national tourism organization to bring some of their national partners' booking engines (air, hotel, tour op, etc.,) into the platform to eventually convert sales in-chat. Subscribe to Mastercard Signals to keep up-to-date on agentic commerce and access intelligence like this Mastercard Payments Trends Navigator report. Staff Training & AI Integration Training staff and implementing AI processes across all departments is really the meat of the 2050 City Roadmap. But none of that should proceed without DMO leadership embracing all the above, and communicating it clearly to all staff. Easier said than done, though. Leadership needs to continually communicate a high-level approach to AI strategy, because it won't really click for many staff (or leadership) at the beginning of this process. That, of course, needs to be married with all the practical training initiatives we're continuing to develop. We've already learned a ton with the present work we're doing training DMO teams. Here are a few very basic takeaways just to start explaining our process. There are obviously many more educational modules following these, ranging from predictive analytics to specific department AI training in areas like HR, finance and legal. Conduct an internal AI survey asking all staff to share their perceptions and usage of AI. Follow that up with small group interviews across the organization, and transcribe everything with an AI notetaker. We use Granola, but there are many others. Also, explain to staff that all meetings regarding AI will be recorded to create an internal knowledge base to identify opportunities, challenges and takeaways over time. Start training with a focus on just the paid/pro models of ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. Some staff feel confused with the sheer variety of available AI tools in front of them. We explain that, at the end of the day, the basics of using AI include an end user, an AI tool, and a knowledge base. Get people on board with that, and then show how most of the AI tools they have access to are similar in many ways. One of the fastest methods to advance AI understanding is showing staff how to create custom GPTs in ChatGPT. Some team members will pick up on these quickly and start integrating them into their workflows right away. These are the people who typically make up your internal AI taskforce. Explain and show how Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot are AI workhorses that connect with the majority of people's daily workflows. However, humans tend to think of those as just the next evolution of search engines. This is mental wiring that needs to be broken. Gemini and Copilot are great/good in some ways, but I've found that training staff on just those three native LLMs first (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) is more effective for seeing the light. Google NotebookLM has a lot of fans. I like to walk teams through it because it's a good way to reinforce what a knowledge base is, like we do with the custom GPTs. Also, the automated audio and video podcasts are crowd pleasers, especially with the new Join function where users can engage directly with the agentic podcast hosts. People don't seem to want to read anymore. This was a rude awakening for us when we first launched the AI Roadmap with a series of online training materials. We now know we need to deliver short video instruction if we want anyone to actually look at the educational content. People love Descript for AI-powered video creation. Once we started showing how to use Descript, we were pleasantly surprised to see how staff really leaned in. Teaching Descript provides a fun break early in the process because people can see pretty amazing results in minutes and wrap their minds around the process fairly easily. Ask all staff to share how they're using AI effectively and where they see AI failing them. Catalogue the case studies and share across the organization to accelerate learning, inspire a healthy sense of internal competition, and track learning over time. Staff members are also often wowed seeing AI agents in action. We use n8n to develop agents, where you can create a lot of basic automated workflows quickly. Once a few early adopters see how agents can take over some of their more tedious, time-consuming tasks, others will jump in. Feedback Loop & Funding/Board Support This line in the AI Roadmap is broken down into tactical internal optimization and more strategic, consumer-facing and revenue-generating sales, marketing and stakeholder engagement. I don't have a lot to share for this section and the following one because our focus to date has been mostly on the above phases. Feedback Loop The reason we record every engagement with AI Roadmap clients is to scale learning, so if one person learns something, everyone can benefit. That will be further multiplied when we starting sharing takeaways across DMOS, and eventually the industry as a whole. Visit Mesa, Tourism Richmond and Visit Florida Keys are eager to lead this initiative, and we plan to launch a new AI thought leadership framework collectively in 2026. Funding & Board Support The spark that led to developing the AI Roadmap happened almost a year ago when a board member for a large DMO told me that she viewed AI integration as merely a tactic. If this work can elevate AI in the minds of board members toward a more high-level strategic imperative, then we'll have achieved part of our mission. There's still some work to be done first though to collect more case studies showing direct AI business outcomes before we can make a more solid case for additional funding for AI integrations. AI Strategic Plan We've produced a mockup of what we think an AI Strategic Plan will eventually look like, but it's too early to show presently. For now, we've identified three overarching pillars, each with potential strategies, action items, timelines and targets. The KPIs are crucial, of course, for scaling AI strategy across the travel industry. Right now, we're thinking the three pillars might look like the following, although this is all up in the air right now: Optimize Internal Operations & Knowledge: The strategies include cleaning up internal folders/files to improve AI outcomes in general and develop AI agents specifically. A lot in here on training, experimentation, overall adoption, success measures, etc. Increase Partner Revenue with Agentic AI: Defining how DMOs develop AI agents to fuel agentic commerce is the big goal overall with the AI Roadmap. Initial strategies in this pillar begin with more low hanging fruit though, such as website redevelopment, optimizing for AI SEO, AI chat integration, etc. Expand Community Collaboration: We're seeing more DMOs take a leading role in AI education for their industry and community stakeholders. The 2050 City Roadmap is perfectly suited for informing how DMO leaders can facilitate community AI workshops and increase the organization's overall relevance and value. Greg Oates

Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Kara Franker , president and CEO of The Florida Keys & Key West tourism organization, was among the first DMO leaders to embrace AI platforms and processes in 2023 when she was chief executive at Visit Estes Park in Colorado. In May 2024, Franker published two papers on AI strategy and policy: From the Base of the Rocky Mountains to the World: A case study through Visit Estes Park’s journey into Generative AI solutions — and how your DMO can carve its own AI path Navigating AI and the Law in the Travel Industry: An Introduction to Legal Implications for DMOs The first paper highlights how Visit Estes Park integrated GuideGeek AI chat into their website and three Meta platforms: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The DMO also branded the chat Rocky Mountain Roamer to give it an identity and bit of personality. The second paper focused on AI policy and data privacy, security and compliance. Franker, who is an attorney, co-wrote that with Roxanne Steinhoff , also an attorney at Steinhoff Law, who leads the firm’s destination marketing and sports tourism practice. I caught up with Franker to see how her perspectives on AI strategy and policy are evolving almost a year later. Greg Oates: You've been leading AI strategy in tourism for almost two years beginning with your work at Visit Estes Park. However, there’s still a lack of AI training today specific for DMO CEOs, and many leaders are presently unsure how to proceed with AI. As a CEO, what’s your take on that? Kara Franker: I'm not surprised that there's a lack of training because there's just so much for everybody to wrap their heads around. I think some people are trying to watch and wait and see. My philosophy has been more of a fall-forward, fail-forward kind of approach. That's why I put the white papers out. Anybody could learn from what we had done, and do it better. You know, a case study is sometimes the best way to figure this stuff out, so that's why we did it. The second paper on AI policy was with Roxanne Steinhoff on the legal and ethical implications of AI. Because when I would go and speak in front of groups, those were always the big questions from the leadership. They don't know how far is too far once you open this can of worms. That's why we got together and started to put guardrails in place that we thought might make sense for people to study, just as a first stab at it. That all launched last summer, so I do think that there's a little bit of education out there but we could definitely use more. GO: What do DMOs need to know about AI policy at a very high level in terms of privacy and security? KF: Employee and client information should be kept private and not uploaded into any AI tools. That could be a big deal, thinking of all the different rules and regulations about collecting information, especially how it's more stringent in Europe than in the United States. That can cause potential problems if you're uploading, say, a client list that has personal cell phones, email addresses or other information that people just don't want out there. So, it's really more about information that's attached to a person. And then, is there competitive data that you don't necessarily want others to have? Possibly, but so much of what we do in the DMO space is public anyways so the lines for that are pretty blurry. I’m trying to imagine a scenario where a DMO is, like, basically hacking somebody else's information through AI. I can’t imagine that’s worth the time and effort, or even possible. GO: A few months ago we were discussing what AI tools might be available for DMO departments like HR and accounting to help with privacy, compliance, efficiency, etc. But everything available seems to be enterprise grade and out of reach for DMOs. So what’s the answer for scaling AI across an organization? KF: I think this is a huge need. I hired somebody from Cisco who’s my new VP of technology and partnerships. She's a total AI nerd like I am, and way more qualified to dive into all this. She and I have been looking at different options to put together, almost like little plugins. We really, really need this. For example, how do we take an AI solution from the legal world to analyze all our contracts so that we don't have to spend as many hours with attorneys, because we really just need a template, right? And then for HR, same thing. How do we organize all our employee files into a much more streamlined and effective system? And then there’s our policies. We're a nonprofit but everything we do is so heavily influenced by County government. We have so many compliance issues, so I want an AI to learn every single piece of County policies so we’re able to compare and contrast what we're doing with those policies. I haven't been able to find anything to help with these things. We've looked at a lot of different options but it's like what you're saying. They're these big enterprise pieces built for law firms or financial people, and they’re all really expensive. None of them fit the mold for improving different operations at a DMO. In my mind, the marketing side is covered, especially with GuideGeek, and there are so many great options now for everything involved with marketing. So I feel like that's been tackled and done really well. But for the operations, we need more. I mean, we’ve just got to keep digging deeper, I think. GO: When you and your technology person from Cisco figure all this out, will you share what you find with the rest of us? KF: Of course, always. GO: Backing up a bit, you were arguably the very first DMO CEO to lean into AI, at least in North America, when you were with Visit Estes Park. How did you convince your board that investing in AI was important at the time, and what were some of your processes with bringing along staff? KF: We were fortunate in the sense that the board was all in and the staff were all in. And I don't mean to make age a part of it, but the staff was a little on the young side and they were all very ambitious. Everybody wanted to try to figure it out. So we made the argument to the board, if we could figure out some of what AI could do, it would make the community stronger and they could take pieces of it back to their businesses. There wasn't really anybody who was against experimenting and trying it out. We made some mistakes along the way and we put that in the white paper. Also, when we first rolled out GuideGeek, which scrapes the website, we found a few holes in our content. There were particular board members who didn't have very robust information about their business, so they got a little bit mad, but not in a, like, burn it down way. It was more of, "Oh, okay, we have some work to do." So part of the AI process has to actually be community outreach. It can't just be about the technology. We have to talk to all our partners and get really robust information from them, so when the AI crawls the site it gets the best possible information about our partners. GO: One thing you did at Visit Estes Park was brand your GuideGeek AI as Rocky Mountain Roamer on your website and three Meta platforms. We use that as a case study a lot, and emphasize that a DMO should promote their AI just like any other channel, right? KF: Definitely. We knew we had to put money behind marketing the tool if we wanted people to interact with it. Traditionally with a DMO, one of your calls to action is to send people to the website. Our new call to action for a lot of our campaigns back then was to send people to the AI, so we called it Rocky Mountain Roamer to help promote and drive traffic to it. And then in terms of KPIs, we wanted to track all the interactions you can see in the backend, but not just how many people used it. We wanted to know how long people interacted with the AI, what their journey was, and what they were asking about because that’s where things get really interesting. GO: After the initial thrill of launching GuideGeek, how did you manage how staff used AI internally? Were there any incentives involved to help spur adoption and experimentation? KF: The incentive for my team was, well, it wasn't really an incentive. It was a requirement. They had to write weekly reports for me about how they tested something with AI, whatever it was. It could apply to their job or not, I didn't really care. So I almost forced them to try AI. But then people started really getting into it. They were getting more and more user friendly with different AI tools, and they would be like, “Oh, I like Anthropic because of this or that,” because they were branching out from just using ChatGPT. So, yeah, there has to be almost like a culture of AI in your DMO for it to really work, and it's on the CEO to create and foster that. Greg Oates

Join Matador Network's AI Playground at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Matador Network, GuideGeek AI and U.S. Travel are launching the inaugural "AI Playground" at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix, August 17-19. The educational space, hands-on demo area, genius bar and live sessions will run all three days during the conference. We are also producing programming specific for travel industry CEOs, along with other sessions dedicated for senior executives, highlighting actionable AI strategies focusing on real world business outcomes. Leading up to ESTO, I'll be reaching out to many of you requesting any AI-related success stories and/or questions you might have for the AI Playground. Looking back over the last two years, it's clear the industry is turning a corner in 2025 when it comes to AI learning and adoption. Many DMOs and their industry partners are now integrating AI processes and platforms across their organizations, whereas last year many destination leaders were still in wait-and-see mode. For those of you still on the fringes, it is our ambition that the AI Playground will plant a flag in the ground showing how AI is now a proven strategy for helping DMOs further deliver on their mandate. "AI is clearly powering the future of travel and how people explore the world today," says Ross Borden, founder and CEO of Matador Network. "We are stoked to be working with U.S. Travel and investing in our industry to produce the AI Playground. AI will become standard operating procedure for every DMO soon, and we're excited to help lead this journey." DMO CEOs on AI Strategy Matador launched its proprietary GuideGeek AI chat platform for DMO websites and social media channels almost two years ago. We now have more than 40 DMOs onboard, and we're expanding the scope of GuideGeek AI with new hotel groups and tour operators joing in recent months. Based on our experience working with municipal, regional and national organizations across the global visitor industry, we have unparalleled insights into how conversational AI is changing the relationship between destinations and visitors, as well as how DMOs operate internally. In preparation for ESTO 2025, we launched this GuideGeek Destination AI newsletter in January to ramp up our industry outreach and further expand our understanding of how DMO leaders are navigating the rise of AI. Here are five stories from the newsletter that inform high-level decision making related to AI strategy, with input from more than 15 CEO DMOs: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI : Our first post with 12 DMO CEOs highlighted the wide range of questions they have. One asked for the five big AI questions he should know about. Another wants practical advice on five AI initiatives that he can implement, like, tomorrow. Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism : CEO Royce Chwin, who helms Destination Vancouver, shared why his organization was one of the first DMOs in the world to dive into AI. Destination Toronto & Visit Denver CEOs on the 5 Big AI Questions in Tourism : Two chief executives, Andrew Weir in Toronto and Richard Scharf in Denver, worked out what they believe are the five big AI themes/questions that DMOs need to focus on, as touched on in the first post. Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation : Newly installed Florida Keys CEO Kara Franker, who is also an attorney, shed light on AI policy, compliance and the need for more non-enterprise AI solutions for her organization. Visit Mesa CEO Launches New DMO AI Road Map : Another visionary DMO chief executive, Visit Mesa leader Marc Garcia is bringing a new level of structure and direction for integrating AI processes and platforms. Next up, Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau, will be discussing AI strategy from a business events perspective. I also met with Cody Chomiak, vice president of marketing at Travel Manitoba, who's really lighting a fire in Canada around AI thought leadership and adoption. He'll be sharing a few powerful AI case studies from his provincial marketing organization, both internal and visitor-facing. AI Playground at ESTO 2025 The AI Playground this year will feature three stations at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge . We will have our Matador GuideGeek team and U.S. Travel staff on hand to guide participants through the space, along with some invited AI experts from around the industry. We'll be digging into a handful of paid AI models including ChatGPT Plus/Teams, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro, Google AI Pro, Microsoft Copilot Pro and Manus. We'll show how AI is best navigated at DMOs by bucketing strategy into three unique categories: Search, Create and Sales. Specific use cases will include content generation and data analysis, AI SEO and AI-optimized web development, AI policy and governance, staff adoption, building custom GPTs for sales proposals, and automated workflows and AI agents, among others. The three stations are: The Prompt Lab welcomes all attendees to come in and test drive various AI models. The interactive, hands-on learning station will have multiple laptops for experimenting with AI tools for people of all skill levels. We'll have a bunch of paid AI models pre-loaded for live demos and one-on-one conversations showing how AI actually works and some of what it accomplishes across different departments. Feel free to bring your own laptop if you like. The Genius Bar is designed for individual and group Q&A about real world AI strategy, implementation and ROI. We'll be collecting all the questions posed to share with the broader industry afterward, so we'll have a couple crowdsourcing boards to help generate new ideas and explore new solutions. Reach out to me if you want to schedule time to talk during ESTO. The AI Theater seating area will host a range of AI-focused dialogues, micro-presentations and a few dedicated sessions designed for CEOs, as well as other senior executives. The programming schedule for all those will engagements be included in the ESTO agenda. Most importantly, all the conversations at the AI Playground will highlight tangible AI case studies and specific business outcomes. The 5 Big Questions About AI One of the best things to come out of all the interviews with DMO CEOs this year is our list of the five big AI questions that chief executives need to focus on. These questions will likely evolve a bit, but for now they're providing direction for how we're developing the AI Playground and how DMOs are moving forward with AI integration. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? I would love to hear your feedback on any the above and how we can make the ESTO 2025 AI Playground as valuable as possible for you and your teams. Reach out at greg@matadornetwork.com . Greg Oates

Visit Mesa CEO Launches New AI Roadmap Aug 25 Written By Greg Oates Visit Mesa in Arizona kicked off a new internal initiative this week to integrate AI processes and platforms across the organization. I worked with Visit Mesa to help develop their new DMO AI Roadmap, which provides a 5-phase strategic framework that most any visitor organization can use as a template. The project officially began this week during Visit Mesa’s spring board meeting to communicate why the organization is moving forward with AI to optimize the DMO’s value for Mesa’s visitor industry and the local community. Marc Garcia, CATP , president and CEO of Visit Mesa, has been eager to start this initiative. He was one of the dozen CEOs who contributed to the first GuideGeek Destination AI story a few months back, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI. For that deep dive into a CEO's mindset regarding AI, Garcia asked: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” The Visit Mesa DMO AI Roadmap answers those questions. “I've recognized that AI is extremely important not only for the world moving forward, but specifically for our industry,” Garcia explained at the beginning of this project. “We at Visit Mesa need to get out in front of it. Even as a small to medium-sized DMO with our budget, we've always taken pride in the fact that we’re typically at the forefront of the latest and greatest in terms of technology, and so this is just an extension of that.” The following is a high-level overview of the DMO AI Roadmap and each of the five phases. However, like all strategic planning, there is a big jump between developing a plan and executing it effectively. This is especially true with internal AI training. In any given organization today, there is often a wide breadth of how people perceive AI and how proficient they are with AI models. It will take time to educate and align everyone around shared benefits for the organizations and staff, expected processes, intended outcomes and success metrics. Visit Mesa AI Roadmap The DMO AI Roadmap is a structured, phased approach for educating staff and integrating AI across DMO departments. The goals for the roadmap are to optimize internal operations, enhance sales and marketing outcomes, inspire staff self-learning, future-proof the organization, and contribute to how well local industry and community leaders adopt AI best practices and benefit from them. There are two imperatives that should be established and agreed upon among leadership at the very beginning. Integrating AI processes and platforms is an imperative for the DMO to ensure its relevancy and long-term impact in the local visitor economy. If leadership doesn’t fully believe that, this strategic framework won’t work. AI proficiency is an imperative for staff members for their future growth and marketability. That said, you can’t really force people to embrace, learn and use AI intentionally, but the job market will. The following phases are highly fluid and some of the processes can be rolled out concurrently. Ultimately, these phases provide structure for effectively and responsibly implementing a new technology that has no precedent. Because of generative AI, machines can now do three things they haven’t been able to do before. They have the ability to reason, the ability to communicate, and the ability to generate stuff based on that reasoning and communication. Meaning, AI is messy. Integrating it into our daily workflows is also messy because it's challenging us to rethink our relationship with technology. But as Kate Yordi, director of marketing at Visit Mesa, said during the board meeting this week, “Finally, we have some direction.” Phase 1: Leadership Alignment & Staff Communication As discussed at length in previous Destination AI posts, the DMO CEO must make it clear to all staff that the organization prioritizes AI because the organization prioritizes being relevant. It certainly helps, as is the case with Visit Mesa, when the CEO is fully backed by the board to invest in AI integration. During the board meeting, one member asked, “What do you need from us, Marc?” That’s a good sign. For the DMO AI Roadmap to work, all leadership needs to not only have a basic understanding of AI tools, they need to actually use them as well on a regular basis. That goes a long way in driving agency across the organization. However, making that happen typically requires some C-suite training to explain the primary AI models more indepth: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot and/or Google Gemini depending on the specific workplace platform(s) the organization uses. Identifying and prioritizing just a handful of AI models like that brings a lot of clarity to the process right off the bat. You see people's shoulders relax when they're confronted with 5-6 AIs versus dozens. (Yes, VEED, Gamma, Manus, Sora, Granola, Slack AI, etc., are all really cool but let's not start there.) A common lament among DMO leadership related to AI is, “Where do we even start?” Leadership should then discuss and begin to answer the five big questions all CEOs face when navigating AI integration, as vetted in the aforementioned Destination AI post about what CEOs want regarding AI education: How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI (who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI) to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and quality of work? How do we redevelop our content and channels to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI for business purposes to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The next step in this phase, at a basic level, is communicating to staff why they’re being asked to embrace AI. The following is not meant to be comprehensive, but a CEO would likely want to articulate: The purpose of the AI Roadmap, guiding principles, and the phases and processes involved How AI integration will take time and people will evolve at different paces It’s ok if everyone feels like they’re building the plane while flying it Everyone is encouraged to use AI and will be supported, but there will also be guardrails in place AI adoption and use cases will become part of employee reviews, but traditional roles, responsibilities and key success metrics are still the priority "How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents." — Marc Garcia, president and CEO, Visit Mesa Phase 2: Staff Assessment & AI Task Force Sitting down and asking staff how they feel about AI and how/if they’re using it is a good way to begin. Depending on the size of the organization, this can be done with every staff member individually or a representative group from each department. Generally people fall into three camps when it comes to AI: 1) Those who are already using AI on a regular basis; 2) those who are curious and have experimented a bit, but they don’t actively engage with AI tools; and 3) those who don’t see much value in AI. This last group can also include people who outright oppose AI, but they make themselves apparent pretty quickly. Data also shows there is often a significant percentage of staff who use AI in secret because they’re not sure they’re allowed to use it for work purposes. The second way to collect staff sentiment and AI capacity is with a blind online survey asking everyone what they like about AI, what concerns them, how they feel about job security, what they want to learn, what they hope to achieve, etc. Everything is anonymous so you can expect a wide variety of feedback ranging from constructive/optimistic to fears of an impending robot apocalypse. Once complete, all the data should be synthesized into key takeaways for leadership and shared with staff to show a high level of transparency right from the beginning of this process. The second part of this phase is developing an AI task force. The value of this cannot be overemphasized. Choose a small group of AI champions from various departments to do three things: Provide direction for stewarding the various processes in each phase as effectively as possible from beginning to end Share constructive and thoughtful input they’re hearing from other staff members about how things are proceeding well and where there are challenges Help scale AI adoption across teams by showing how they’re using AI effectively to everyone else in the organization An internal AI task force or council is invaluable because the members are motivated and they want to learn. Mostly, their enthusiasm and success with AI will begin to rub off on many of their colleagues and inspire self-learning and greater adoption among the teams. But not all. There will be those who disengage, and there can be a significant number of them. Over time, they should be consulted to understand their trepidation, which should then be addressed. This is a challenge I'm having with one organization where a significant cohort are saying they're too busy to learn AI. Meanwhile, the majority of the staff are reporting daily usage with effective results, which definitely wasn't the case a few months ago. And even with those leaning in, the level of improvement and AI Iearning will be slow at times. This is why it’s critical for the CEO and the rest of management to be all-in and consistently participate in staff training sessions to show direction, intention and support. It’s very easy for the novelty of AI training to wear off after the first few months. This is where the AI task force can be instrumental to help maintain overall staff interest and keep engagement levels as high as possible. "Finally, we have some direction." — Kate Yordi, director of marketing, Visit Mesa Phase 3: AI Policy & Investments Developing an official AI policy and governance manual accomplishes two primary objectives: It protects the organization against legal and financial liability by establishing how all employees are required to use AI responsibly. It encourages and gives license for staff to proactively experiment with AI because there are clear guidelines in place about how to do so. There are many DMOs who have created AI policies and are willing to share with the rest of the industry. These are typically not lengthy documents (3-4 pages) nor full of legalese. Generally they’re written so every single employee can understand everything in them. Sections in these policies often include: Positioning/Purpose Statement: Expresses how and why the organization needs to be intentional about implementing AI processes Primary Objectives and Intended Outcomes: Defines the business case for how the organization is attempting to deliver on its core mandate of driving revenue to local businesses in alignment with community priorities Guiding Principles: Establishes the principles of responsible AI use in alignment with the values of the organizations related to themes such as inclusivity, bias, authenticity, veracity, collaboration, knowledge sharing, etc. AI Definitions: Provides clear explanations of AI terminology used in the document and workplace AI Tools: Identifies specific AI models that the organization provides access to Data Input: Dictates clear rules about what employees can upload into AI models and what they can’t upload, such as personal information of any person Monitoring: Defines how the organization reserves the right to monitor AI practices Training & Support: Defines opportunities for professional growth and learning AI on an ongoing basis There are other items that DMOs might include in the above list, and they vary depending on how HR, financial and legal departments interpret AI governance, but it serves as a foundation. One key consideration for DMO leadership when it comes to policy is identifying which pro AI models to invest in. Paid AI tools provide higher levels of privacy and security because AI companies don’t train on them, or at least there’s the choice to select that option. Many DMOs, for example, purchase annual subscriptions for paid ChatGPT Team accounts ($25 per employee monthly) for staff to use for work, which is a first step for protecting the IP and other interests of the organization. Other paid AI models are then provided to specific departments based on need and the specific attributes of the tools, such as Claude for marketing and social media staff because many consider it the best AI for content creation. Phase 4: AI Education & Implementation This is the most important thing in training teams to embrace and use AI effectively. You want to foster an environment where structured learning evolves into self-learning. That’s the only way this scales. When staff members with little experience in AI start exploring how to use AI on their own, and they start helping their colleagues see new ways to use AI, that’s a pretty special thing. From an education standpoint, the DMO AI Roadmap begins at a high level defining AI’s place in online history. AI is the third transformational shift since the PC was invented, including: The mainstream web/internet in the 1990s; the evolution of mobile/social/cloud and apps in the 2000s; and gen AI in the 2020s. These are the only three times when big tech went all-in and pivoted their business models around a new technology. I then break AI training into the following buckets, and again, this is all very surface level and not meant to be comprehensive. Also, creating engaging demos are everything, and that's not also easy because AI demos can be a real slog sometimes. But, showing how different AIs provide real value is key for people to internalize their learning and use it more intuitively over time: Explain how pre-gen AI tech is deterministic and gen AI is probabilistic, which messes with a lot of people’s minds. Gen AI outputs are based on statistical patterns and probabilities, just like the human brain processes ideas and information. Traditional tech is based on absolutes, delivering the same output based on the same input. Old tech is about information. AI is about knowledge. Spend a lot of time on this with workshops and demos. Highlight the capabilities of only three AI models to start: ChatGPT for brainstorming and planning; Claude for writing and data analysis; and Perplexity for conversational search. The other two, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, are more general purpose. They also do amazing things (Gemini 2.5 Pro is great for reasoning), but focusing on the first three will provide direction at the beginning so people don’t get overwhelmed. At the very minimum, leadership should have a basic understanding of those three. Explain how AI search isn't 100% perfect but it's a 1,000% better than old search. Define how DMOs and all brnads are redesigning their websites and content strategy to optimize for AI search, and the basics of AI SEO . I would argue the most important thing for using AI is really understanding how generative AI = conversational AI. It's a dialogue. It's called "chat" for a reason. This is where I’ve heard the most positive feedback from teams I’ve worked with. It happens when people move beyond the Google mindset—where search is one and done—and they see the real value of iterative conversations with AI models that evolve with each exchange in the discussion, just like a human conversation. This also removes some misperceptions about how to prompt. Yes, there are some basic rules about how to prompt well. But beyond that, it’s vastly more beneficial to explore AI conversations further with thoughtful follow-up prompts that flow logically and organically to achieve the best results. Explore how the real value of AI extends beyond just efficiency and productivity gains. That's a dangerous dialogue with staff who can construe that as leading to more work or being terminated over time. The bigger value and better narrative is how AI increases creativity and knowledge, and how those both influence overall quality of work, marketing effectiveness, sales productivity, staff culture and pride, job satisfaction and growth opportunities, etc. Really dig into the advanced features of the paid models: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro. Aside from the added security and privacy they provide, they offer functions not available in the free models and their outputs are significantly better. ChatGPT Projects and custom GPTs, Claude Projects and Perplexity Spaces are where the magic happens. Create an environment where staff members are eager to share their successes with AI with the rest of the organization. This feedback loop is critical for steering education and driving adoption, and it’s one of the most important roles for the internal AI task force. AI-training meetings can be highly effective during video calls but they often have the greatest impact during in-person workshops. Also, make sure to give staff a specific amount of hours during the week to develop their AI skills. Explore options for AI chat platforms and the benefits they provide for visitors and local industry partners. I work with Matador Network, which developed the industry leading GuideGeek AI chat platform. The feedback from 35+ DMO clients is impressive and irrefutable, but there is still much work to do educating visitors and industry about AI chat strategy and their benefits to continually increase adoption and business outcomes. The DMO AI Roadmap also provides guidance for developing various learning and engagement formats: Schedule weekly or bi-weekly meetings specifically, and only, for AI training with both internal and external people sharing insights Create a library of AI educational materials for staff to reference Start a weekly internal AI newsletter to share how teams are using AI Start a Slack or similar channel dedicated for AI education, AI news updates, knowledge sharing, etc Start a weekly and optional one-hour AMA meeting for everyone to ask everyone else questions (highly effective) Create a regular schedule for staff to report back to leadership or department heads about how they’re using AI and what they’re achieving with it Phase 5: Success Tracking I kick off every AI presentation identifying the three AI models mentioned above—ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity—followed by the assertion that, "AI is the death of 'I don't know.'" That is arguably the biggest ROI for integrating AI in a DMO or any other type of organization. There are few questions that are too complex or too intimidating for DMO staff to approach with confidence and conviction if they know how to use those three AI models effectively. I shared an example previously where I used Perplexity Pro to educate myself about how board governance is evolving . That for me was something I knew was out of my realm of expertise, but now I feel I can speak with some semblance of authority about that to any board because of AI. Before gen AI, I dismissed board governance as one of those things I'd just have to leave in the dark. That said, trying to explain how AI helps staff become more self-reliant, where they can always build a foundation of understanding for anything to empower themselves, only goes so far with a board. They're looking for more quantitative KPIs. Here are just some examples of that in a DMO context. In 2025, defining KPIs for AI integration is an evolving science, and we as an industry are still figuring a lot of this out. Therefore, this list is nowhere near comprehensive and it will evolve, but we have ample data today to validate the following: Using AI for search and content development saves significant time and increases opportunities for higher output and increased creativity for producing blog posts, social media, videos, marketing campaigns, etc. Developing custom GPTs (in ChatGPT Plus) for group sales is a proven strategy for creating better, more customized proposals in much less time. That gives sales staff more time for brainstorming and prospecting leading to higher production. That's a fact. In this case, group sales people are actually pumped to try a new technology. Using AI for regression analysis and scenario modeling increases the accuracy of how DMOs predict visitor volumes year-round, event attendance, economic impact, etc. One of the biggest conversations in DMOs today is how to develop content and websites to rank higher in AI search. Developing best practices in AI SEO leads to higher traffic. That is a core mandate for any DMO, and no DMO can afford to ignore that over time. AI chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI are driving real business. As described in PhocusWire in March, New York City Tourism + Conventions launched its GuideGeek-powered "Ellis" meeting-specific AI chat in January. ROI to date: 100% increase in traffic to the meeting planner website, 800+ AI-driven queries in the first month, 50% growth in newsletter sign-ups, and 10% increase in time spent on the site. Summary The AI train has left the station and it's gaining steam. The DMO AI Roadmap is the next logical step for helping DMO CEOs and their teams integrate AI processes and platforms. As Visit Mesa's Kate Yordi said, "Finally, we now have direction." That's a big deal for DMO staff to feel that way. Generative AI has been with us for more than two years now, but a structured and phased approach for integrating AI across DMO departments has been the missing piece. Visit Mesa's DMO AI Roadmap is going to evolve as the team works through the process, but at least now there's a vision and scope. Visit Mesa CEO Marc Garcia and the board are fully committed—a critical first step for embarking on this journey. Also, this strategic framework for how DMOs approach AI is going to underpin the interactive AI Playground activation at U.S. Travel's upcoming ESTO conference in Phoenix, August 17-19. U.S. Travel and GuideGeek are partnering to develop educational programming for the hands-on AI training experience and series of thought leadership. Greg Oates

How AI Improves DMO and Community Master Planning Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Many DMOs are developing 10-year destination master plans to optimize their visitor economy in alignment with local community priorities. I've participated in producing dozens of them from Miami to Mesa. They often take as long as a year to complete because there's so much focus on community engagement in various formats: interviews, focus groups, town halls, surveys, visioning sessions, etc. The tourism industry talks about the importance of community a LOT. However, when you're working with a DMO, you never really dig into what actually moves the needle across so many endless community demands, not on a tactical and hyperlocal level. You're not really held accountable for any measure of success when it comes to community-specific initiatives, ranging from improving City Hall permitting processes for small businesses to tracking the movement of unhoused. A master plan needs to address those and amplify those kinds of pressing needs for the destination overall. The expectation is not really to fix them. That’s not the role of a DMO. It's a whole different ballgame when you're developing a long-term strategic framework for a community organization like Near Southside, Inc . in Fort Worth. Success and being accountable for fixing things is expected. Located at the periphery of the downtown core, Near Southside is the most interesting community in North America right now. The ex-industrial district can be loosely compared to Austin 20 years ago with the same cultural DNA and similar community values, based on a fiercely protective love for local, creative and independently owned small businesses. That's under threat. In the last few years, as Near Southside evolved into the coolest 'hood east and west of the Pecos Line, real estate prices are rising commensurately. We all know how this story often ends with the encroachment of national brands sanitizing the soul of a place that made it attractive in the first place. Near Southside is intent on rewriting that story. AI Processes for Strategic Planning Here's where AI comes in. Because of the multitude of overlapping challenges and evolving dynamics in the community, our team needs to crunch and debate a ton of qualitative and quantitative data. Addressing gentrification touches on so many aspects of how communities operate. Therefore, we are over-indexing on community engagement to get as many perspectives as possible to identify how the community best evolves in the face of rapid change. The amount of inputs we're getting is substantive, and we want to inventory all of it as thoroughly as possible to build a super comprehensive knowledge base for the AI to cull through, connect dots and output insights. Every individual zoom call with stakeholders is recorded with Granola AI, which produces full transcripts but the summaries are too light. So we created custom GPTs with instructions for everything we want in the summaries, including comprehensive overviews, key takeaways with detailed context for each, the most insightful quotes related to those takeaways, and all action items that stakeholders recommended. With the GPT, we can fire full transcripts into the chat, press "enter" and receive highly valuable, high quality and uniform summaries almost immediately. We're doing the same with the focus groups but the custom GPTs require a different set of instructions. The two-hour transcripts capture the conversations with 10-20 stakeholders convened across specific industry and community segments. For those, the GPTs bucket corresponding high-level takeaways and tactical action items related to the same theme. That has immeasurable value because these conversations are all over the place. It's great working with locals who are so passionate about where they live and how, but that means you're getting feedback from a firehose and someone taking notes doesn’t capture all the nuance. Using custom GPTs to produce these summaries and populate takeaways is as good or better than any team could do manually. Everything is stored in Airtable. Forget Google or Microsoft cloud platforms. Airtable is an AI-powered, relational database/spreadsheet beast for organizing data and automating basic workflows. The tables combine all project information in one place, such as a running list of pending/completed interviews and focus groups and their AI-generated summaries. Airtable can then auto-generate a summary of the summary in the same table for clients to easily review everything being collected on a daily basis to whatever degree they prefer. Once you use Airtable, you'll never look at Google Drive the same way again. I've never had so many insights so well organized, so thorough and so easy to share with a team and client to help inform each project phase. The client loves the transparency, immediacy and structure, naturally, versus waiting for the next weekly update to read a few bullet points in a PowerPoint. Here's the thing. Because we've been so intentional about collecting such a high quality and comprehensive volume of feedback, we have a motherlode of a knowledge base for AI to work with. We can then enter all that in bulk into Google NotebookLM or ChatGPT/Claude Projects to pull out anything from high-level aggregate takeaways to anything super customized or tactical. For example, the client was interested in hearing specifically just what developers had to say about gentrification. I wanted highlights related to anything discussed regarding City Hall processes. It’s super easy to pull reports together for those and anything else. Ultimately, you can use AI to deliver an outline, a strategy map and a very rough draft of a destination master plan. All you need to do is combine all of the above together, plus PDFs of all relevant public and private planning documents, PDFs of all relevant case studies and best practices, and detailed instructions about the purpose, elements, structure, etc., of the plan. People will disagree, sure. I'm not dismissing the expertise of people who put these things together, because they bring deep context to every conversation and decision made during the development of a master plan. Everything happening now in Near Southside has happened somewhere else. When you can bring takeaways from those places to any present situation, it helps provide direction for everyone in the room. Again, I’m not saying that AI is replacing humans. People get all kinds of worked up over that, especially in travel and tourism. I am saying you can create a better, more strategic and more informed master plan in a much more streamlined fashion when you employ AI strategically to better prepare a community for the future. That's just a fact. I have four more community focus groups today in Near Southside. The expectation among everyone is that their contributions will make a demonstrable difference in their neighborhood. We can’t just speak to the challenges. We need to fix them and our processes with AI are giving everyone more confidence that we can deliver on that. Wondering how many DMOs are interested in employing similar AI-first strategies to get a better handle on how to help their communities. Greg Oates

How Visit Richmond is Using AI to Sell More Conventions Aug 2 Written By Greg Oates DMO CEOs want specific use cases for AI showing how they drive measurable business results. Here's a great example for capitalizing on AI to drive meetings and conventions volume from Lauran Peoples , director of sales marketing and business development at Visit Richmond in Virginia. Peoples works in the organization's 13-person sales team and reports to the VP of sales. Her role has three core functions: She is the main liaison between the destination sales and marketing departments; she develops and leads campaign strategy for the sales department; and she works with her colleagues to optimize strategic partnerships. Peoples' role is somewhat unique as a liaison between sales and marketing in that she lives on the sales side, versus marketing. She also stands out in our industry as an emerging voice in AI innovation. If you're going to U.S. Travel's ESTO conference this month in Phoenix, look for her and me working in the show's inaugural AI Playground educational activation. Greg Oates: Can you explain your role at Visit Richmond, specifically in terms of how you bridge the sales and marketing teams? Lauran Peoples: It's becoming more common in DMOs for sales teams to have a marketing liaison, but usually that person is based on the marketing team and is mostly assigned to sales to help with creative. The issue is when that marketing liaison is based on the marketing team, they don't have much exposure to the field and what's happening out of market with your salespeople. Our sales team has 45 trade shows this upcoming fiscal year, so they're traveling almost every week. With my situation in Richmond, they're getting real-time data and downloads about what's happening in each destination, so that gives them more authentic conversations to engage planners. Not having someone assigned to a team like that creates a huge disconnect and leaves opportunity on the table. GO: Tell us a little about your journey with AI. LP: I've been working in hospitality for 20 years. Last year, I heard some younger people on the team talking about ChatGPT. So I was like, okay, I don't know anything about that. I went to PCMA Convening Leaders in January and the opening session was all about AI. I remember sitting there feeling like a dinosaur. Feeling very behind. I realized this is a lot more serious and widespread than I thought, so I left and tasked myself with using ChatGPT once a day. Initially, I couldn't differentiate how it wasn't like Google. I was asking it how many tablespoons are in this or that, kind of thing. Since then, my understanding of AI has progressively increased around more complex and comprehensive capabilities. It has streamlined my productivity, but more importantly, AI has become a thought partner for me to bounce all these ideas and scenarios around that I didn't have before. I think that a lot of people are adopting AI and using it as a communications assistant, or a writing assistant. But the part for me that's really exciting and valuable with AI is analyzing and aggregating data and getting it to show you things that you need help with, like sales. GO: Can you share an example? LP: Sure. I took five datasets: five years of lost business, five years of definite business, and three marketing reports from different campaigns we were running with outside agencies like Sojourn and Digital Edge. Those campaigns give us demographic insights because we were targeting certain areas. I also grabbed our sales deployment sheet, which tells you who has what market. I uploaded all of those into ChatGPT and asked it to identify the top five locations for each of our managers based on their market segments. Some results weren't surprising, but there were a few that popped up like Orlando that we've never traditionally considered. When I asked ChatGPT why Orlando, it showed how the city has a large hobby market. It turns out there are a lot of hobby conventions that meet in Orlando. After I compiled the top five locations for each manager, I asked ChatGPT to give me the top five accounts in each of those locations. Then I asked for unique selling propositions for each of those accounts as to why Richmond would be a perfect fit. Finally, I asked it to rank those five destinations based on probability of success. GO: Have you seen any of this result in new business opportunities? LP: Yes. One location that showed up was Philadelphia. Richmond is four hours from Philadelphia, but like Orlando it hasn't typically been on our radar. However, based on the data from ChatGPT, Philly came up as a recommendation. So we sent one of our sales managers to Philadelphia, and she ended up hosting 18 planners, including some who drove from over an hour away to see her. She got such a great response that I had to jump in and go with her because she couldn't host 18 clients by herself. AI has now informed our sales strategy for Philly, and the region is now part of our dedicated sales strategy. We've allocated funds for that sales manager in Philly to join chapters of organizations like MPI and PCMA. So that's how we know there had to be some accuracy to our approach with AI. GO: How do the sales managers feel about you doing this AI analysis? LP: They appreciate it. It's a balance because most sales managers at DMOs aren't entry level; they've been in hospitality for a long time. This is a new process and a new tool for them. Some have destinations they like to go to over and over because they're successful there. But my role is to support business enablement and sales enablement to help them do what they do better and uncover new business. So how we're using AI provides them with additional actionable research. GO: I think one of the most underrated strategies for AI is developing custom GPTs in ChatGPT to help sales teams develop more customized and effective proposals more quickly. Are you building those at all? LP: Yes, definitely. About a month and a half ago, I programmed a GPT for the sales team called "Prospecting Partner." It's trained on our sales collateral and all our information, so it knows our convention packages and understands our jurisdiction and seven localities. The sales managers have been using it to prospect smarter. I included suggested prompts to go beyond just, "Give me a prospecting email." We can get really specific, like, "Help me re-engage an association planner who just lost grant funding." It also provides strategies specifically related to that, and then you can ask how to execute those strategies. So, for example, we know from reports that finance and insurance is an opportunity market for us. It's a small percentage of our current business but it has the highest average daily rate, which makes it very attractive to our hotel partners. So our salespeople are asking ChatGPT for ways we can develop business in the finance and insurance market, and really dig into that. Ultimately, AI is helping our sales team think bigger, smarter and more strategically. I've asked the sales team if they found this helpful, and, you know, salespeople are not an easy crowd. They said yes across the board. With the ChatGPT Enterprise version, I can't see their exact prompts due to privacy, but I can see the number of conversations they're having with the tool, so I know they're actively using it. GO: How are other people on your team using AI? LP: My two direct reports are our CRM database administrator and our sales coordinator. My sales coordinator does support work for the entire team, so she's using ChatGPT a lot for ideation, like when a sales manager needs an itinerary to entertain clients in Chicago. My CRM database administrator uses ChatGPT as a communication assistant because sometimes analytical personality types can benefit from exploring more communication nuances. She's also started incorporating it into data cleanup, using it to analyze reports and suggest what's missing or what would be beneficial. She uses it to help fill in gaps and identify what's not being asked or said. GO: What are some of your future plans with AI? LP: We're launching microsites for destination sales and sports, and I think it will set a model for the rest of the organization because we’re replacing our website from pre- to post-AI, like most DMO sites these days. We're currently writing copy for the microsites, and I've been getting into structured data and semantic clarity. You don't search ChatGPT or prompt ChatGPT with the same language you search Google, so content has to be written differently. Previously, you'd go to Google and say "restaurants near me." Now with ChatGPT, it's more of a conversation, so you'll say, "Hey, I'm in Scott's Addition historic district in Richmond with my kids, and we're looking for a vegan restaurant." That semantic clarity allows AI to respond with much more specific answers. I think we need to anticipate AI searches, as opposed to Google searches, in how we write content. Everyone is subconsciously expecting a personally curated experience today. When I go on Amazon, I'm expecting it to make connections that I like this, so I might also like this, without me having to tell it certain things. That's where we have to move towards, or we get eclipsed or become obsolete, especially if we're just thinking of ourselves as brokers for a destination. Greg Oates

Visit Phoenix CEO on Leading AI Strategy and Being Chill About It Jul 28 Written By Greg Oates I learned a lot about how DMO leaders can confidently integrate AI processes into their organizations after speaking with Ron Price, CDME, president and CEO of Visit Phoenix. Price is somewhat new to AI but his staff have been doing cool things with various LLMs for a while. He says his primary role with AI is providing the Visit Phoenix team with an enabling environment for success built on a culture of trust. Price accomplishes that by inspiring everyone to experiment with AI, be aware of the liabilities, share their wins, have fun with it, reach out to others for advice, and most of all, validate everything. Although, what stood out for me the most talking with Price is his calm and clear approach to AI, basically inferring (in my words, not his)... "We got this. We might do something amazing today with AI or we might not, but either way we're fully committed to seeing what it can do. We're also going to figure this AI thing out by collaborating with our many DMO industry friends. Because AI is going to change everything in a hurry, and we at Visit Phoenix are not going to be caught staring out at a Sonoran sunset while the world passes our city by." That's the vibe I got. That's leadership. That's what being a CEO means, at least for me. AI is confusing, sure, and CEOs have to worry about their boards and electeds. The thing is, we're more than two and a half years into generative AI now, and it's not going to wait for CEOs to decide if they can "trust AI" or not. I think we can all learn from Price a few things: We can de-escalate all the hubris and hand-wringing surrounding AI by being open to possibilities and having a clear set of principles, especially related to responsible AI use and verification. You can have fun with AI and focus on business outcomes at the same time. The DMO industry needs to collaborate and share best practices more intentionally to accelerate AI education, innovation and integration. We must encourage DMO staff to use AI today so they can steer the future of our industry tomorrow. Price likes talking about AI. I would encourage any DMO CEOs on the fence with AI to reach out to him. Greg Oates: Ron, how do you use AI? Ron Price: I use AI every single day, going back now about a month and a half. I'm just fascinated and interested in what it's able to do. I wouldn't say I'm an early adopter, of course, although there are some people who aren't even on it yet. Me personally, I use it for everything, like if I'm curious about something that's happening within the region. Or maybe I want to quickly compile a lot of data to help solve a problem or answer questions as I get ready for different meetings. More or less, my brain is always just firing, like, "What if we tried this or that?" And so, this year has been a cool realization about what AI can do, and seeing how it's pulling all the sources through to validate what it responds with. We have also integrated AI with Microsoft Copilot. We pay for everyone to have access to that, and then we also have a ChatGPT Team account for our staff. GO: Where else are you seeing value with AI at Visit Phoenix? RP: In our world, it's marketing, it's content. I love being surrounded by people who can write really well. It's an art to me, and I don't possess that art. It's like someone playing the piano. I'm in awe of that. So AI gives people the ability to write better, and it's okay to lean into it. Don't feel threatened by it. AI is able to give you that one golden nugget, or it suggests that one good idea that can really help someone when they're writing. Here's the fun part. Every day, we're learning something unique. We have the Cronkite School of Journalism in Phoenix, and some of the students are here. We kind of give them free rein, and we're also teaching them at the same time. The way that they use AI is amazing. It's fun to walk down the hall to see them because I'm always like, "How did you write that? How did you create that image? How did you pull that data and research together?" It's just a different generation. We're also seeing where our people are asking AI things like, "If I'm a salesperson, how do I influence a group to come here in the middle of the summer for a conference? Why is it fun to be here for a conference when it's 110 degrees out?" And what does AI have to say? Well, one thing that's great about, say, Grok, for example, it's pulling from all these little texts on Twitter, or X. They're from people saying, "Hey, I know it's summertime in Phoenix but look what I got to do." Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use. GO: Does your staff using AI increase your organization's impact in the community? RP: We not only focus on growing tourism in our community, but we're also joined at the hip with economic development. We look at our role as we're here to build a better community through tourism. And so, when you think about utilizing all the data out there, we always ask ourselves, "How could AI help us consolidate that data and crunch the numbers faster to give us a clearer picture of what we think we know?" For example, how much business that comes in through our leads touch our priority sectors? And of those sectors, which ones align extremely well with what we're doing here at Visit Phoenix? Is it semiconductors? Is it bio-med? Is it something that leans into the engineering side because of what ASU and the Department of Defense are doing? We've seen we can go back and look at the data and get a better picture of those things now. Also, as an example, we have a high propensity to book business around the semiconductor space. So we're utilizing these AI tools to quickly do research like, "Give me a list of the top semiconductor conferences that take place around the world." The responses are quicker and the results are better versus doing a traditional Google search. It's able to pull from a lot of different sources, so that's another way we're using AI. “Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use.” GO: How do you define the role of a CEO to guide a DMO forward with AI? RP: Setting up the rules of the game is important. There are areas of liability we have to be aware of about what you can and can't be pulling in. Those are the types of things we needed to figure out, you know, basically, "What is our rule book for using AI?" I like giving people the ability to use AI as they will. I think it works best whenever people know that it's a tool we want them to utilize. And if it can help us at the end of the day tell a better story, be smarter as we go after business, and be smarter with our analytics to help build our marketing strategy stronger, then use it. I try to build a team of leaders so they're CEOs of their own divisions, and I want them to be thought leaders in their areas. Also, I think AI enables us to get to answers quickly, but, and this is important, how do we validate those answers? We're really good at Visit Phoenix when it comes to validating answers, but we're usually doing it by going the long way and understanding how AI responded like it did. We're reading source by source by source, and then we kind of come to our own conclusion. It's like we're not just focused on the punch line of a joke. We can also tell you the structure of the joke. You always have to validate. We get excited about using AI because it just puts us in a new position. I think it's good to have a CEO that supports that, but that support comes from a trust within the organization. I trust that people are going to utilize AI to help make us better. GO: What keeps you up at night regarding AI? RP: My fear is how do we control and ensure that someone isn't producing something negative on our behalf, and then launching it to the world, and using this incredible tool to hurt us? Because there are people that are extremely gullible who believe whatever they're looking at. That's kind of where my brain goes sometimes. It's only because of what I've already seen these tools can do. I think across the DMO industry, we'll have some "ahas," especially when we get together in various forums to exchange ideas. We need to be talking with each other about, "Here are some things that work really well with AI, and here are the headwinds." And then, "These are the things you need to realize could happen with AI, and here are some ways you can mitigate those problems." The more we can learn from others about how they're using AI, the better. I think what you're putting together about AI strategy with all your insights is going to be extremely valuable. GO: Thank you. So, what are you thinking about next with AI? RP: As AI continues to grow, and we've talked about it here internally, what is the value of a website? In fact, we just started our next fiscal year, July 1. Website visits is no longer a key metric that we're going after. As a leader, I like knowing what's three steps ahead. We currently have these tools, but how are they going to change the way we make decisions going forward? At some point, a lot of what we're talking about now is going to be white noise. And what then? It doesn't mean our jobs of promoting a destination change. It means we're going to get so much better at telling our story through so many different avenues. I believe that our reach is actually going to broaden. We're still going to be responsible for promoting our destination and selling our destination, but how we tell the story and how we show the story is going to change as these tools evolve. Back in the day, a lot of us were reading about Moore's Law and how things just keep improving and getting cheaper, especially in technology. Now we're moving into a space where the rate of growth with AI is going to be something we've never seen before. Greg Oates

German Convention Bureau Leader on the Future of AI-Powered Meetings Jul 27 Written By Greg Oates After the global financial crisis ended in 2011, a few cities and nations around the world began promoting themselves to meeting and convention organizers based on their intellectual capital, versus venues and attractions. Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau (GCB), led this strategy in Europe at the time. Around the same year, I was visiting the House of Logistics & Mobility (HOLM) think tank in Frankfurt. The GCB suggested I visit there to better understand this new direction for attracting high-value business events in advanced industries. "The city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," Dr. Stefan Walter told me, who was a professor at HOLM at the time. "So, this [GCB] strategy is about finding the strengths of our strengths, our core competencies, and for Germany, that’s knowledge and infrastructure. It’s also about connecting ideas.” That has been my due north working in the travel industry ever since. This idea that meeting planners and attendees can tap into a deep knowledge base in a host destination, specific to their interests, for me, is intoxicating. The challenge is it takes a ton of work connecting local leaders in specific advanced industries, like aviation in Frankfurt or e-mobility in Stuttgart, with large global organizations in those same industries and convince them to bring their big annual event to Germany. It's also pretty high level. From an attendee standpoint, if I'm in Hamburg and want to learn about HafenCity, the largest urban makeover in Europe, it's not like I can easily access a bunch of people and organizations leading the future of urban development. Which, would be cool, right? AI is helping make that a reality. Germany's national Open Data/Knowledge Graph project is an ambitious AI-powered initiative to build a massive network of industry suppliers, academic organizations and business leaders across the country. Basically, by indexing the visitor industry and intellectual capital supply chain, Germany can connect the brightest minds in Germany with the rest of the world more seamlessly, effectively and equitably. An "interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," if you will. I spoke with Mr. Schultze to learn more about how AI is impacting the meetings and convention industry in Germany. Greg Oates: How is AI evolving across Germany's visitor industry? Specifically, how are your municipal CVBs and other partners thinking about and using AI right now? Matthias Schultze: Like much of the world, things really accelerated for us around two years ago with the rise of tools like ChatGPT. Suddenly, everyone, from corporates to associations, started thinking seriously about AI. We saw an opportunity and created an innovation platform called ebx.lab . It’s a peer-to-peer learning community for event planners, where we partner with scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute to explore how AI might reshape the business events space. From those early sessions, we have published a few white papers and identified a few core insights. AI clearly has potential to personalize experiences, optimize event planning processes, improve engagement and networking, and maybe most exciting, support predictive analytics. That last one, especially, being able to anticipate trends or behaviors based on data, is what feels most transformative to me personally. GO: How is the GCB embracing AI internally? MS: We developed our own internal AI strategy for the German Convention Bureau. We wanted to give both our team and our stakeholders a shared framework, something that outlined where we are today, where we want to go, and how we get there. It’s called "Driven by People, Powered by Data," and that title really reflects our belief that AI is a tool, not a solution in itself. People need to lead the process. The strategy helps us clarify not just what we can do with AI, but also what we can’t or shouldn’t do, at least not yet. It outlines our roadmap and aligns everyone across our organization and membership. GO: Is that strategy available publicly? MS: Yes, though only in German for now. But with the right AI tools, you can translate it quickly. The strategy touches on everything from marketing and communications to event planning, workflow automation, customer personalization, sustainability, and even ethics and compliance. The ethics component is particularly important. As exciting as AI is, we have to keep guardrails in place. Within our organization, we’re working hard to ensure that AI isn’t something siloed or limited to leadership. It needs to be embedded across every level. Everyone in the organization is expected to develop basic AI literacy. We’ve also worked on minimum viable products for things like dashboards and customer-facing chatbots. Some are already in use today. GO: You've always been a strong and vocal proponent for sustainability in business events. How is AI supporting you there? MS: I’m very proud of a project we developed with 29 other European countries: the Sustainability Hub for Events . It’s an AI-driven platform that brings together all kinds of sustainability related data—certifications, guidelines, best practices—and makes them accessible through an interactive AI agent. Planners can ask things like, “Can you help me build a sustainable menu?” or input event details to estimate their CO₂ footprint. It’s highly practical, and it’s making a real difference for event planners who need fast, reliable and actionable sustainability information. GO: We've talked about your Open Data and Knowledge Graph project in Germany numerous times in the past. Is that now live? MS: It’s technically live but still in progress, and probably always will be, in a sense. We’re continuously expanding it. The Open Data Germany project by the German National Tourist Board is live with its Knowledge Graph. The Open Data MICE project, which is implemented in close cooperation with the GNTB, is not yet live. One exciting element launching soon is an interactive map of research institutions in Germany. It will show where key research and innovation is taking place, including medical tech, renewable energy and so on, and link that data to infrastructure like hotels and conference venues. The idea is to visualize Germany as a knowledge landscape. If you’re planning an event and you want to anchor it around a theme like urban mobility, the map will show you which regions are most active in that field and match you with the relevant venues and experts. GO: One theme I keep obsessing about, and it's felt like a bit of a fantasy for more than a decade, is that the city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine. That idea is a direct quote from your House of Logistics and Mobility in Frankfurt, and it’s stuck with me ever since I heard it back in 2011. It's this idea of a city as a platform. Do you think we're getting closer to executing on this idea, where innovation at all levels is more accessible and shareable for more people? Ultimately what we're talking about here is the democratization of knowledge and excellence. MS: I love that idea. I really do. I think there are two layers to it. On one level, we have the smart city movement with systems that integrate transportation, energy, data and infrastructure to make better decisions. That’s already happening in many places across Europe. But on a deeper level, regarding your fantasy.... Let's say you could land in Munich, be interested in urban tech, and immediately connect with people, events and institutions aligned with that interest—that’s becoming possible too. The data already exists. It’s just scattered. But with open data standards, machine readability, and the right AI tools, we can start connecting those dots. Your fantasy city may not be so far off.

A CEO's Playbook for AI Integration Oct 10 Written By Greg Oates Your competitors are talking about AI. Your board is asking about AI. Your partners want to see your AI strategy. Many DMOs are debating the potential of AI, while an increasing number of others are already extracting real business and organizational value. The difference isn't budget or technical talent. It's knowing exactly where to look for opportunities and how to scale what works. 3 Non-Negotiables You Must Lead This, Not Delegate It: AI transformation dies in committee. The organizations seeing real results have CEOs who champion specific initiatives, remove bureaucratic friction, and signal that AI adoption is a strategic priority. This doesn't mean micromanaging prompts. It means creating air cover for teams to experiment and fail fast. Complex Impresses, Simple Delivers: Your instinct will be to pursue the flashy, sophisticated AI applications that sound impressive in board presentations. Resist it. The organizations generating real ROI start with mundane problems: expense report processing, meeting summarization, competitive monitoring, etc. These boring use cases build organizational confidence and create the foundation for more ambitious projects. Your People Know Where the Problems Are: The best AI applications emerge from the intersection of daily frustration and technological possibility. Run hackathons. Create cross-functional workshops. Ask your teams what they do that feels like waste. The solutions they surface will be more practical and impactful than anything your consultants recommend. Start Here Stop looking for AI opportunities everywhere. Focus your organization's attention on three specific areas where AI creates immediate, measurable value. The Tedium Tax: Every role in your organization includes mind-numbing tasks that consume time without creating value: data entry, compliance documentation, procurement reports, staff vacation tracking, etc. Think of these as your "Anti To-Do List." These are tasks systematically eliminated by asking, "How can I never have to do this again?" Your teams are paying a tedium tax every day. AI is the refund. The Expertise Bottleneck: Projects stall when teams hit the limits of their skills and wait for other departments. Marketing needs data analysis and campaign design mockups. Finance and HR need custom GPTs. Sales needs meetings-related technical specifications translated into customer language. AI breaks these bottlenecks by giving every team superpowers they never had before. The Blank Page Problem: Knowledge work involves ambiguous challenges where the path forward isn't clear: Strategy development, market analysis, problem diagnosis, etc. AI excels at generating multiple approaches, analyzing incomplete information, and proposing next steps when your teams are stuck. It's the thinking partner that's always available and never runs out of ideas. 6 Use Cases OpenAI's analysis of 600+ successful implementations across various industries reveals that virtually every valuable AI application falls into one of six categories. Show your teams these six use cases and they'll start finding opportunities everywhere. Content Creation: Use AI for first drafts of everything: strategy documents, marketing campaigns, product and experience descriptions, customer and community communications. AI maintains your brand voice while eliminating the blank page problem. Research and Synthesis: AI powers information gathering at superhuman speed, including market analysis, competitive intelligence, customer feedback synthesis, regulatory research, etc.. AI doesn't just find information. It structures it exactly how you need it for decision-making. Coding for Everyone: Your non-technical teams can now write Python scripts, SQL queries, and data visualizations. Your engineering teams debug faster and prototype in unfamiliar languages. AI democratizes technical capability while accelerating your experts. Data Analysis Without Degrees: Upload spreadsheets, dashboard screenshots or raw data files and get structured analysis without requiring PhD-level statistics knowledge. This is arguably the most undervalued opportunity that delivers immediate results for most DMOs. Strategic Thinking Partner: AI is a beast for brainstorming, scenario planning, product and event development, asset mapping, risk analysis, etc. AI helps structure complex problems and identifies considerations your teams might miss. This is my favorite use case for AI. Intelligent Automation: Use platforms like n8n, Relay and others to create repeatable processes that run themselves, such as weekly competitive updates, financial reporting, sales and marketing workflows, a ton of admin duties, etc. Create the process once, then let AI handle the execution while humans focus on exceptions and strategy. Implementation is Where DMOs Fail Most AI initiatives fail because organizations treat them like traditional software deployments. They're not. AI is about change management and behavioral transformation up and down the org chart. AI implementation requires different approaches to discovery, prioritization and scaling. Systematic Opportunity Hunting: Don't wait for AI use cases to emerge organically. Run structured discovery sessions where teams audit their workflows for repetitive tasks, skill bottlenecks, and ambiguous challenges. Make this process ongoing, not a one-time exercise. The Impact-Effort Matrix: Not every AI opportunity deserves attention. Prioritize based on business impact versus implementation effort. Quick wins build momentum. High-value, high-effort projects become strategic investments. Everything else gets parked until technology makes it easier. Innovation as Culture: Internal competitions accelerate discovery while building AI literacy across your organization. The goal isn't technical sophistication. It's practical business solutions that teams actually want to use. Measure What Matters: Track time saved, accuracy improved, costs reduced and capability expansion. But also measure qualitative impacts: employee satisfaction, process improvements, competitive advantages. Use this data to guide scaling decisions. Build Your AI Process Move beyond random experimentation to systematic capability building. I like Estée Lauder's 5-phase process to ensure repeatable success with AI. Does this resonate with you for your DMO? Design: Define your purpose, scope and success criteria for AI integration in a 2-page brief. No scope creep. No technical complexity for its own sake. Prepare: Ask department heads to gather relevant data and best practices. AI tools should reflect organizational knowledge, not generic approaches. Build and Test: Hire contractors where necessary to help teams develop automations/agents, implement training, integrate datasets and validate accuracy. Focus on usability, not just functionality. Launch: Deploy with user guides and change management support. Technology deployment is easy. User adoption across all departments is a total headache at first. Optimize: Feedback loops drive continuous improvement based on actual usage patterns. AI applications evolve with business needs and improved capabilities. Key Insight: Always start with fundamental questions: Why build this? What problem does it solve? What impact will it have? Is the measurement for success quantitative or qualitative? Organizations that answer these questions clearly will build more successful AI applications than those focused primarily on technical capability. Build AI-Native Workflows The most sophisticated implementations integrate AI across entire business processes rather than individual tasks. This evolution positions organizations for the agentic AI capabilities coming next. Process Decomposition: Break complex workflows into constituent tasks, identify where each AI use case category adds value, and create integrated approaches spanning from research through execution. Marketing workflows might integrate research for market understanding, analysis for opportunity mapping, ideation for strategy, content creation for product and destination development, and automation for distribution. Cross-Functional Integration: AI facilitates better collaboration by translating between departments. Technical specifications become marketing language. Customer requirements inform sales priorities. Financial models drive strategic planning. Future-Proofing for Agents: Current workflow integration prepares your organization for AI agents that can complete entire projects independently. Teams that understand how to break processes into AI-addressable components will leverage these capabilities immediately when available. The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done. This cognitive shift creates advantages that compound over time and become increasingly difficult for competitors to replicate. "The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done." Key Takeaways The question isn't whether AI will transform our industry. It's whether you'll be leading that transformation or reacting to it. Start with clear, achievable use cases and systemic approaches to build the organizational muscle needed for transformation. AI advantage isn't about having the most technical teams or biggest budgets. It's about developing capabilities for organization-wide discovery, adoption, implementation and scaling of practical business solutions. The organizations moving beyond experimentation to systematic implementation today will be best positioned to leverage the more sophisticated AI capabilities emerging tomorrow. The agents are coming. Will you be ready? Greg Oates

The ROI of AI Agents Aug 21 Written By Greg Oates Based on a bunch of conversations at DI Annual 2025 this month, it's clear that many DMO executives still equate generative AI primarily with writing and editing in ChatGPT. But as one COO of a large U.S. DMO told me, "Surely there's more to all this than just learning about prompting." So many ways to respond to that. Meanwhile, there are also DMO leaders who established AI road maps for their organizations going back two years. For them, they're increasingly focused on developing AI-powered automated workflows and their more sophisticated cousins, AI agents. The purpose of these synthetic workflows is to automate tedious, time-consuming and repetitive tasks to free up staff to focus on more high-value work. Think of it as an evolution from using AI to building AI. You begin by visually mapping what people do in your organization. Then you identify where AI can potentially take over all the mundane stuff better and faster. I’ve been working with my colleagues at Matador Network to develop automated workflows for our Studio team. We have endless terabytes of client video created during the last 10 years. Now, with AI, we want to capitalize on those existing assets to create new video, but first we need to use AI to understand what we actually own. We contracted Erick Bonilla , founder of Pocho.tech based in Uruguay, to build a series of new AI workflows in n8n. One of the automations is designed to cull through 10 years of video files in Dropbox and catalogue everything in Airtable. The AI then creates standardized file names, project IDs, links for raw edited videos and finished client hero/cutdown videos, and location and content tags. The cost to develop the AI workflow was about $2,000 all-in, and it saved more than a month of work at a mid-level manager salary. The beauty of automations/agents is you can measure ROI annually fairly easily, which will help wake up your board if they're sleeping on AI. Moreover, once an automation is in place, the savings will continue to accrue in the future indefinitely for tasks still required, and there’s zero human error. During a staff Zoom, I asked members of our Studio team if they felt these new agents signaled to them the beginning of the end of some people’s jobs. The response was unanimous. Nobody wants to do this type of repetitive grunt work. I spoke with Bonilla for his take on the future of AI agents. Greg Oates: Erick, what services does Pocho.tech provide? Erick Bonilla: We identify opportunities within organizations of all sizes, where we believe implementing AI systems can dramatically improve the efficiency of operations. We can create workflows that process data, or we can create AI agents capable of reasoning, analyzing data, creating reports, and providing decision-makers with an enhanced way of digesting information. I have been doing this for almost two years, working with people mostly in the Middle East, the US and Latin America. The Pocha company site is brand new as I try to expand in the world of AI. GO: What’s the difference between automated workflows and agents? EB: A workflow is like a mass production factory. It's a set of operations that work through specific logic to automate a repetitive process that a human has done before. This could be writing and reading emails, writing summaries, reformatting and transferring content through different tools and applications, etc. An AI agent is a thinking environment that makes decisions for you. You can set a workflow for reading your emails. But then you can have an AI agent that summarizes your emails and tells you, if you have 10 emails, what those 10 emails are about in just one email, SMS text, WhatsApp message, Google doc or whatever. GO: So an AI agent has more autonomy and decision-making capabilities than an automated workflow? EB: Definitely. The AI agent is capable of being completely autonomous to make decisions within a given context. You give it a context with defined restrictions that narrows the scope of the decisions it can make. GO: Can you provide any success stories where you worked with a client who had a specific challenge, and you created an automated workflow or agent that successfully delivered a solution? EB: The most recent example is an EdTech company in Boston that provides a training and placement program for clean energy jobs. They've been operating for the past five years, but there’s been a lack of funds, employees and program applicants to scale beyond Massachusetts. So they decided to use AI and automation to build flows without having to invest a lot of money in hiring people. What I did was streamline the application process for people interested in entering the educational program. We created a form and a workflow that takes the information from the application and puts it into an application tracking system. This system has workflows that can trigger emails, daily reports, weekly reports and invitations to interview. Then I created an AI agent. Once the applicants are interviewed by a human, we take the transcript of that, analyze it using AI, and build a report for the decision maker so they can decide if this person is capable of entering the program or not. We also created a scoring system. We built it based on human criteria, which is subjective, and then we converted that into an objective dataset so we could classify people and score them based on numbers. All of this is done by an AI agent that sets a score for the applicant at the end of the interview. Then we have a leaderboard where people are ranked, and the top 15 get into the education program and placement process. GO: Were they happy with the end result? EB: Oh yeah, very happy. Here's where the beauty and magic come in. Now the CEO can envision a way of expanding outside Massachusetts, and tell her team, "Hey, we're going to New York!" Where before, she thought she needed to hire more people in each new state to oversee the operation. And, because an AI agent works 24/7, she doesn't have to wait until 8am to get a report or transcription, or anything anymore. So now, she can think about how to scale her company more successfully without having to hire more people. GO: What's the road map looking ahead? Where are you going with the company in terms of next steps? EB: We're trying to create an outreach system because the purpose of the company is not only to train people but also to place them in clean tech job positions. The outreach system is going to help the team find more companies with open positions, so the company can place more people in those positions. We’re building a system involving AI agents and workflows where we're going to take a picture of all the open positions and analyze and understand them using AI. We want to know, what are the requirements in terms of learning and knowledge capacity for people to get in these positions, so the company can build a better training program. GO: What was the biggest challenge working with them? EB: I think the most important one, and this is something anyone working on this will experience, is the resistance of some team members who don't trust the performance of AI enough. People who have low experience working with AI, and maybe only know ChatGPT, will look at this and say, "I don't believe this can work." So that means there’s a lot of educational work. People need enough knowledge about what AI tools are capable of to suggest what can and can’t work. I think that's the main challenge. But once people see it working, they start to lean into AI. Suddenly, they become like, "This is great. Can you add this other metric? Can you make it do this other thing too? Can you make me one for my personal side hustle?" It's interesting when you see people moving from resistance to acceptance. GO: Working with you has firmly cemented something I've been preoccupied with this year. It's this: One of the most exciting things about AI, which is giving us more time back during the day, requires the most boring thing, which is having uniform file and data structure. As we've discovered together only too well, AI can't reach its full potential unless you have everything structured super cleanly. The analogy I often use is that AI is like an 8-year-old savant. The person is brilliant but he or she often needs really consistent environments and clear guardrails, or things go sideways or just crash. Can you talk about what any organization needs to focus on when it comes to file and data structure? EB: I think one of the most basic things, and I'm living this with a company I'm helping right now, is documenting files and folders exactly the same. You must set protocols for everything when you’re building a folder system to store content and data. That's one of the biggest challenges for companies trying to implement AI automation with poorly standardized systems. When we didn’t have AI a few years ago, we didn't think of a machine reading our documents or files. We never thought that could be possible, so we never really focused on creating really good file structure. The biggest challenge for companies, coming back to Matador, is how to organize the field of play so that AI doesn't struggle. We easily lose the excitement of implementing AI in an organization when an AI is trying to navigate a maze of poorly organized files. For that, you need to build SOPs that tell everyone on the team, “We're going to be naming files this way now so that a 5-year-old can read the titles and understand what's in every one of them. Because if a 5-year-old can read this set of folders and understand what's inside all of them, then AI can do that too. And if AI can find and read everything, then AI can do some truly amazing things and save companies a lot of money. GO: So how are organizations like ours, which have been in operation for a long time, supposed to go back decades and reorganize all our files? EB: We can run a workflow that can do that for you. That's where the ROI comes in. You can make a one-time investment building a workflow that's going to completely standardize all your filing and foldering. But if you do that, you have to know that the ROI might not show up right away. It's going to start paying off later in terms of the time, money, stress and everything it’s going to give back. A CEO must understand that the return on that investment is going to be ongoing through the years, not in the next quarter necessarily. If you have that mentality, then your company is going to become AI-first. GO: You’ve told me before that AI is not a tool, it's a culture. Can you explain that? EB: Right now, the biggest obstacle for AI expanding in many companies are the CEOs. I understand the challenges because they fear a lot of reputational risk. You have a board and customers that are going to be judging you. If you don't have a very good AI road map, then it could turn into a failure, and the fingers are going to be pointing at you. I understand that completely. But AI should be a culture within companies, and that starts top down because the CEO has to embrace trial and error. AI is going to fail at least during the first time you start with any automation. It's like when you're building a prompt. We were talking the other day, and you said using AI is not about writing the perfect first prompt. It's that fifth or sixth prompt that's going to get you to the right answer. You're going to be iterating with automation, too. That's something CEOs have to transmit throughout the organization. GO: I think for many tourism organizations, we haven’t even begun talking about the big picture value of AI. From an internal perspective, for example, agents offer a whole new level for optimizing operations with AI. EB: Yes, exactly. When we're in a company and we're facing challenges, the first intuitive thinking is, "How can I solve this? I'm going to Google it.” Now we're transitioning to, "How can I solve this? I'm going to ask ChatGPT.” This is great, but that's not AI-first. That's changing one tool for another. You're still browsing. It's literally the same thing. You're not really using AI. AI-first means, "I do this thing that's consuming 10 hours a week. I do the same thing every time. I spend two hours every day doing the same four steps. How can I use AI to automate this?" That's AI-first because you're using AI to stop wasting time. I think that's the culture we should be striving for. If a CEO injects the whole company with that mindset, then the employees are going to eventually use AI to solve their issues more independently and autonomously. At the end of the day, what AI really does is gives us more time and more of our lives back, and we have not yet understood that because it's new. But it's true, AI is the way for humans to have more life. GO: I want that. EB: We all do. GO: I have this belief that eventually, in any organization, all meetings will be recorded and deposited into a central knowledge base where an AI can summarize everything and connect all the key takeaways. I might have a meeting and someone on the other side of the world has a meeting, and the AI will know we're talking about the same thing. It will see and surface how there's potential opportunity to connect our efforts. It's like one plus one equals three, or more. Do you think that's where we're going and that it will benefit companies? EB: Definitely. It's the most common sense thing to do, but I know it's also counterintuitive because there are many people who would not like to have all conversations recorded. The fidelity, the accuracy of the information, and it all being in one place and uniformly structured, is everything. You can have thousands of conversations and tell the AI, "Go here and search for this specific idea in all the transcripts where we have talked about that." You just need to build the SOPs. Then a human can quality control it and say, "This is right. This isn't right. Maybe we can tweak this, or build on that." GO: I’ve experienced this firsthand where people are vehemently against this idea of all company meetings being recorded. For many it portends that clichéd dystopic future we see in science fiction, where everything's controlled and you have no freedom, right? EB: I can see it too. We must remember that these tools can be turned off. If we let the technology control us, then that's on us. I think at the end of the day, it's about how do you balance the risk and rewards? This is something CEOs are used to. Do you prefer to live in blindness and have an uncompetitive company because you decided not to take that risk with automation? Or do you take the risk and have everything recorded, even though some people are going to say it’s Orwellian in a way, and even though ultimately it's going to improve everybody's life? We have to find that balance, and that’s the CEO’s role to determine what’s best overall for the company, customers and employees in the future. GO: Any last thoughts? EB: I think we are not quite there yet to know for sure the amount of ROI that is going to come from agents and automations. Definitely it is going to be positive ROI. For that, I'm completely sure. What I'm not sure is how do we measure ROI based on the anticipated lifetime value of the process? So much is changing so quickly and it's difficult to see the future. As the tools get better, then the workflow gets better too, so the ROI increases, right? Except, we don't really have models for that. For CEOs, I think, they have to try to envision how they can measure the value of automations now, and how that might evolve exponentially in the future. Greg Oates

What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates CEOs at destination marketing and management organizations (DMOs) are seeking AI guidance specifically tailored to their chief executive roles. A CEO in the U.S. told me recently that current AI education is often too surface level, vague, unstructured, or trying to cover too much ground to be useful for a chief executive. He said, "We've been talking for a while now about how we need AI education targeting leadership, but it doesn't really exist." While destination leaders face many more questions about AI than answers, one thing is 100% clear: CEOs must own and lead their organizations' AI integration across all departments. AI isn't something to outsource or delegate to others, and it's not a "marketing thing" for the CMO to figure out. Conor Grennan , chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, consults with clients on AI strategy from JPMorgan to NASA. I asked him how important it is for CEOs to lead AI education, adoption and integration across their organizations. “CEOs have to understand how to use AI and why; they really have to have felt the delight about what AI can do,” he said. "They also have to see clearly how AI is a leadership and change management challenge, not a tech challenge. Then they need to start out being vulnerable, and be able to say, ‘Hey, I was skeptical about AI. I didn’t understand it, either. But now I can explain the way I learned it and how to communicate why it’s important to help other people understand it.” So why do CEOs need to understand AI? Jeff Bezos answered that at The New York Times DealBook Summit last year. He described how “modern AI is a horizontal enabling layer" that will soon be integrated into every device and digital application in existence. "These kind of horizontal layers like electricity and compute and now artificial intelligence, they go everywhere," he said. "I guarantee you there is not a single application that you can think of that is not going to be made better by AI." Here's the clip: Strategic AI Approaches I met with about a dozen CEOs in North America to find out what they want to know about AI specifically from a CEO perspective. Some leaders are seeking big-picture guidance with a broad overview of high-level strategy. "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” one CEO told me. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" Another chief executive said, “We see three areas of opportunity for AI: Administrative tasks and general productivity; marketing chat, SEO and data readiness; and helping customers find information about our city more effectively.… The two most important things I want to know are how to develop AI policy and how is AI changing SEO." A year ago, most CEOs had a wait-and-see attitude about AI, following how the technology evolved and what their cohorts in other organizations were doing. Today, there is a general consensus among CEOs that they need to invest in AI, but the question is how and where. One CEO told me he knows he needs to integrate AI tools and processes into his DMO, but he has three overarching questions that he wants answered first, at least at a high level: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” Other CEOs are seeking clarity on the basic fundamentals of AI: "I need to understand what are the problems that we're trying to solve with AI. What is the purpose of a chatbot, for example? What am I buying, and what can we as an organization accomplish with it?" And then others just want immediate actionable solutions: "I'm not interested in hypotheticals. Show me five ways I can implement AI on Monday. Give me turnkey AI solutions that work today." AI Data is King Personalized data is one of generative AI’s biggest value propositions. Conversational AI (chat) is the new marketplace, and it’s eating the entire funnel including in-destination engagement. In some cities, AI chat conversations between DMOs and visitors is exceeding 25% in-destination, giving DMOs a way to influence visitor behavior in real time. Also, in some industry segments like tours and activities, in-chat conversations are driving in-destination bookings with partners like GetYourGuide. Everyone is looking for first/zero-party data around that. “We have a low level of proprietary data about who is in our destination and what they’re doing,” asserted one CEO. “We have a few disparate data sources, but we need to connect those, and we want to be able to use it predictively. For example, we're looking at regression analysis to help develop future scenario modeling, and we're looking at AI to help us with that." Another CEO said, “We need data that provides material value for our partners. That’s our mandate. How are our visitors spending money and where? How are they behaving and traveling through our area? How can we help people find our partners in a more personalized way?” And one CEO added, "A key priority for us is figuring out the data equation so outbound messaging can be tailored to a 1-on-1 relationship.” Striving for that direct individual customer engagement has been the holy grail for marketers for decades. The ability to deliver mass personalization at scale is now coming into focus with enhanced AI data curation. National organizations like Destination Canada and Germany Travel have invested millions of dollars in data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to restructure their tourism product data from scratch, capitalize on the data more effectively to rank higher in AI search, and drive incremental revenue to partners. That's what the future looks like. For more information, check out the new Canadian Tourism Data Collective and Germany's Open Data Project . Today, local tourism organizations are starting to see how data structure and content architecture are strategic imperatives for them, too. One municipal CEO explained, "I think it might almost be too early to have this conversation in some areas until AI matures more. One thing I am eager to know now is how do we develop a data lake to structure our own data and messaging to make it easier for AI search tools to find." AI search and SEO are a huge conversation today. During the past year, the #1 question I heard while speaking about AI with dozens of North American destination organizations, their boards and key industry/community stakeholders, was: How do we rank higher in AI search? What happens when AI buries organic content? What’s going to happen to our websites? Are they going to disappear? Is a DMO without a website still a DMO? How do we need to produce content differently? And, what the heck is a data lake? One CEO I spoke with is planning on developing a new website for her organization. She said, "I don't even know what I don't know about AI search, but we need to figure some of that out before we start spending any money." Along with data, defining KPIs for AI integration is a hot topic of debate, and presently there isn’t a complete and codified list of metrics that DMO leaders agree on. That said, perhaps the travel and tourism industry collectively needs to understand what AI is, and what it can accomplish at scale, before attaching too many metrics to it. A CMO told me at DI MarCom Summit this month, “People didn’t ask about ROI with the internet when it first came around. We just knew we had to have it,” because it was a new channel for reaching visitors. Same as AI now. Expanding on that, he suggested that DMOs need to break AI success tracking into awareness metrics and performance metrics, and get that conversation right before anything else. Staff AI Adoption Unlike previous technology evolutions, there doesn’t seem to be as much of a generational divide between early adopters of AI and everyone else. The industry can’t look to Gen Z for guidance about how to use AI to the same degree we once asked Millennials for insights about Instagram. Again, driving AI adoption across an organization begins with the CEO. Once that’s established, the real challenge is convincing department leaders and staff to lean into AI. It's a challenge because there is widespread concern, skepticism and/or suspicion among many staff members across many industries that they’re being asked to learn new technologies that will eventually replace them. Leadership should say to employees that no one can force them to use AI, but the job market will. The data is clear. According to the Linkedin/Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index : 79% of leaders agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with Al skills than a more experienced one without 66% of leaders won’t hire someone without AI skills 60% of leaders worry their organization lacks a plan and vision to implement AI And that's a year old. But, understandably, emphasizing those numbers comes across as threatening. A better strategy for driving AI adoption is finding staff members who are already seeing success with AI, supporting them with access to education and pro AI models, and working out from there. The more employees see their colleagues using AI, the more some of them feel inclined to lean in. Therefore, every DMO needs a comprehensive strategic AI road map that includes purpose, policy, education, integration and a continuous feedback loop across all levels of staff. CEOs need to create a space for that. "We're giving our staff time to play around with AI, but they have to present what they're focusing on and what they're learning to their individual supervisor," a CEO told me. Another added, “We're focusing on staff adoption. But I need you to explain to me what works, how to implement, and what should I watch out for." I'm presently working with our departments at Matador Network to explore a bunch of various AI models to optimize workflows, boost creativity, enhance strategic planning, diversify product, etc. There's a well-communicated mandate from the top that Matador will become an AI-first company, and sooner than later. To help accelerate that, we created an AI task force to bring more perspectives from across the company together to integrate AI into operations. That has been valuable with some immediate takeaways, such as staff is now reaching out and asking for assistance with AI. But it's only a start. "There's this idea that if you can get a core group of people using AI then their attitudes and behaviors will spread organically throughout the rest of the company," said Conor Grennan at NYU. "It doesn't work that way. You have to find the people who have fears about AI and listen to them to understand why. You have to say, 'Yes, AI does suck at that, but here's what it's good at.' You also need to weed out the negative people who are against AI outright. They're dangerous." 5 Key Takeaways Let's go back to that first CEO who wants to know the five big questions about AI. Based on the input from the above CEOs, here's a first stab at that: How can I create AI policy that serves our organization but doesn't suppress experimentation among staff? (Interestingly, policy did not come up that much with the CEOs I spoke with.) How do we need to develop our websites, content and data to rank higher in AI search? How is AI SEO different, and the same, as old SEO? What are existing AI chat platforms accomplishing, how are visitors using them, and how are they influencing travel decision making and purchase behavior? If AI is not just for marketing, what does the ecosystem of AI tools for all departments look like across the organization? And what do they do in terms of increasing productivity, creativity and quality? How do I get staff to buy in? We know AI is an imperative for our organization's competitive advantage and relevance. And we know AI is an imperative for employees for their professional growth and marketability. But how do we get our people to really believe in the need to embrace AI? Greg Oates

Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Royce Chwin, president and CEO of Destination Vancouver , personifies how a DMO chief executive needs to establish and articulate the mandate for integrating AI across the organization. That was the topic of our last Destination AI post where 12 CEOs explained: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . Early in 2024, Chwin addressed the full staff in Destination Vancouver’s office before a session I was presenting there on AI. “We cannot not do this,” he said, stating that the organization needed to adopt AI processes to stay relevant in the industry and increase its value in the community. If Destination Vancouver is positioning itself as an innovative DMO, he explained, then the road ahead with AI was clear. Since then, Destination Vancouver launched a new website fully integrated with AI where visitors can customize how they find travel information. The build was a two-year process requiring an inordinate amount of learning to capitalize on generative AI. The team also developed an AI policy guide that Chwin shared for this post. The comprehensive document is designed to "provide clear protocols that maximize and encourage the use of Al tools where appropriate and safe to do so, while minimizing any potential risks and concerns." The policy guide encourages staff to use AI for "enhancing productivity, efficiency, creativity or decision-making." It defines when not to use AI models and how staff is required to review and validate all AI outputs for accuracy and bias. Also, Stefan Hawes, vp of global marketing, initiated the development of an internal AI Council, bringing together a diverse group of staff to coordinate AI processes across the organization. Chwin shared an internal briefing report outlining the purpose of the Council as follows: It is recommended that an AI Council be established immediately to provide a centralized body for managing AI-related initiatives and to expand training opportunities for team members. The Council will focus on: Setting strategic priorities related to AI Selecting use cases, implementing projects/initiatives/AI software purchases and evaluating their effectiveness Developing a data strategy to support AI adoption and initiatives Developing an AI education, literacy and adoption program Ensuring ethical compliance Fostering cross-departmental collaboration to maximize the impact of AI projects We created a similar AI task force at Matador, and the value of that cannot be overstated to better assess how staff from different departments perceive, and misperceive, AI in general. I talked with Chwin this week to better understand how a DMO CEO can best lead strategic AI implementation across his or her organization. The purpose of this post is to help inform, inspire and influence other CEOs to consider the opportunities of AI in a new light. Greg Oates: Royce, you've been a strident proponent of AI for a couple years now, and yet there are many other CEOs who are still reticent. How did you personally come to decide Destination Vancouver needed to embrace AI? Royce Chwin: The perception still of some DMOs is that we are behind when it comes to technology. We're slow to adapt. We're slow to evolve. You see all these other organizations in the travel sphere around us that are able to move much quicker. They might be capitalized better. They can adjust. They can pivot quicker to take on these new technologies, and they can experiment seemingly without the degree of fear or consternation that maybe some DMOs have. So, I think there's lots of different reasons. For us, I mean, it's day and night. We can't not do that. Our entire ecosystem that we play in has some level of AI being used. Number one is our customers. They’re using AI. So it goes back to that same idea that you and I have discussed many times before: How do we as a DMO stay relevant and how do we show value? AI is a response to answering those two things. GO: In many organizations today, there’s often skepticism and suspicion among staff about how AI might take their jobs, or they’re dismissive of AI altogether. How does your team feel about AI overall? RC: I'm not finding a fear in our organization for using AI. I think it's a different set of challenges. I think there are so many derivatives of AI out there that people don't know what to focus on. Because you can’t and don't need to focus on 40 different AI tools. The question is, what are the best tools that are most relevant to the work that I need to do? That, I think, in my experience is a bigger challenge. My sense of it is that AI can be so overwhelming. It can seem unbelievably complicated. So we had to ask ourselves, do we have the time, resources and skill sets to simply understand it? Secondly, are we asking better questions to understand what in the organization we need to solve, and can AI help? GO: In a previous post, I shared input from 12 DMO CEOs about how they feel about AI. What are you hearing from other CEOs? RC: I was over in Europe recently for Destinations International’s Global Leaders Forum where I was onstage with Sherrif Karamat (CEO of PCMA) and Petra Stušek (CEO at Ljubljana Tourism). We were talking about the importance of face-to-face meetings and so on, and Sherrif made a comment that DMOs are really behind using AI. It was kind of a blanket statement, and he's not wrong. But, I said to Sheriff that I think a lot of DMOs are behind because it's like throwing confetti in somebody's face and asking them to pick the best pieces. They don't even know what they're trying to evaluate, and it’s also moving so fast. In the meantime, our customers are running around us using AI for all kinds of things. And so I think that there's not so much a fear of using AI. It’s more that people are questioning how to respond to the increasing emergence of AI because they’re thinking, “I'm not really 100% clear on the business problem I'm trying to solve that supports my mandate.” For us, and you saw it when you visited, we were really clear on what it is that we needed to do. We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI. “We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI.” GO: I’ve been asserting that CEOs should own and lead AI adoption in their organizations to have the best chance for success. I don't mean lead it day to day. I mean the chief executive must establish the mandate that AI is something the organization is going to invest in, and articulate why and how to the entire staff. Connor Grennan, chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, emphasized to me that’s the only way this works. Do you agree? RC: Yes, I absolutely believe it must come from the CEO because the CEO has to clear the vision with the team. And with something as seismic as AI, and how it’s evolving in our daily life, in our world, I think the CEO has a responsibility to address it and how it will impact the organization. Everyone needs to understand how we’re going to use AI in alignment with our mission and strategic goals, and how it will support the mandate. That's all CEO level. That's the responsibility on my head. Also, I can't imagine going in front of my Board and asking, “Hey, what are you doing with AI? What should we do with AI?” So it has to come from the CEO, but my Board has also enabled me. Like, there's no grief from my Board. Zero. We are fully enabled. GO: You've created the necessary structure to help govern AI integration with your AI Policy and AI Council. Can you expand on the thinking behind those? RC: We developed an AI policy that’s designed to enable people to use AI and not discourage them from experimenting. Obviously, some education is required in terms of proprietary information and those kinds of things. But we're really leaning into this and we're going to assign some time for it to enable the organization to experiment and play with AI without fear of reprisal. Naturally there needs to be governance around it, but governance does not mean stopping creativity. Governance means we’re creating and delivering new opportunities for creativity. There just needs to be structure around that. Also, Stefan came up with the idea of pulling together an AI Council in the organization, which I think is fantastic. We're getting individuals from each business line, including myself, and we’re going to talk about AI, its impacts, what we need to be thinking about, and how we'll improve our website and the organization as a whole. So we're creating dialogue around it to define opportunities. For example, I'm really excited about AI as it relates to all the country market analysis that we do. We've been doing that by spreadsheet, but now we’re exploring AI to provide the insights we need to inform our market planning more effectively. There are lots of different examples like that, but you only discover them by being open to experimenting with AI. Greg Oates

Toronto & Denver Tourism Leaders on the 5 Big AI Questions for CEOs Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates A year from now, the travel and tourism sector might look back and thank Andrew Weir, president and CEO of Destination Toronto , for catalyzing how DMOs move forward with AI. At PCMA Convening Leaders in January this year, I asked Weir what CEOs need to understand about AI at a high level. Numerous other CEOs have told me there’s a complete lack of AI education specifically designed for DMO chief executives. His answer was first shared anonymously in our previous post, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” said Weir. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" At the end of that post I suggested what those five questions might be based on all the CEO insights in there, and I've since been shopping them around to vet them. A few weeks ago, for example, Richard Scharf, president and CEO at Visit Denver , suggested restructuring the questions to create a more logical hierarchy. Now, the first three deal with internal operations while the last two identify external, visitor-facing priorities. Yesterday, I spoke again with Weir, as well as Paula Port, vice president of marketing at Destination Toronto, for their input on the five questions. The goal here is to provide clear structure around AI platforms and processes for DMOs leading up to Matador Network’s collaboration with U.S. Travel at ESTO in Phoenix this fall. Together, we’ll be co-hosting an interactive, multi-station “AI Playground” educational activation during the three days of the conference. Here are the five big AI questions. These will evolve but now we have a foundation to begin building consensus on how DMOs can capitalize on opportunities and navigate challenges with AI today. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The 5 Big AI Questions 1. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? A growing number of DMO leaders say their teams embrace AI for the most part, and many are actively developing basic AI strategy. That’s a significant shift from a year ago. At the same time, there's still varying degrees of cynicism and skepticism about AI in other organizations. I asked Weir about his staff. “I don't feel like we're dragging the team into this,” he said. “It's really more a matter of how people are at such different places with AI. So our goal is figuring out how to channel all their knowledge and energy, and kind of align and unify that, without stifling anyone’s creativity.” Scharf at Visit Denver emphasized that this question should be the first one, because successful AI integration begins with understanding your staff’s grasp of AI and their appetite for leaning into it. “ChatGPT is growing like Zoom did a few years ago so we know we need to use it,” he said. “The first thing we did was survey staff to assess how they feel about AI, and how or if they’re using it. Then we started off with small bites like email. Now we think of AI as a toolkit, and we're continuing to explore what tools are appropriate for different needs.” Port added that AI integration across teams works best with both structured and self-directed learning. “We started by making everything (ChatGPT Plus, Google Gemini) available to everyone, so they were given access to tools and resources, but a lot of this is really self-directed learning,” she said. “What we're seeing now is people have taken advantage of that and moved forward with it. Some maybe a little bit further than others, so maybe we need to address that. I think we still need more use cases and more structured learning because we're not all at the same level in terms of knowing and understanding how to put AI to use.” 2. How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? Destination Toronto was one of the first North American municipal DMOs to develop an AI policy. They began the process by pulling examples from larger government-operated tourism organizations including Destination Canada and Destination British Columbia. “We set up that policy structure first in terms of what we wanted as an organization, and also being very clear that any use of AI was meant to drive business results,” said Weir. “I think we were able to get there pretty quickly because we didn't create a series of regulations. We built a series of philosophies and principles to guide where we go. It was meant to put guardrails around protecting information, while at the same time, stimulate learning and sharing. Because we said to the team that you are free and encouraged to use AI, but there is an expectation that you will share what you've learned.” Port explained further that, “We leveraged existing processes already in place from a content perspective in terms of bias, IT usage, etc. We have an assessment process for any sort of software application that we're looking to use, so we did the same with AI.” (Note: The next GuideGeek Destination AI post will be with Kara Franker, president and CEO of Visit Florida Keys, who is also an attorney. We discussed AI policy at length.) 3. How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? Scharf stated that integrating AI platforms and processes beyond marketing is “where all the work is happening now.” His organization is switching out regular stand up meetings with extended AI workshops and visiting speakers to learn more about AI tools for various use cases across departments. Leadership, he said, including himself, are present at these meetings so everyone is learning together. Weir and Port both addressed this question, saying they need to first explore how Simpleview, Cvent and other tech partners are integrating AI functionality before looking at any new AI platforms. We discussed PCMA’s Project Spark , an AI-native event development tool that includes the new Destinaitor destination sourcing platform. DMO leadership and sales teams are exploring Spark to understand how clients are using new AI software to evaluate, compare and source destinations for business events. Others, like Kara Franker mentioned above, are looking for new AI solutions to optimize their HR and accounting departments, but she said many of the available options presently are only enterprise grade. Something DMOs should really look at, and I’m not sure how/if many already are, but there is proven value in creating custom GPTs for sales teams. GPTs are like mini ChatGPTs designed for specific purposes that anyone with a ChatGPT Plus account can create. For example, a sales rep can build a knowledge base inside a GPT by uploading sales materials, examples of successful bids, product information, pricing, team members, case studies, testimonials and other data. The next step is to develop internal GPT instructions to direct what the GPT does and what it prioritizes. Following that, the rep can then chat with the GPT and ask it to create a customized bid for a potential client that pulls all relevant source materials from the knowledge base that best supports the pitch. I’m imagining the ability to create custom GPTs is going to soon be a standard and required capability for all sales teams. One of the earliest enterprise examples of this was Salesforce’s Einstein GPT, which has since morphed into Agentforce. We use them at Matador because of improved efficiency and quality. GPTs also provide a new option for creative brainstorming, which some salespeople appreciate who don't identify as being super creative. Increases in sales production can be clearly identified. However, there's increasing conversation about tracking success in other departments. When AI delivers clear improvements in efficiency and saves people significant time, how do you measure that? One concern is that people will then just work a six hour day versus eight hours. The common thinking is that organizations will need to adjust productivity benchmarks, but this is a messy conversation. I don’t know enough to comment on that yet, but I wanted to put a pin in it because it’s something we’ll all need to look at eventually as AI scales in the workforce. 4. How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? I was addressing Visit Denver’s Board a while back and one member suggested that DMOs won’t need websites soon because they’ll be replaced by a ChatGPT-like window. I’m surprised by how much this comes up. For one thing, DMOs will always need some kind of online knowledge base for AI search queries. If anything, that will require more content and more comprehensive product information because AI search thrives more than anything on data structure, clarity and specificity. That said, the web user interface will likely evolve considerably. Expect to hear a lot more about how DMOs are developing data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to optimize data structure for AI search. For further context, here's a Perplexity Pro response to the question: "Are tourism boards developing data lakes and warehouses to optimize their sites for AI search?" Weir suggested that this conversation about the future of websites is not unlike what we went through 15 years ago, when people were lamenting the death of DMO sites because social media was deemed by some as the new web. More important, he asserted, is seeing how AI search is evolving and being prepared to adapt strategy. “I think there is a push-pull here between how we lead and where customers are at,” said Weir. “We want to deliver more information through our AI assistant and AI search in general, but customers aren't really there yet. I don't know what the percentage is, but the majority of people are still using Google. They're still beginning an interaction on the web by entering search terms in Google the traditional way. At some point, that's going to flip, right? It's going to be a few percent more each month or quarter, whatever that is. But how far ahead of it do we get? And how do we calibrate? We can try to lead on this, but you know, we also have to stay in step with where our customers are too.” 5. How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? Chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI have dashboards that clearly identify what visitors are asking about in the destination. That helps inform content and product development strategy, and the data is valuable for community engagement. AI chat platforms also operate 24/7 in 50+ languages, which helps DMO influence in-destination travel and spending for a much wider audience than ever before. How to best capitalize on conversational AI, and ultimately conversational commerce, is an evolving topic because we’re still in the early days where travelers are learning they can search with large language models and trust them. ChatGPT has 400 million weekly users but ChatGPT only added full functioning search capability for all users a few months ago. Consumers are just beginning to understand that they can now “talk” to a city. To help accelerate understanding and adoption of AI chat among visitors, Port asserted that the onus is on DMOs to promote their AI chat robustly like any other channel. Weir did that recently by highlighting Destination Toronto’s GuideGeek-powered “6ix” chat platform on LinkedIn, asking, “Ever had a chat directly with a city?” Weir was specifically promoting the organization’s WhatsApp platform, where people can now have a highly personalized, iterative conversation directly with Destination Toronto via the GuideGeek AI integration. The same functionality exists with the other Meta platforms, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. A few hours after Weir's post I received a Slack message from our CTO Stefan Klopp wondering what was going on in Toronto. WhatsApp volume was spiking, he said, and he was asking if Toronto had sent out a press release promoting 6ix, or something. No, it was just a quick CEO social media post. Also, Tourism New Zealand just launched a new campaign in collaboration with “A Minecraft Movie” that integrates GuideGeek-powered prompt questions to trigger further engagement. So, those are just a couple examples of how DMO/NTOs can drive AI chat engagement. The question for Weir and Port though is about the types of questions people are asking in AI chat platforms. Presently, a lot of the chat conversations are more utilitarian, related to queries about hotels, restaurants, attractions, events, directions, etc. So as conversational AI adoption increases, will DMOs focus more on developing content that answers those basic types of questions, like what hotel, restaurant or attraction is highly rated, and how to get there. Or, should DMOs continue to focus mainly on developing what is generally perceived as more inspirational destination and experiential content? "The question then becomes about responding to inquiries versus the inspirational side," explained Port. "Like, all of these articles, all of this content that we serve up, that is not in response to a question per se. It's more packaged to inspire people. I think a lot of that's going to have to exist outside our environments, maybe, whether it's influencers, it's your earned media strategy, it's content partnerships, things like that. That's where I think the inspiration will exist. But we really have to move to being more of the informative one, on our website or whatever a website is. But it needs to be very specific in answering questions. We already see that on GuideGeek." Weir summed up, saying, "I think this ends up relating more to, again, that question of where the customers are. Are we putting ourselves in a position to answer their questions and deliver the information in the way they're looking for it, using AI and the data lake approach? Or, are we curators like we've always been, inspiring visitors with local experiences, or is the customer now the curator by virtue of how they're asking questions today?" Summary These five takeaways are aligned with the five big AI questions. AI adoption begins with talking to DMO staff to understand what the organization is working with. Love the idea about marrying structured and self-directed learning, and being intentional about that with staff. At some point, for AI adoption to scale and continually evolve on an ongoing basis, there needs to be AI leaders in any organization who pick up the torch and inspire their colleagues to lean into AI. Otherwise, things tend to plateau with the same people using the same AI models. AI policy is intended to encourage staff to innovate with AI as much as it's meant to protect organizations. AI is the death of "I don't know," so it can benefit all staff in all departments. That in itself is enough ROI to validate initial investments in AI. The tools can provide a foundation of knowledge and direction for problem solving and strategic planning exponentially better than traditional search. Some organizations, like Visit Greece who we work with, have phenomenal website data structure ideally optimized for AI search. Meanwhile, one CEO told me "Our website is a mess with outdated content and poor data structure. We need to rebuild from scratch with AI search top of mind." Chat is the new marketplace, and AI is eating the entire funnel including in-destination. Moreover, AI chat data provides DMO leaders with insights into what visitors are asking about. Although, I think as chat adoption scales mainstream, the conversations will evolve beyond asking for a good hotel or restaurant. Greg Oates

Why Small Steps With AI Create Big Wins for Tourism Organizations Sep 22 Written By Greg Oates Key Theme: How to Align Strategic Risk Management and Progressive AI Implementation The rush to transform everything with AI has dominated boardroom discussions since ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Yet the most successful organizations aren't pursuing wholesale AI overhauls. They're taking calculated, incremental steps that deliver real value while building capabilities for the future. MIT researchers interviewed senior managers at 21 large companies actively using generative AI. Their findings challenge the prevailing narrative about AI transformation. Companies are deliberately choosing "small t" transformations over risky, large-scale implementations. This approach works particularly well for tourism organizations where customer trust and regulatory compliance matter deeply. Tourism organizations face unique challenges with AI adoption. Customer data privacy concerns run high. Regulatory requirements vary across jurisdictions. Service quality directly impacts reputation. The research reveals that successful companies treat AI implementation like climbing a risk slope. They start with low-risk internal applications before moving to customer-facing solutions. This measured approach isn't about being timid. It's about being smart. Tourism CEOs can build organizational confidence, develop necessary skills, and demonstrate tangible value before tackling more complex implementations. Start With Universal Productivity Tools That Employees Already Want to Use The research uncovered a surprising reality. Employees were already using ChatGPT and other public AI tools without permission. Companies responded by providing secure, private versions of these tools. This grassroots adoption pattern offers tourism organizations a clear starting point. Consider how your marketing team writes destination descriptions. Your operations staff creates training materials. Your finance team prepares reports. These tasks consume hours of employee time across every department. Private AI instances from providers like ChatGPT or Claude eliminate security concerns while boosting productivity. McKinsey built a custom platform called Lilli that connects AI to 40 internal knowledge sources. The result? Seventy-five percent employee adoption in under a year. Time savings up to 30%. Substantially improved work quality. Tourism organizations don't need to build something this sophisticated initially. Even basic AI writing assistants can transform daily work. Microsoft Copilot integration takes this further. Employees can search across company documents instantly. They can pull content from emails, meeting transcripts, and presentations. One manager described it as having "a super search engine" for company information. Imagine your team finding that obscure policy document from three years ago in seconds rather than hours. The beauty of starting here? Minimal risk. Maximum adoption. Employees want these tools. They're probably already using consumer versions. Providing enterprise versions addresses security concerns while meeting existing demand. Your IT team maintains control. Your employees get productivity gains. Everyone wins. Some employees will still seek external tools for specific needs. One product manager uses Midjourney for quick visuals. Another uses voice-to-text tools for performance reviews. Accept this reality. Focus on providing core tools internally while establishing clear guidelines for external tool usage. Deploy AI for Specific Roles While Keeping Humans in Control Once basic AI tools gain traction, tourism organizations can target specific job functions. The key insight from the research? Maintain human oversight for quality control. This "human in the loop" approach reduces risk while capturing efficiency gains. Customer service represents an ideal starting point for tourism organizations. AI can help agents find information quickly. It can suggest responses in real time. It can analyze call patterns to identify coaching opportunities. MIT researchers found AI coaching tools increased call center productivity by 14% on average. New and low-skilled workers improved by 34%. Morgan Stanley equipped financial advisors with an AI assistant trained on over one million internal documents. The tool doesn't replace advisors. It helps them find information faster so they can focus on customer relationships. Tourism organizations can apply this same principle. Help your concierge staff access local recommendations instantly. Enable tour guides to answer obscure historical questions accurately. Support reservation agents with instant access to availability across properties. CarMax demonstrates another powerful application. The company uses AI to generate descriptions for over 5,000 car pages. Manual creation would take multiple humans 11 years. With AI, it takes hours. The 80% approval rate from editorial review proves quality doesn't suffer. Tourism organizations can apply this to property descriptions, tour summaries, and destination guides. Creative teams at Dentsu use AI throughout their workflow. From proposals to budgeting to ideation. The emerging technology director noted employees spend less time on mundane tasks. They create higher-quality content with less effort. Tourism marketing teams can similarly accelerate campaign development, social media content creation, and promotional material design. Finance departments traditionally resist new technology. Yet some organizations successfully use AI for audit reports, regulatory compliance, and fraud detection. Amazon's finance team reports employees shifted from repetitive tasks to critical thinking work. Tourism organizations can start with expense report processing or invoice matching before tackling complex financial analysis. Transform Customer Experiences Gradually With Clear Boundaries Customer-facing AI sits highest on the risk slope. Yet the potential rewards justify careful exploration. The research shows companies succeeding by setting clear boundaries and expanding gradually. Chatbots evolved from frustrating phone trees to sophisticated conversational agents. John Hancock's insurance chatbots handle common queries effectively. Human agents focus on complex issues. Starbucks, Domino's, and CVS expanded to voice interactions. Video interactions come next. Tourism organizations can start with FAQ chatbots on their websites. Add booking assistance once that works well. Expand to voice-based concierge services when ready. Personalization transforms online shopping experiences. Tapestry, parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, uses real-time language modifications. The conversational tone mimics in-store associates. Revenue increased at least 3%. Tourism organizations can personalize trip recommendations based on past bookings. Adjust website content for different traveler segments. Customize email campaigns for individual preferences. Software companies already embed AI throughout their products. Adobe users create and modify images effortlessly. Canva simplifies presentation creation. Lucidchart converts text descriptions into flowcharts. Tourism organizations benefit as their existing software vendors add AI features. Property management systems will suggest optimal pricing. Booking platforms will predict cancellation risks. Marketing tools will automate campaign optimization. The key? Start small. Test thoroughly. Expand gradually. A failed internal productivity tool frustrates employees. A failed customer-facing AI damages your brand. Move up the risk slope deliberately. Build Foundational Capabilities Before Attempting Major Transformations The research revealed an uncomfortable truth. Scaling AI from pilot to production is harder than expected. Data quality issues multiply. Edge cases appear more frequently. Integration challenges compound. Many organizations discovered they needed stronger foundations before pursuing ambitious AI projects. CarMax's chief information officer emphasized data quality. "Good data will give you good results from AI." Poor data produces unreliable outputs. Tourism organizations must audit their data systems. Customer records across multiple systems need reconciliation. Historical booking data requires cleaning. Property information needs standardization. Governance structures matter equally. Who approves AI projects? How do you measure success? What happens when AI makes mistakes? Establish these frameworks before scaling implementations. Small pilots can proceed without perfect governance. Enterprise deployments cannot. Capital One's chief scientist warned against the "gold-rush mentality." Thoughtful, responsible implementation beats rushed deployment. Build the scaffolding to bring everyone along. Tourism organizations should resist pressure to match competitors' AI announcements. Focus on sustainable progress over headlines. Management buy-in proves essential for larger projects. One technology company's AI efforts stagnated until the CEO personally championed them. Small wins build credibility for bigger investments. Document productivity gains from initial deployments. Share customer satisfaction improvements. Make the business case concrete before requesting major funding. Summary: Small Transformations Today Enable Big Transformations Tomorrow The research delivers a clear message for tourism CEOs. Successful AI implementation doesn't require revolutionary change. It requires evolutionary progress. Start with universal productivity tools that employees already want. Target specific roles with human oversight. Transform customer experiences within careful boundaries. Build foundational capabilities systematically. This approach particularly suits tourism organizations. Your business depends on human connections. Technology should enhance these connections, not replace them. Your customers value authentic experiences. AI should enable better experiences, not artificial ones. Your reputation takes years to build and moments to destroy. Measured AI deployment protects what you've built while enabling future growth. The companies studied aren't waiting for perfect AI solutions. They're using today's technology to solve real problems while preparing for tomorrow's possibilities. They're training employees, cleaning data, and establishing governance. When breakthrough AI capabilities arrive, they'll be ready to capitalize quickly. Tourism organizations can follow this same path. Deploy AI writing assistants next month. Add customer service chatbots next quarter. Enhance personalization next year. Each step builds on the last. Each success enables the next. Small transformations compound into competitive advantage. The AI transformation race isn't won by the fastest starter. It's won by consistent, strategic progress. Tourism CEOs who embrace "small t" transformation today position their organizations for "big T" transformation tomorrow. The journey starts with a single step up the risk slope. Greg Oates

How to Develop AI Strategy for Your Organization Oct 12 Written By Greg Oates The 2050 City AI Roadmap provides a high-level strategic framework for how DMOs and other organizations can capitalize on AI to optimize internal operations, resources and knowledge, and ultimately, drive partner revenue. DMOs have all kinds of strategic plans, master plans, business and marketing plans, etc. The 2050 City AI Roadmap outlines the process to develop your AI strategic plan. It defines the big picture outlook for AI as the future of commerce, and it proposes a methodology to help DMO leaders prioritize, organize and navigate how they go about integrating AI across their organization. Presently, we're rolling this out with Visit Mesa , Tourism Richmond in British Columbia, and The Florida Keys & Key West . The three CEOs for those organizations have all agreed to share takeaways and business outcomes with each others' teams to cross-pollinate learning and accelerate AI process integration. That spirit of knowledge sharing and co-learning for me is huge, because we as an industry are all pretty much flying blindly with AI from a macro perspective. Yes, we've come a long way in the last year. Every DMO CEO I talk to these days is now implementing various AI processes and seeing value. However, we're all kind of flying this plane while we're building it at the same time, and we don't really have a destination, or even due north, in mind. The 2050 City AI Roadmap was designed to identify where we're going with this emergent technology that's both incredibly powerful and often highly unpredictable. It also defines how high-end AI chat platforms, like Matador Network's GuideGeek AI , are the tip of the spear for agentic commerce. The following guidelines are based on experience in the workplace to deliver new value with AI for your team, board, industry partners and community stakeholders. Internal & External Direction Every decision related to AI strategy should first be defined through an internal or external lens. Your board members will typically view internal workplace optimization as tactical. Externally, AI integrations that are consumer-facing and revenue generating are usually perceived as more strategic. Internal Facing From an internal standpoint, the focus of the AI Roadmap is on optimizing operations to take advantage of an organization's aggregate of resources and knowledge. Imagine the totality of insights across every team member in terms of their expertise and networks in their communities. AI systems are designed to pool and capitalize on that, but only if an organization's knowledge base is structured intelligently. That means rebuilding your folder structures and files naming conventions so an AI can find everything. According to Slack, workers spend 41% of their time on menial tasks, including endless hours just looking for information. The overall losses related to productivity, quality of work and workplace, and physical/mental health are crazy. So let's start there with AI strategy to address our internal digital dumpster fire. External Facing Externally, from a marketing, sales and visitor/partner engagement perspective, AI strategy begins with integrating a robust AI chat platform like GuideGeek. DMOs have never really had proprietary information on who their visitors are. They have geo-location, credit card spend, event attendance data, etc., which show visitor behavior. But none of those really identify visitor motivations and mindsets indepth. With an AI chat platform, DMOs can now pull analytics showing what visitors are actually asking and what they want to know on an individual and aggregate basis. We launched our new GuideGeek V2 analytics dashboard this past week, which provides deeper, fuller insights into visitor psychographics. That data then informs all kinds of resource allocation decisions related to content development, AI SEO strategy, data analysis, product and destination development, community engagement, etc. CEO Roles AI is best defined as a new digital "co-intelligence" that can communicate, reason and create for the first time ever, versus just another new technology. We emphasize that AI is really a new environment for collaboration more than anything, just not solely among humans anymore. Learning AI is not like learning Photoshop. You can only "teach" AI up to a point, like trying to teach someone how to ride a bike. You can't teach a child how to stay on two wheels without falling in a classroom. He or she actually has to start pedaling, and eventually the child's mind and body basically have a conversation, so to speak, with the bike to grasp the fundamentals of moving forward successfully. Same with AI. The only way to learn AI is to use AI. Helping human teams embrace this new co-intelligence (and it's not like there's a choice) falls under the umbrella of change management. That's a CEO's wheelhouse. It will take more than a few years for many humans to reconcile their minds and values with this new relationship, and it falls on the CEO's shoulders to steward that reconciliation. Likewise, CEOs oversee AI governance, policy and privacy. I've shared before how AI governance should be viewed less like a car brake and more like a steering wheel to inform, direct and accelerate AI adoption and integration. Lastly, only CEOs can scale long-term AI benefits and business outcomes effectively. You can't really delegate this. AI efforts will plateau at times, some or many AI experimentations will fail, and there are always staff members who will drag their feet because they just don't like AI. DMO CEOs are chief people officers and it's on them to create the right culture for scaling AI platforms and processes effectively for everyone in their crews. Agentic AI This is where things get interesting. AI agents and agentic commerce might sound super confusing for many or most staff members. Lots of land mines to watch out for, sure, but even more reasons for us building a macro DMO AI strategic framework. One of the key objectives for the AI Roadmap is to elevate AI agents and agentic commerce as the two interrelated cornerstones for AI strategy, and explain why. Doing so shows the true big picture value of AI, and it drives home how we eventually need to move way beyond training people the basics of prompting. Yes, it's intimidating, but we introduce the labels and contexts relating to agentic AI early on in the process. That gets some people thinking bigger about AI, and it entices the AI champions in the group to start experimenting with agents. AI Agents (Internal) For internal AI strategy, leading DMOs are developing AI agents and automated workflows to address the aforementioned 41% of time that staff members spend on grunt work and trying to find information. They are proven, they work, and most of all, they deliver measurable ROI. We're working with outside contractors at Matador to develop and implement agents and automations for both ourselves internally and for DMO clients. We are already seeing success, and there's been a recent influx among our people asking for agents. It's an amazing thing to see when staff members start requesting new AI integrations like that, proactively. That's when you know your AI strategy is working at least on some level. Agentic Commerce (External) AI agents are also the foundation for agentic commerce. According to Mastercard , "Agentic commerce is a new form of online and mobile shopping, in which an AI agent 'closes the loop' or completes tasks for a user — such as searching for items, comparing options and making a purchase — with limited or no manual inputs needed from that user. For example, while chatting in a generative AI app, you could tell the AI agent, 'Book me a nonstop flight to London for under $600 next week — no red-eyes,' and the agent will review airlines, nearby airports and your loyalty memberships and payment card rewards to identify the best option, purchase it and then share it with you." Just like with AI agents, developing agentic commerce architecture covers a wide spectrum of sophistication and capabilities. Going back to the analogy of flying a plane while building it with no clear final destination in mind, agentic commerce is the point on the map where we want to land. With GuideGeek, we have Kayak, GetYourGuide, Skyscanner and other booking tools integrated into the platform with a click-through UX/UI. Looking ahead, we're working with one national tourism organization to bring some of their national partners' booking engines (air, hotel, tour op, etc.,) into the platform to eventually convert sales in-chat. Subscribe to Mastercard Signals to keep up-to-date on agentic commerce and access intelligence like this Mastercard Payments Trends Navigator report. Staff Training & AI Integration Training staff and implementing AI processes across all departments is really the meat of the 2050 City Roadmap. But none of that should proceed without DMO leadership embracing all the above, and communicating it clearly to all staff. Easier said than done, though. Leadership needs to continually communicate a high-level approach to AI strategy, because it won't really click for many staff (or leadership) at the beginning of this process. That, of course, needs to be married with all the practical training initiatives we're continuing to develop. We've already learned a ton with the present work we're doing training DMO teams. Here are a few very basic takeaways just to start explaining our process. There are obviously many more educational modules following these, ranging from predictive analytics to specific department AI training in areas like HR, finance and legal. Conduct an internal AI survey asking all staff to share their perceptions and usage of AI. Follow that up with small group interviews across the organization, and transcribe everything with an AI notetaker. We use Granola, but there are many others. Also, explain to staff that all meetings regarding AI will be recorded to create an internal knowledge base to identify opportunities, challenges and takeaways over time. Start training with a focus on just the paid/pro models of ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. Some staff feel confused with the sheer variety of available AI tools in front of them. We explain that, at the end of the day, the basics of using AI include an end user, an AI tool, and a knowledge base. Get people on board with that, and then show how most of the AI tools they have access to are similar in many ways. One of the fastest methods to advance AI understanding is showing staff how to create custom GPTs in ChatGPT. Some team members will pick up on these quickly and start integrating them into their workflows right away. These are the people who typically make up your internal AI taskforce. Explain and show how Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot are AI workhorses that connect with the majority of people's daily workflows. However, humans tend to think of those as just the next evolution of search engines. This is mental wiring that needs to be broken. Gemini and Copilot are great/good in some ways, but I've found that training staff on just those three native LLMs first (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) is more effective for seeing the light. Google NotebookLM has a lot of fans. I like to walk teams through it because it's a good way to reinforce what a knowledge base is, like we do with the custom GPTs. Also, the automated audio and video podcasts are crowd pleasers, especially with the new Join function where users can engage directly with the agentic podcast hosts. People don't seem to want to read anymore. This was a rude awakening for us when we first launched the AI Roadmap with a series of online training materials. We now know we need to deliver short video instruction if we want anyone to actually look at the educational content. People love Descript for AI-powered video creation. Once we started showing how to use Descript, we were pleasantly surprised to see how staff really leaned in. Teaching Descript provides a fun break early in the process because people can see pretty amazing results in minutes and wrap their minds around the process fairly easily. Ask all staff to share how they're using AI effectively and where they see AI failing them. Catalogue the case studies and share across the organization to accelerate learning, inspire a healthy sense of internal competition, and track learning over time. Staff members are also often wowed seeing AI agents in action. We use n8n to develop agents, where you can create a lot of basic automated workflows quickly. Once a few early adopters see how agents can take over some of their more tedious, time-consuming tasks, others will jump in. Feedback Loop & Funding/Board Support This line in the AI Roadmap is broken down into tactical internal optimization and more strategic, consumer-facing and revenue-generating sales, marketing and stakeholder engagement. I don't have a lot to share for this section and the following one because our focus to date has been mostly on the above phases. Feedback Loop The reason we record every engagement with AI Roadmap clients is to scale learning, so if one person learns something, everyone can benefit. That will be further multiplied when we starting sharing takeaways across DMOS, and eventually the industry as a whole. Visit Mesa, Tourism Richmond and Visit Florida Keys are eager to lead this initiative, and we plan to launch a new AI thought leadership framework collectively in 2026. Funding & Board Support The spark that led to developing the AI Roadmap happened almost a year ago when a board member for a large DMO told me that she viewed AI integration as merely a tactic. If this work can elevate AI in the minds of board members toward a more high-level strategic imperative, then we'll have achieved part of our mission. There's still some work to be done first though to collect more case studies showing direct AI business outcomes before we can make a more solid case for additional funding for AI integrations. AI Strategic Plan We've produced a mockup of what we think an AI Strategic Plan will eventually look like, but it's too early to show presently. For now, we've identified three overarching pillars, each with potential strategies, action items, timelines and targets. The KPIs are crucial, of course, for scaling AI strategy across the travel industry. Right now, we're thinking the three pillars might look like the following, although this is all up in the air right now: Optimize Internal Operations & Knowledge: The strategies include cleaning up internal folders/files to improve AI outcomes in general and develop AI agents specifically. A lot in here on training, experimentation, overall adoption, success measures, etc. Increase Partner Revenue with Agentic AI: Defining how DMOs develop AI agents to fuel agentic commerce is the big goal overall with the AI Roadmap. Initial strategies in this pillar begin with more low hanging fruit though, such as website redevelopment, optimizing for AI SEO, AI chat integration, etc. Expand Community Collaboration: We're seeing more DMOs take a leading role in AI education for their industry and community stakeholders. The 2050 City Roadmap is perfectly suited for informing how DMO leaders can facilitate community AI workshops and increase the organization's overall relevance and value. Greg Oates

Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Kara Franker , president and CEO of The Florida Keys & Key West tourism organization, was among the first DMO leaders to embrace AI platforms and processes in 2023 when she was chief executive at Visit Estes Park in Colorado. In May 2024, Franker published two papers on AI strategy and policy: From the Base of the Rocky Mountains to the World: A case study through Visit Estes Park’s journey into Generative AI solutions — and how your DMO can carve its own AI path Navigating AI and the Law in the Travel Industry: An Introduction to Legal Implications for DMOs The first paper highlights how Visit Estes Park integrated GuideGeek AI chat into their website and three Meta platforms: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The DMO also branded the chat Rocky Mountain Roamer to give it an identity and bit of personality. The second paper focused on AI policy and data privacy, security and compliance. Franker, who is an attorney, co-wrote that with Roxanne Steinhoff , also an attorney at Steinhoff Law, who leads the firm’s destination marketing and sports tourism practice. I caught up with Franker to see how her perspectives on AI strategy and policy are evolving almost a year later. Greg Oates: You've been leading AI strategy in tourism for almost two years beginning with your work at Visit Estes Park. However, there’s still a lack of AI training today specific for DMO CEOs, and many leaders are presently unsure how to proceed with AI. As a CEO, what’s your take on that? Kara Franker: I'm not surprised that there's a lack of training because there's just so much for everybody to wrap their heads around. I think some people are trying to watch and wait and see. My philosophy has been more of a fall-forward, fail-forward kind of approach. That's why I put the white papers out. Anybody could learn from what we had done, and do it better. You know, a case study is sometimes the best way to figure this stuff out, so that's why we did it. The second paper on AI policy was with Roxanne Steinhoff on the legal and ethical implications of AI. Because when I would go and speak in front of groups, those were always the big questions from the leadership. They don't know how far is too far once you open this can of worms. That's why we got together and started to put guardrails in place that we thought might make sense for people to study, just as a first stab at it. That all launched last summer, so I do think that there's a little bit of education out there but we could definitely use more. GO: What do DMOs need to know about AI policy at a very high level in terms of privacy and security? KF: Employee and client information should be kept private and not uploaded into any AI tools. That could be a big deal, thinking of all the different rules and regulations about collecting information, especially how it's more stringent in Europe than in the United States. That can cause potential problems if you're uploading, say, a client list that has personal cell phones, email addresses or other information that people just don't want out there. So, it's really more about information that's attached to a person. And then, is there competitive data that you don't necessarily want others to have? Possibly, but so much of what we do in the DMO space is public anyways so the lines for that are pretty blurry. I’m trying to imagine a scenario where a DMO is, like, basically hacking somebody else's information through AI. I can’t imagine that’s worth the time and effort, or even possible. GO: A few months ago we were discussing what AI tools might be available for DMO departments like HR and accounting to help with privacy, compliance, efficiency, etc. But everything available seems to be enterprise grade and out of reach for DMOs. So what’s the answer for scaling AI across an organization? KF: I think this is a huge need. I hired somebody from Cisco who’s my new VP of technology and partnerships. She's a total AI nerd like I am, and way more qualified to dive into all this. She and I have been looking at different options to put together, almost like little plugins. We really, really need this. For example, how do we take an AI solution from the legal world to analyze all our contracts so that we don't have to spend as many hours with attorneys, because we really just need a template, right? And then for HR, same thing. How do we organize all our employee files into a much more streamlined and effective system? And then there’s our policies. We're a nonprofit but everything we do is so heavily influenced by County government. We have so many compliance issues, so I want an AI to learn every single piece of County policies so we’re able to compare and contrast what we're doing with those policies. I haven't been able to find anything to help with these things. We've looked at a lot of different options but it's like what you're saying. They're these big enterprise pieces built for law firms or financial people, and they’re all really expensive. None of them fit the mold for improving different operations at a DMO. In my mind, the marketing side is covered, especially with GuideGeek, and there are so many great options now for everything involved with marketing. So I feel like that's been tackled and done really well. But for the operations, we need more. I mean, we’ve just got to keep digging deeper, I think. GO: When you and your technology person from Cisco figure all this out, will you share what you find with the rest of us? KF: Of course, always. GO: Backing up a bit, you were arguably the very first DMO CEO to lean into AI, at least in North America, when you were with Visit Estes Park. How did you convince your board that investing in AI was important at the time, and what were some of your processes with bringing along staff? KF: We were fortunate in the sense that the board was all in and the staff were all in. And I don't mean to make age a part of it, but the staff was a little on the young side and they were all very ambitious. Everybody wanted to try to figure it out. So we made the argument to the board, if we could figure out some of what AI could do, it would make the community stronger and they could take pieces of it back to their businesses. There wasn't really anybody who was against experimenting and trying it out. We made some mistakes along the way and we put that in the white paper. Also, when we first rolled out GuideGeek, which scrapes the website, we found a few holes in our content. There were particular board members who didn't have very robust information about their business, so they got a little bit mad, but not in a, like, burn it down way. It was more of, "Oh, okay, we have some work to do." So part of the AI process has to actually be community outreach. It can't just be about the technology. We have to talk to all our partners and get really robust information from them, so when the AI crawls the site it gets the best possible information about our partners. GO: One thing you did at Visit Estes Park was brand your GuideGeek AI as Rocky Mountain Roamer on your website and three Meta platforms. We use that as a case study a lot, and emphasize that a DMO should promote their AI just like any other channel, right? KF: Definitely. We knew we had to put money behind marketing the tool if we wanted people to interact with it. Traditionally with a DMO, one of your calls to action is to send people to the website. Our new call to action for a lot of our campaigns back then was to send people to the AI, so we called it Rocky Mountain Roamer to help promote and drive traffic to it. And then in terms of KPIs, we wanted to track all the interactions you can see in the backend, but not just how many people used it. We wanted to know how long people interacted with the AI, what their journey was, and what they were asking about because that’s where things get really interesting. GO: After the initial thrill of launching GuideGeek, how did you manage how staff used AI internally? Were there any incentives involved to help spur adoption and experimentation? KF: The incentive for my team was, well, it wasn't really an incentive. It was a requirement. They had to write weekly reports for me about how they tested something with AI, whatever it was. It could apply to their job or not, I didn't really care. So I almost forced them to try AI. But then people started really getting into it. They were getting more and more user friendly with different AI tools, and they would be like, “Oh, I like Anthropic because of this or that,” because they were branching out from just using ChatGPT. So, yeah, there has to be almost like a culture of AI in your DMO for it to really work, and it's on the CEO to create and foster that. Greg Oates

Join Matador Network's AI Playground at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Matador Network, GuideGeek AI and U.S. Travel are launching the inaugural "AI Playground" at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix, August 17-19. The educational space, hands-on demo area, genius bar and live sessions will run all three days during the conference. We are also producing programming specific for travel industry CEOs, along with other sessions dedicated for senior executives, highlighting actionable AI strategies focusing on real world business outcomes. Leading up to ESTO, I'll be reaching out to many of you requesting any AI-related success stories and/or questions you might have for the AI Playground. Looking back over the last two years, it's clear the industry is turning a corner in 2025 when it comes to AI learning and adoption. Many DMOs and their industry partners are now integrating AI processes and platforms across their organizations, whereas last year many destination leaders were still in wait-and-see mode. For those of you still on the fringes, it is our ambition that the AI Playground will plant a flag in the ground showing how AI is now a proven strategy for helping DMOs further deliver on their mandate. "AI is clearly powering the future of travel and how people explore the world today," says Ross Borden, founder and CEO of Matador Network. "We are stoked to be working with U.S. Travel and investing in our industry to produce the AI Playground. AI will become standard operating procedure for every DMO soon, and we're excited to help lead this journey." DMO CEOs on AI Strategy Matador launched its proprietary GuideGeek AI chat platform for DMO websites and social media channels almost two years ago. We now have more than 40 DMOs onboard, and we're expanding the scope of GuideGeek AI with new hotel groups and tour operators joing in recent months. Based on our experience working with municipal, regional and national organizations across the global visitor industry, we have unparalleled insights into how conversational AI is changing the relationship between destinations and visitors, as well as how DMOs operate internally. In preparation for ESTO 2025, we launched this GuideGeek Destination AI newsletter in January to ramp up our industry outreach and further expand our understanding of how DMO leaders are navigating the rise of AI. Here are five stories from the newsletter that inform high-level decision making related to AI strategy, with input from more than 15 CEO DMOs: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI : Our first post with 12 DMO CEOs highlighted the wide range of questions they have. One asked for the five big AI questions he should know about. Another wants practical advice on five AI initiatives that he can implement, like, tomorrow. Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism : CEO Royce Chwin, who helms Destination Vancouver, shared why his organization was one of the first DMOs in the world to dive into AI. Destination Toronto & Visit Denver CEOs on the 5 Big AI Questions in Tourism : Two chief executives, Andrew Weir in Toronto and Richard Scharf in Denver, worked out what they believe are the five big AI themes/questions that DMOs need to focus on, as touched on in the first post. Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation : Newly installed Florida Keys CEO Kara Franker, who is also an attorney, shed light on AI policy, compliance and the need for more non-enterprise AI solutions for her organization. Visit Mesa CEO Launches New DMO AI Road Map : Another visionary DMO chief executive, Visit Mesa leader Marc Garcia is bringing a new level of structure and direction for integrating AI processes and platforms. Next up, Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau, will be discussing AI strategy from a business events perspective. I also met with Cody Chomiak, vice president of marketing at Travel Manitoba, who's really lighting a fire in Canada around AI thought leadership and adoption. He'll be sharing a few powerful AI case studies from his provincial marketing organization, both internal and visitor-facing. AI Playground at ESTO 2025 The AI Playground this year will feature three stations at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge . We will have our Matador GuideGeek team and U.S. Travel staff on hand to guide participants through the space, along with some invited AI experts from around the industry. We'll be digging into a handful of paid AI models including ChatGPT Plus/Teams, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro, Google AI Pro, Microsoft Copilot Pro and Manus. We'll show how AI is best navigated at DMOs by bucketing strategy into three unique categories: Search, Create and Sales. Specific use cases will include content generation and data analysis, AI SEO and AI-optimized web development, AI policy and governance, staff adoption, building custom GPTs for sales proposals, and automated workflows and AI agents, among others. The three stations are: The Prompt Lab welcomes all attendees to come in and test drive various AI models. The interactive, hands-on learning station will have multiple laptops for experimenting with AI tools for people of all skill levels. We'll have a bunch of paid AI models pre-loaded for live demos and one-on-one conversations showing how AI actually works and some of what it accomplishes across different departments. Feel free to bring your own laptop if you like. The Genius Bar is designed for individual and group Q&A about real world AI strategy, implementation and ROI. We'll be collecting all the questions posed to share with the broader industry afterward, so we'll have a couple crowdsourcing boards to help generate new ideas and explore new solutions. Reach out to me if you want to schedule time to talk during ESTO. The AI Theater seating area will host a range of AI-focused dialogues, micro-presentations and a few dedicated sessions designed for CEOs, as well as other senior executives. The programming schedule for all those will engagements be included in the ESTO agenda. Most importantly, all the conversations at the AI Playground will highlight tangible AI case studies and specific business outcomes. The 5 Big Questions About AI One of the best things to come out of all the interviews with DMO CEOs this year is our list of the five big AI questions that chief executives need to focus on. These questions will likely evolve a bit, but for now they're providing direction for how we're developing the AI Playground and how DMOs are moving forward with AI integration. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? I would love to hear your feedback on any the above and how we can make the ESTO 2025 AI Playground as valuable as possible for you and your teams. Reach out at greg@matadornetwork.com . Greg Oates

Visit Mesa CEO Launches New AI Roadmap Aug 25 Written By Greg Oates Visit Mesa in Arizona kicked off a new internal initiative this week to integrate AI processes and platforms across the organization. I worked with Visit Mesa to help develop their new DMO AI Roadmap, which provides a 5-phase strategic framework that most any visitor organization can use as a template. The project officially began this week during Visit Mesa’s spring board meeting to communicate why the organization is moving forward with AI to optimize the DMO’s value for Mesa’s visitor industry and the local community. Marc Garcia, CATP , president and CEO of Visit Mesa, has been eager to start this initiative. He was one of the dozen CEOs who contributed to the first GuideGeek Destination AI story a few months back, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI. For that deep dive into a CEO's mindset regarding AI, Garcia asked: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” The Visit Mesa DMO AI Roadmap answers those questions. “I've recognized that AI is extremely important not only for the world moving forward, but specifically for our industry,” Garcia explained at the beginning of this project. “We at Visit Mesa need to get out in front of it. Even as a small to medium-sized DMO with our budget, we've always taken pride in the fact that we’re typically at the forefront of the latest and greatest in terms of technology, and so this is just an extension of that.” The following is a high-level overview of the DMO AI Roadmap and each of the five phases. However, like all strategic planning, there is a big jump between developing a plan and executing it effectively. This is especially true with internal AI training. In any given organization today, there is often a wide breadth of how people perceive AI and how proficient they are with AI models. It will take time to educate and align everyone around shared benefits for the organizations and staff, expected processes, intended outcomes and success metrics. Visit Mesa AI Roadmap The DMO AI Roadmap is a structured, phased approach for educating staff and integrating AI across DMO departments. The goals for the roadmap are to optimize internal operations, enhance sales and marketing outcomes, inspire staff self-learning, future-proof the organization, and contribute to how well local industry and community leaders adopt AI best practices and benefit from them. There are two imperatives that should be established and agreed upon among leadership at the very beginning. Integrating AI processes and platforms is an imperative for the DMO to ensure its relevancy and long-term impact in the local visitor economy. If leadership doesn’t fully believe that, this strategic framework won’t work. AI proficiency is an imperative for staff members for their future growth and marketability. That said, you can’t really force people to embrace, learn and use AI intentionally, but the job market will. The following phases are highly fluid and some of the processes can be rolled out concurrently. Ultimately, these phases provide structure for effectively and responsibly implementing a new technology that has no precedent. Because of generative AI, machines can now do three things they haven’t been able to do before. They have the ability to reason, the ability to communicate, and the ability to generate stuff based on that reasoning and communication. Meaning, AI is messy. Integrating it into our daily workflows is also messy because it's challenging us to rethink our relationship with technology. But as Kate Yordi, director of marketing at Visit Mesa, said during the board meeting this week, “Finally, we have some direction.” Phase 1: Leadership Alignment & Staff Communication As discussed at length in previous Destination AI posts, the DMO CEO must make it clear to all staff that the organization prioritizes AI because the organization prioritizes being relevant. It certainly helps, as is the case with Visit Mesa, when the CEO is fully backed by the board to invest in AI integration. During the board meeting, one member asked, “What do you need from us, Marc?” That’s a good sign. For the DMO AI Roadmap to work, all leadership needs to not only have a basic understanding of AI tools, they need to actually use them as well on a regular basis. That goes a long way in driving agency across the organization. However, making that happen typically requires some C-suite training to explain the primary AI models more indepth: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot and/or Google Gemini depending on the specific workplace platform(s) the organization uses. Identifying and prioritizing just a handful of AI models like that brings a lot of clarity to the process right off the bat. You see people's shoulders relax when they're confronted with 5-6 AIs versus dozens. (Yes, VEED, Gamma, Manus, Sora, Granola, Slack AI, etc., are all really cool but let's not start there.) A common lament among DMO leadership related to AI is, “Where do we even start?” Leadership should then discuss and begin to answer the five big questions all CEOs face when navigating AI integration, as vetted in the aforementioned Destination AI post about what CEOs want regarding AI education: How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI (who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI) to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and quality of work? How do we redevelop our content and channels to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI for business purposes to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The next step in this phase, at a basic level, is communicating to staff why they’re being asked to embrace AI. The following is not meant to be comprehensive, but a CEO would likely want to articulate: The purpose of the AI Roadmap, guiding principles, and the phases and processes involved How AI integration will take time and people will evolve at different paces It’s ok if everyone feels like they’re building the plane while flying it Everyone is encouraged to use AI and will be supported, but there will also be guardrails in place AI adoption and use cases will become part of employee reviews, but traditional roles, responsibilities and key success metrics are still the priority "How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents." — Marc Garcia, president and CEO, Visit Mesa Phase 2: Staff Assessment & AI Task Force Sitting down and asking staff how they feel about AI and how/if they’re using it is a good way to begin. Depending on the size of the organization, this can be done with every staff member individually or a representative group from each department. Generally people fall into three camps when it comes to AI: 1) Those who are already using AI on a regular basis; 2) those who are curious and have experimented a bit, but they don’t actively engage with AI tools; and 3) those who don’t see much value in AI. This last group can also include people who outright oppose AI, but they make themselves apparent pretty quickly. Data also shows there is often a significant percentage of staff who use AI in secret because they’re not sure they’re allowed to use it for work purposes. The second way to collect staff sentiment and AI capacity is with a blind online survey asking everyone what they like about AI, what concerns them, how they feel about job security, what they want to learn, what they hope to achieve, etc. Everything is anonymous so you can expect a wide variety of feedback ranging from constructive/optimistic to fears of an impending robot apocalypse. Once complete, all the data should be synthesized into key takeaways for leadership and shared with staff to show a high level of transparency right from the beginning of this process. The second part of this phase is developing an AI task force. The value of this cannot be overemphasized. Choose a small group of AI champions from various departments to do three things: Provide direction for stewarding the various processes in each phase as effectively as possible from beginning to end Share constructive and thoughtful input they’re hearing from other staff members about how things are proceeding well and where there are challenges Help scale AI adoption across teams by showing how they’re using AI effectively to everyone else in the organization An internal AI task force or council is invaluable because the members are motivated and they want to learn. Mostly, their enthusiasm and success with AI will begin to rub off on many of their colleagues and inspire self-learning and greater adoption among the teams. But not all. There will be those who disengage, and there can be a significant number of them. Over time, they should be consulted to understand their trepidation, which should then be addressed. This is a challenge I'm having with one organization where a significant cohort are saying they're too busy to learn AI. Meanwhile, the majority of the staff are reporting daily usage with effective results, which definitely wasn't the case a few months ago. And even with those leaning in, the level of improvement and AI Iearning will be slow at times. This is why it’s critical for the CEO and the rest of management to be all-in and consistently participate in staff training sessions to show direction, intention and support. It’s very easy for the novelty of AI training to wear off after the first few months. This is where the AI task force can be instrumental to help maintain overall staff interest and keep engagement levels as high as possible. "Finally, we have some direction." — Kate Yordi, director of marketing, Visit Mesa Phase 3: AI Policy & Investments Developing an official AI policy and governance manual accomplishes two primary objectives: It protects the organization against legal and financial liability by establishing how all employees are required to use AI responsibly. It encourages and gives license for staff to proactively experiment with AI because there are clear guidelines in place about how to do so. There are many DMOs who have created AI policies and are willing to share with the rest of the industry. These are typically not lengthy documents (3-4 pages) nor full of legalese. Generally they’re written so every single employee can understand everything in them. Sections in these policies often include: Positioning/Purpose Statement: Expresses how and why the organization needs to be intentional about implementing AI processes Primary Objectives and Intended Outcomes: Defines the business case for how the organization is attempting to deliver on its core mandate of driving revenue to local businesses in alignment with community priorities Guiding Principles: Establishes the principles of responsible AI use in alignment with the values of the organizations related to themes such as inclusivity, bias, authenticity, veracity, collaboration, knowledge sharing, etc. AI Definitions: Provides clear explanations of AI terminology used in the document and workplace AI Tools: Identifies specific AI models that the organization provides access to Data Input: Dictates clear rules about what employees can upload into AI models and what they can’t upload, such as personal information of any person Monitoring: Defines how the organization reserves the right to monitor AI practices Training & Support: Defines opportunities for professional growth and learning AI on an ongoing basis There are other items that DMOs might include in the above list, and they vary depending on how HR, financial and legal departments interpret AI governance, but it serves as a foundation. One key consideration for DMO leadership when it comes to policy is identifying which pro AI models to invest in. Paid AI tools provide higher levels of privacy and security because AI companies don’t train on them, or at least there’s the choice to select that option. Many DMOs, for example, purchase annual subscriptions for paid ChatGPT Team accounts ($25 per employee monthly) for staff to use for work, which is a first step for protecting the IP and other interests of the organization. Other paid AI models are then provided to specific departments based on need and the specific attributes of the tools, such as Claude for marketing and social media staff because many consider it the best AI for content creation. Phase 4: AI Education & Implementation This is the most important thing in training teams to embrace and use AI effectively. You want to foster an environment where structured learning evolves into self-learning. That’s the only way this scales. When staff members with little experience in AI start exploring how to use AI on their own, and they start helping their colleagues see new ways to use AI, that’s a pretty special thing. From an education standpoint, the DMO AI Roadmap begins at a high level defining AI’s place in online history. AI is the third transformational shift since the PC was invented, including: The mainstream web/internet in the 1990s; the evolution of mobile/social/cloud and apps in the 2000s; and gen AI in the 2020s. These are the only three times when big tech went all-in and pivoted their business models around a new technology. I then break AI training into the following buckets, and again, this is all very surface level and not meant to be comprehensive. Also, creating engaging demos are everything, and that's not also easy because AI demos can be a real slog sometimes. But, showing how different AIs provide real value is key for people to internalize their learning and use it more intuitively over time: Explain how pre-gen AI tech is deterministic and gen AI is probabilistic, which messes with a lot of people’s minds. Gen AI outputs are based on statistical patterns and probabilities, just like the human brain processes ideas and information. Traditional tech is based on absolutes, delivering the same output based on the same input. Old tech is about information. AI is about knowledge. Spend a lot of time on this with workshops and demos. Highlight the capabilities of only three AI models to start: ChatGPT for brainstorming and planning; Claude for writing and data analysis; and Perplexity for conversational search. The other two, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, are more general purpose. They also do amazing things (Gemini 2.5 Pro is great for reasoning), but focusing on the first three will provide direction at the beginning so people don’t get overwhelmed. At the very minimum, leadership should have a basic understanding of those three. Explain how AI search isn't 100% perfect but it's a 1,000% better than old search. Define how DMOs and all brnads are redesigning their websites and content strategy to optimize for AI search, and the basics of AI SEO . I would argue the most important thing for using AI is really understanding how generative AI = conversational AI. It's a dialogue. It's called "chat" for a reason. This is where I’ve heard the most positive feedback from teams I’ve worked with. It happens when people move beyond the Google mindset—where search is one and done—and they see the real value of iterative conversations with AI models that evolve with each exchange in the discussion, just like a human conversation. This also removes some misperceptions about how to prompt. Yes, there are some basic rules about how to prompt well. But beyond that, it’s vastly more beneficial to explore AI conversations further with thoughtful follow-up prompts that flow logically and organically to achieve the best results. Explore how the real value of AI extends beyond just efficiency and productivity gains. That's a dangerous dialogue with staff who can construe that as leading to more work or being terminated over time. The bigger value and better narrative is how AI increases creativity and knowledge, and how those both influence overall quality of work, marketing effectiveness, sales productivity, staff culture and pride, job satisfaction and growth opportunities, etc. Really dig into the advanced features of the paid models: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro. Aside from the added security and privacy they provide, they offer functions not available in the free models and their outputs are significantly better. ChatGPT Projects and custom GPTs, Claude Projects and Perplexity Spaces are where the magic happens. Create an environment where staff members are eager to share their successes with AI with the rest of the organization. This feedback loop is critical for steering education and driving adoption, and it’s one of the most important roles for the internal AI task force. AI-training meetings can be highly effective during video calls but they often have the greatest impact during in-person workshops. Also, make sure to give staff a specific amount of hours during the week to develop their AI skills. Explore options for AI chat platforms and the benefits they provide for visitors and local industry partners. I work with Matador Network, which developed the industry leading GuideGeek AI chat platform. The feedback from 35+ DMO clients is impressive and irrefutable, but there is still much work to do educating visitors and industry about AI chat strategy and their benefits to continually increase adoption and business outcomes. The DMO AI Roadmap also provides guidance for developing various learning and engagement formats: Schedule weekly or bi-weekly meetings specifically, and only, for AI training with both internal and external people sharing insights Create a library of AI educational materials for staff to reference Start a weekly internal AI newsletter to share how teams are using AI Start a Slack or similar channel dedicated for AI education, AI news updates, knowledge sharing, etc Start a weekly and optional one-hour AMA meeting for everyone to ask everyone else questions (highly effective) Create a regular schedule for staff to report back to leadership or department heads about how they’re using AI and what they’re achieving with it Phase 5: Success Tracking I kick off every AI presentation identifying the three AI models mentioned above—ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity—followed by the assertion that, "AI is the death of 'I don't know.'" That is arguably the biggest ROI for integrating AI in a DMO or any other type of organization. There are few questions that are too complex or too intimidating for DMO staff to approach with confidence and conviction if they know how to use those three AI models effectively. I shared an example previously where I used Perplexity Pro to educate myself about how board governance is evolving . That for me was something I knew was out of my realm of expertise, but now I feel I can speak with some semblance of authority about that to any board because of AI. Before gen AI, I dismissed board governance as one of those things I'd just have to leave in the dark. That said, trying to explain how AI helps staff become more self-reliant, where they can always build a foundation of understanding for anything to empower themselves, only goes so far with a board. They're looking for more quantitative KPIs. Here are just some examples of that in a DMO context. In 2025, defining KPIs for AI integration is an evolving science, and we as an industry are still figuring a lot of this out. Therefore, this list is nowhere near comprehensive and it will evolve, but we have ample data today to validate the following: Using AI for search and content development saves significant time and increases opportunities for higher output and increased creativity for producing blog posts, social media, videos, marketing campaigns, etc. Developing custom GPTs (in ChatGPT Plus) for group sales is a proven strategy for creating better, more customized proposals in much less time. That gives sales staff more time for brainstorming and prospecting leading to higher production. That's a fact. In this case, group sales people are actually pumped to try a new technology. Using AI for regression analysis and scenario modeling increases the accuracy of how DMOs predict visitor volumes year-round, event attendance, economic impact, etc. One of the biggest conversations in DMOs today is how to develop content and websites to rank higher in AI search. Developing best practices in AI SEO leads to higher traffic. That is a core mandate for any DMO, and no DMO can afford to ignore that over time. AI chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI are driving real business. As described in PhocusWire in March, New York City Tourism + Conventions launched its GuideGeek-powered "Ellis" meeting-specific AI chat in January. ROI to date: 100% increase in traffic to the meeting planner website, 800+ AI-driven queries in the first month, 50% growth in newsletter sign-ups, and 10% increase in time spent on the site. Summary The AI train has left the station and it's gaining steam. The DMO AI Roadmap is the next logical step for helping DMO CEOs and their teams integrate AI processes and platforms. As Visit Mesa's Kate Yordi said, "Finally, we now have direction." That's a big deal for DMO staff to feel that way. Generative AI has been with us for more than two years now, but a structured and phased approach for integrating AI across DMO departments has been the missing piece. Visit Mesa's DMO AI Roadmap is going to evolve as the team works through the process, but at least now there's a vision and scope. Visit Mesa CEO Marc Garcia and the board are fully committed—a critical first step for embarking on this journey. Also, this strategic framework for how DMOs approach AI is going to underpin the interactive AI Playground activation at U.S. Travel's upcoming ESTO conference in Phoenix, August 17-19. U.S. Travel and GuideGeek are partnering to develop educational programming for the hands-on AI training experience and series of thought leadership. Greg Oates

How AI Improves DMO and Community Master Planning Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Many DMOs are developing 10-year destination master plans to optimize their visitor economy in alignment with local community priorities. I've participated in producing dozens of them from Miami to Mesa. They often take as long as a year to complete because there's so much focus on community engagement in various formats: interviews, focus groups, town halls, surveys, visioning sessions, etc. The tourism industry talks about the importance of community a LOT. However, when you're working with a DMO, you never really dig into what actually moves the needle across so many endless community demands, not on a tactical and hyperlocal level. You're not really held accountable for any measure of success when it comes to community-specific initiatives, ranging from improving City Hall permitting processes for small businesses to tracking the movement of unhoused. A master plan needs to address those and amplify those kinds of pressing needs for the destination overall. The expectation is not really to fix them. That’s not the role of a DMO. It's a whole different ballgame when you're developing a long-term strategic framework for a community organization like Near Southside, Inc . in Fort Worth. Success and being accountable for fixing things is expected. Located at the periphery of the downtown core, Near Southside is the most interesting community in North America right now. The ex-industrial district can be loosely compared to Austin 20 years ago with the same cultural DNA and similar community values, based on a fiercely protective love for local, creative and independently owned small businesses. That's under threat. In the last few years, as Near Southside evolved into the coolest 'hood east and west of the Pecos Line, real estate prices are rising commensurately. We all know how this story often ends with the encroachment of national brands sanitizing the soul of a place that made it attractive in the first place. Near Southside is intent on rewriting that story. AI Processes for Strategic Planning Here's where AI comes in. Because of the multitude of overlapping challenges and evolving dynamics in the community, our team needs to crunch and debate a ton of qualitative and quantitative data. Addressing gentrification touches on so many aspects of how communities operate. Therefore, we are over-indexing on community engagement to get as many perspectives as possible to identify how the community best evolves in the face of rapid change. The amount of inputs we're getting is substantive, and we want to inventory all of it as thoroughly as possible to build a super comprehensive knowledge base for the AI to cull through, connect dots and output insights. Every individual zoom call with stakeholders is recorded with Granola AI, which produces full transcripts but the summaries are too light. So we created custom GPTs with instructions for everything we want in the summaries, including comprehensive overviews, key takeaways with detailed context for each, the most insightful quotes related to those takeaways, and all action items that stakeholders recommended. With the GPT, we can fire full transcripts into the chat, press "enter" and receive highly valuable, high quality and uniform summaries almost immediately. We're doing the same with the focus groups but the custom GPTs require a different set of instructions. The two-hour transcripts capture the conversations with 10-20 stakeholders convened across specific industry and community segments. For those, the GPTs bucket corresponding high-level takeaways and tactical action items related to the same theme. That has immeasurable value because these conversations are all over the place. It's great working with locals who are so passionate about where they live and how, but that means you're getting feedback from a firehose and someone taking notes doesn’t capture all the nuance. Using custom GPTs to produce these summaries and populate takeaways is as good or better than any team could do manually. Everything is stored in Airtable. Forget Google or Microsoft cloud platforms. Airtable is an AI-powered, relational database/spreadsheet beast for organizing data and automating basic workflows. The tables combine all project information in one place, such as a running list of pending/completed interviews and focus groups and their AI-generated summaries. Airtable can then auto-generate a summary of the summary in the same table for clients to easily review everything being collected on a daily basis to whatever degree they prefer. Once you use Airtable, you'll never look at Google Drive the same way again. I've never had so many insights so well organized, so thorough and so easy to share with a team and client to help inform each project phase. The client loves the transparency, immediacy and structure, naturally, versus waiting for the next weekly update to read a few bullet points in a PowerPoint. Here's the thing. Because we've been so intentional about collecting such a high quality and comprehensive volume of feedback, we have a motherlode of a knowledge base for AI to work with. We can then enter all that in bulk into Google NotebookLM or ChatGPT/Claude Projects to pull out anything from high-level aggregate takeaways to anything super customized or tactical. For example, the client was interested in hearing specifically just what developers had to say about gentrification. I wanted highlights related to anything discussed regarding City Hall processes. It’s super easy to pull reports together for those and anything else. Ultimately, you can use AI to deliver an outline, a strategy map and a very rough draft of a destination master plan. All you need to do is combine all of the above together, plus PDFs of all relevant public and private planning documents, PDFs of all relevant case studies and best practices, and detailed instructions about the purpose, elements, structure, etc., of the plan. People will disagree, sure. I'm not dismissing the expertise of people who put these things together, because they bring deep context to every conversation and decision made during the development of a master plan. Everything happening now in Near Southside has happened somewhere else. When you can bring takeaways from those places to any present situation, it helps provide direction for everyone in the room. Again, I’m not saying that AI is replacing humans. People get all kinds of worked up over that, especially in travel and tourism. I am saying you can create a better, more strategic and more informed master plan in a much more streamlined fashion when you employ AI strategically to better prepare a community for the future. That's just a fact. I have four more community focus groups today in Near Southside. The expectation among everyone is that their contributions will make a demonstrable difference in their neighborhood. We can’t just speak to the challenges. We need to fix them and our processes with AI are giving everyone more confidence that we can deliver on that. Wondering how many DMOs are interested in employing similar AI-first strategies to get a better handle on how to help their communities. Greg Oates

How Visit Richmond is Using AI to Sell More Conventions Aug 2 Written By Greg Oates DMO CEOs want specific use cases for AI showing how they drive measurable business results. Here's a great example for capitalizing on AI to drive meetings and conventions volume from Lauran Peoples , director of sales marketing and business development at Visit Richmond in Virginia. Peoples works in the organization's 13-person sales team and reports to the VP of sales. Her role has three core functions: She is the main liaison between the destination sales and marketing departments; she develops and leads campaign strategy for the sales department; and she works with her colleagues to optimize strategic partnerships. Peoples' role is somewhat unique as a liaison between sales and marketing in that she lives on the sales side, versus marketing. She also stands out in our industry as an emerging voice in AI innovation. If you're going to U.S. Travel's ESTO conference this month in Phoenix, look for her and me working in the show's inaugural AI Playground educational activation. Greg Oates: Can you explain your role at Visit Richmond, specifically in terms of how you bridge the sales and marketing teams? Lauran Peoples: It's becoming more common in DMOs for sales teams to have a marketing liaison, but usually that person is based on the marketing team and is mostly assigned to sales to help with creative. The issue is when that marketing liaison is based on the marketing team, they don't have much exposure to the field and what's happening out of market with your salespeople. Our sales team has 45 trade shows this upcoming fiscal year, so they're traveling almost every week. With my situation in Richmond, they're getting real-time data and downloads about what's happening in each destination, so that gives them more authentic conversations to engage planners. Not having someone assigned to a team like that creates a huge disconnect and leaves opportunity on the table. GO: Tell us a little about your journey with AI. LP: I've been working in hospitality for 20 years. Last year, I heard some younger people on the team talking about ChatGPT. So I was like, okay, I don't know anything about that. I went to PCMA Convening Leaders in January and the opening session was all about AI. I remember sitting there feeling like a dinosaur. Feeling very behind. I realized this is a lot more serious and widespread than I thought, so I left and tasked myself with using ChatGPT once a day. Initially, I couldn't differentiate how it wasn't like Google. I was asking it how many tablespoons are in this or that, kind of thing. Since then, my understanding of AI has progressively increased around more complex and comprehensive capabilities. It has streamlined my productivity, but more importantly, AI has become a thought partner for me to bounce all these ideas and scenarios around that I didn't have before. I think that a lot of people are adopting AI and using it as a communications assistant, or a writing assistant. But the part for me that's really exciting and valuable with AI is analyzing and aggregating data and getting it to show you things that you need help with, like sales. GO: Can you share an example? LP: Sure. I took five datasets: five years of lost business, five years of definite business, and three marketing reports from different campaigns we were running with outside agencies like Sojourn and Digital Edge. Those campaigns give us demographic insights because we were targeting certain areas. I also grabbed our sales deployment sheet, which tells you who has what market. I uploaded all of those into ChatGPT and asked it to identify the top five locations for each of our managers based on their market segments. Some results weren't surprising, but there were a few that popped up like Orlando that we've never traditionally considered. When I asked ChatGPT why Orlando, it showed how the city has a large hobby market. It turns out there are a lot of hobby conventions that meet in Orlando. After I compiled the top five locations for each manager, I asked ChatGPT to give me the top five accounts in each of those locations. Then I asked for unique selling propositions for each of those accounts as to why Richmond would be a perfect fit. Finally, I asked it to rank those five destinations based on probability of success. GO: Have you seen any of this result in new business opportunities? LP: Yes. One location that showed up was Philadelphia. Richmond is four hours from Philadelphia, but like Orlando it hasn't typically been on our radar. However, based on the data from ChatGPT, Philly came up as a recommendation. So we sent one of our sales managers to Philadelphia, and she ended up hosting 18 planners, including some who drove from over an hour away to see her. She got such a great response that I had to jump in and go with her because she couldn't host 18 clients by herself. AI has now informed our sales strategy for Philly, and the region is now part of our dedicated sales strategy. We've allocated funds for that sales manager in Philly to join chapters of organizations like MPI and PCMA. So that's how we know there had to be some accuracy to our approach with AI. GO: How do the sales managers feel about you doing this AI analysis? LP: They appreciate it. It's a balance because most sales managers at DMOs aren't entry level; they've been in hospitality for a long time. This is a new process and a new tool for them. Some have destinations they like to go to over and over because they're successful there. But my role is to support business enablement and sales enablement to help them do what they do better and uncover new business. So how we're using AI provides them with additional actionable research. GO: I think one of the most underrated strategies for AI is developing custom GPTs in ChatGPT to help sales teams develop more customized and effective proposals more quickly. Are you building those at all? LP: Yes, definitely. About a month and a half ago, I programmed a GPT for the sales team called "Prospecting Partner." It's trained on our sales collateral and all our information, so it knows our convention packages and understands our jurisdiction and seven localities. The sales managers have been using it to prospect smarter. I included suggested prompts to go beyond just, "Give me a prospecting email." We can get really specific, like, "Help me re-engage an association planner who just lost grant funding." It also provides strategies specifically related to that, and then you can ask how to execute those strategies. So, for example, we know from reports that finance and insurance is an opportunity market for us. It's a small percentage of our current business but it has the highest average daily rate, which makes it very attractive to our hotel partners. So our salespeople are asking ChatGPT for ways we can develop business in the finance and insurance market, and really dig into that. Ultimately, AI is helping our sales team think bigger, smarter and more strategically. I've asked the sales team if they found this helpful, and, you know, salespeople are not an easy crowd. They said yes across the board. With the ChatGPT Enterprise version, I can't see their exact prompts due to privacy, but I can see the number of conversations they're having with the tool, so I know they're actively using it. GO: How are other people on your team using AI? LP: My two direct reports are our CRM database administrator and our sales coordinator. My sales coordinator does support work for the entire team, so she's using ChatGPT a lot for ideation, like when a sales manager needs an itinerary to entertain clients in Chicago. My CRM database administrator uses ChatGPT as a communication assistant because sometimes analytical personality types can benefit from exploring more communication nuances. She's also started incorporating it into data cleanup, using it to analyze reports and suggest what's missing or what would be beneficial. She uses it to help fill in gaps and identify what's not being asked or said. GO: What are some of your future plans with AI? LP: We're launching microsites for destination sales and sports, and I think it will set a model for the rest of the organization because we’re replacing our website from pre- to post-AI, like most DMO sites these days. We're currently writing copy for the microsites, and I've been getting into structured data and semantic clarity. You don't search ChatGPT or prompt ChatGPT with the same language you search Google, so content has to be written differently. Previously, you'd go to Google and say "restaurants near me." Now with ChatGPT, it's more of a conversation, so you'll say, "Hey, I'm in Scott's Addition historic district in Richmond with my kids, and we're looking for a vegan restaurant." That semantic clarity allows AI to respond with much more specific answers. I think we need to anticipate AI searches, as opposed to Google searches, in how we write content. Everyone is subconsciously expecting a personally curated experience today. When I go on Amazon, I'm expecting it to make connections that I like this, so I might also like this, without me having to tell it certain things. That's where we have to move towards, or we get eclipsed or become obsolete, especially if we're just thinking of ourselves as brokers for a destination. Greg Oates

Visit Phoenix CEO on Leading AI Strategy and Being Chill About It Jul 28 Written By Greg Oates I learned a lot about how DMO leaders can confidently integrate AI processes into their organizations after speaking with Ron Price, CDME, president and CEO of Visit Phoenix. Price is somewhat new to AI but his staff have been doing cool things with various LLMs for a while. He says his primary role with AI is providing the Visit Phoenix team with an enabling environment for success built on a culture of trust. Price accomplishes that by inspiring everyone to experiment with AI, be aware of the liabilities, share their wins, have fun with it, reach out to others for advice, and most of all, validate everything. Although, what stood out for me the most talking with Price is his calm and clear approach to AI, basically inferring (in my words, not his)... "We got this. We might do something amazing today with AI or we might not, but either way we're fully committed to seeing what it can do. We're also going to figure this AI thing out by collaborating with our many DMO industry friends. Because AI is going to change everything in a hurry, and we at Visit Phoenix are not going to be caught staring out at a Sonoran sunset while the world passes our city by." That's the vibe I got. That's leadership. That's what being a CEO means, at least for me. AI is confusing, sure, and CEOs have to worry about their boards and electeds. The thing is, we're more than two and a half years into generative AI now, and it's not going to wait for CEOs to decide if they can "trust AI" or not. I think we can all learn from Price a few things: We can de-escalate all the hubris and hand-wringing surrounding AI by being open to possibilities and having a clear set of principles, especially related to responsible AI use and verification. You can have fun with AI and focus on business outcomes at the same time. The DMO industry needs to collaborate and share best practices more intentionally to accelerate AI education, innovation and integration. We must encourage DMO staff to use AI today so they can steer the future of our industry tomorrow. Price likes talking about AI. I would encourage any DMO CEOs on the fence with AI to reach out to him. Greg Oates: Ron, how do you use AI? Ron Price: I use AI every single day, going back now about a month and a half. I'm just fascinated and interested in what it's able to do. I wouldn't say I'm an early adopter, of course, although there are some people who aren't even on it yet. Me personally, I use it for everything, like if I'm curious about something that's happening within the region. Or maybe I want to quickly compile a lot of data to help solve a problem or answer questions as I get ready for different meetings. More or less, my brain is always just firing, like, "What if we tried this or that?" And so, this year has been a cool realization about what AI can do, and seeing how it's pulling all the sources through to validate what it responds with. We have also integrated AI with Microsoft Copilot. We pay for everyone to have access to that, and then we also have a ChatGPT Team account for our staff. GO: Where else are you seeing value with AI at Visit Phoenix? RP: In our world, it's marketing, it's content. I love being surrounded by people who can write really well. It's an art to me, and I don't possess that art. It's like someone playing the piano. I'm in awe of that. So AI gives people the ability to write better, and it's okay to lean into it. Don't feel threatened by it. AI is able to give you that one golden nugget, or it suggests that one good idea that can really help someone when they're writing. Here's the fun part. Every day, we're learning something unique. We have the Cronkite School of Journalism in Phoenix, and some of the students are here. We kind of give them free rein, and we're also teaching them at the same time. The way that they use AI is amazing. It's fun to walk down the hall to see them because I'm always like, "How did you write that? How did you create that image? How did you pull that data and research together?" It's just a different generation. We're also seeing where our people are asking AI things like, "If I'm a salesperson, how do I influence a group to come here in the middle of the summer for a conference? Why is it fun to be here for a conference when it's 110 degrees out?" And what does AI have to say? Well, one thing that's great about, say, Grok, for example, it's pulling from all these little texts on Twitter, or X. They're from people saying, "Hey, I know it's summertime in Phoenix but look what I got to do." Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use. GO: Does your staff using AI increase your organization's impact in the community? RP: We not only focus on growing tourism in our community, but we're also joined at the hip with economic development. We look at our role as we're here to build a better community through tourism. And so, when you think about utilizing all the data out there, we always ask ourselves, "How could AI help us consolidate that data and crunch the numbers faster to give us a clearer picture of what we think we know?" For example, how much business that comes in through our leads touch our priority sectors? And of those sectors, which ones align extremely well with what we're doing here at Visit Phoenix? Is it semiconductors? Is it bio-med? Is it something that leans into the engineering side because of what ASU and the Department of Defense are doing? We've seen we can go back and look at the data and get a better picture of those things now. Also, as an example, we have a high propensity to book business around the semiconductor space. So we're utilizing these AI tools to quickly do research like, "Give me a list of the top semiconductor conferences that take place around the world." The responses are quicker and the results are better versus doing a traditional Google search. It's able to pull from a lot of different sources, so that's another way we're using AI. “Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use.” GO: How do you define the role of a CEO to guide a DMO forward with AI? RP: Setting up the rules of the game is important. There are areas of liability we have to be aware of about what you can and can't be pulling in. Those are the types of things we needed to figure out, you know, basically, "What is our rule book for using AI?" I like giving people the ability to use AI as they will. I think it works best whenever people know that it's a tool we want them to utilize. And if it can help us at the end of the day tell a better story, be smarter as we go after business, and be smarter with our analytics to help build our marketing strategy stronger, then use it. I try to build a team of leaders so they're CEOs of their own divisions, and I want them to be thought leaders in their areas. Also, I think AI enables us to get to answers quickly, but, and this is important, how do we validate those answers? We're really good at Visit Phoenix when it comes to validating answers, but we're usually doing it by going the long way and understanding how AI responded like it did. We're reading source by source by source, and then we kind of come to our own conclusion. It's like we're not just focused on the punch line of a joke. We can also tell you the structure of the joke. You always have to validate. We get excited about using AI because it just puts us in a new position. I think it's good to have a CEO that supports that, but that support comes from a trust within the organization. I trust that people are going to utilize AI to help make us better. GO: What keeps you up at night regarding AI? RP: My fear is how do we control and ensure that someone isn't producing something negative on our behalf, and then launching it to the world, and using this incredible tool to hurt us? Because there are people that are extremely gullible who believe whatever they're looking at. That's kind of where my brain goes sometimes. It's only because of what I've already seen these tools can do. I think across the DMO industry, we'll have some "ahas," especially when we get together in various forums to exchange ideas. We need to be talking with each other about, "Here are some things that work really well with AI, and here are the headwinds." And then, "These are the things you need to realize could happen with AI, and here are some ways you can mitigate those problems." The more we can learn from others about how they're using AI, the better. I think what you're putting together about AI strategy with all your insights is going to be extremely valuable. GO: Thank you. So, what are you thinking about next with AI? RP: As AI continues to grow, and we've talked about it here internally, what is the value of a website? In fact, we just started our next fiscal year, July 1. Website visits is no longer a key metric that we're going after. As a leader, I like knowing what's three steps ahead. We currently have these tools, but how are they going to change the way we make decisions going forward? At some point, a lot of what we're talking about now is going to be white noise. And what then? It doesn't mean our jobs of promoting a destination change. It means we're going to get so much better at telling our story through so many different avenues. I believe that our reach is actually going to broaden. We're still going to be responsible for promoting our destination and selling our destination, but how we tell the story and how we show the story is going to change as these tools evolve. Back in the day, a lot of us were reading about Moore's Law and how things just keep improving and getting cheaper, especially in technology. Now we're moving into a space where the rate of growth with AI is going to be something we've never seen before. Greg Oates

German Convention Bureau Leader on the Future of AI-Powered Meetings Jul 27 Written By Greg Oates After the global financial crisis ended in 2011, a few cities and nations around the world began promoting themselves to meeting and convention organizers based on their intellectual capital, versus venues and attractions. Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau (GCB), led this strategy in Europe at the time. Around the same year, I was visiting the House of Logistics & Mobility (HOLM) think tank in Frankfurt. The GCB suggested I visit there to better understand this new direction for attracting high-value business events in advanced industries. "The city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," Dr. Stefan Walter told me, who was a professor at HOLM at the time. "So, this [GCB] strategy is about finding the strengths of our strengths, our core competencies, and for Germany, that’s knowledge and infrastructure. It’s also about connecting ideas.” That has been my due north working in the travel industry ever since. This idea that meeting planners and attendees can tap into a deep knowledge base in a host destination, specific to their interests, for me, is intoxicating. The challenge is it takes a ton of work connecting local leaders in specific advanced industries, like aviation in Frankfurt or e-mobility in Stuttgart, with large global organizations in those same industries and convince them to bring their big annual event to Germany. It's also pretty high level. From an attendee standpoint, if I'm in Hamburg and want to learn about HafenCity, the largest urban makeover in Europe, it's not like I can easily access a bunch of people and organizations leading the future of urban development. Which, would be cool, right? AI is helping make that a reality. Germany's national Open Data/Knowledge Graph project is an ambitious AI-powered initiative to build a massive network of industry suppliers, academic organizations and business leaders across the country. Basically, by indexing the visitor industry and intellectual capital supply chain, Germany can connect the brightest minds in Germany with the rest of the world more seamlessly, effectively and equitably. An "interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," if you will. I spoke with Mr. Schultze to learn more about how AI is impacting the meetings and convention industry in Germany. Greg Oates: How is AI evolving across Germany's visitor industry? Specifically, how are your municipal CVBs and other partners thinking about and using AI right now? Matthias Schultze: Like much of the world, things really accelerated for us around two years ago with the rise of tools like ChatGPT. Suddenly, everyone, from corporates to associations, started thinking seriously about AI. We saw an opportunity and created an innovation platform called ebx.lab . It’s a peer-to-peer learning community for event planners, where we partner with scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute to explore how AI might reshape the business events space. From those early sessions, we have published a few white papers and identified a few core insights. AI clearly has potential to personalize experiences, optimize event planning processes, improve engagement and networking, and maybe most exciting, support predictive analytics. That last one, especially, being able to anticipate trends or behaviors based on data, is what feels most transformative to me personally. GO: How is the GCB embracing AI internally? MS: We developed our own internal AI strategy for the German Convention Bureau. We wanted to give both our team and our stakeholders a shared framework, something that outlined where we are today, where we want to go, and how we get there. It’s called "Driven by People, Powered by Data," and that title really reflects our belief that AI is a tool, not a solution in itself. People need to lead the process. The strategy helps us clarify not just what we can do with AI, but also what we can’t or shouldn’t do, at least not yet. It outlines our roadmap and aligns everyone across our organization and membership. GO: Is that strategy available publicly? MS: Yes, though only in German for now. But with the right AI tools, you can translate it quickly. The strategy touches on everything from marketing and communications to event planning, workflow automation, customer personalization, sustainability, and even ethics and compliance. The ethics component is particularly important. As exciting as AI is, we have to keep guardrails in place. Within our organization, we’re working hard to ensure that AI isn’t something siloed or limited to leadership. It needs to be embedded across every level. Everyone in the organization is expected to develop basic AI literacy. We’ve also worked on minimum viable products for things like dashboards and customer-facing chatbots. Some are already in use today. GO: You've always been a strong and vocal proponent for sustainability in business events. How is AI supporting you there? MS: I’m very proud of a project we developed with 29 other European countries: the Sustainability Hub for Events . It’s an AI-driven platform that brings together all kinds of sustainability related data—certifications, guidelines, best practices—and makes them accessible through an interactive AI agent. Planners can ask things like, “Can you help me build a sustainable menu?” or input event details to estimate their CO₂ footprint. It’s highly practical, and it’s making a real difference for event planners who need fast, reliable and actionable sustainability information. GO: We've talked about your Open Data and Knowledge Graph project in Germany numerous times in the past. Is that now live? MS: It’s technically live but still in progress, and probably always will be, in a sense. We’re continuously expanding it. The Open Data Germany project by the German National Tourist Board is live with its Knowledge Graph. The Open Data MICE project, which is implemented in close cooperation with the GNTB, is not yet live. One exciting element launching soon is an interactive map of research institutions in Germany. It will show where key research and innovation is taking place, including medical tech, renewable energy and so on, and link that data to infrastructure like hotels and conference venues. The idea is to visualize Germany as a knowledge landscape. If you’re planning an event and you want to anchor it around a theme like urban mobility, the map will show you which regions are most active in that field and match you with the relevant venues and experts. GO: One theme I keep obsessing about, and it's felt like a bit of a fantasy for more than a decade, is that the city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine. That idea is a direct quote from your House of Logistics and Mobility in Frankfurt, and it’s stuck with me ever since I heard it back in 2011. It's this idea of a city as a platform. Do you think we're getting closer to executing on this idea, where innovation at all levels is more accessible and shareable for more people? Ultimately what we're talking about here is the democratization of knowledge and excellence. MS: I love that idea. I really do. I think there are two layers to it. On one level, we have the smart city movement with systems that integrate transportation, energy, data and infrastructure to make better decisions. That’s already happening in many places across Europe. But on a deeper level, regarding your fantasy.... Let's say you could land in Munich, be interested in urban tech, and immediately connect with people, events and institutions aligned with that interest—that’s becoming possible too. The data already exists. It’s just scattered. But with open data standards, machine readability, and the right AI tools, we can start connecting those dots. Your fantasy city may not be so far off.

A CEO's Playbook for AI Integration Oct 10 Written By Greg Oates Your competitors are talking about AI. Your board is asking about AI. Your partners want to see your AI strategy. Many DMOs are debating the potential of AI, while an increasing number of others are already extracting real business and organizational value. The difference isn't budget or technical talent. It's knowing exactly where to look for opportunities and how to scale what works. 3 Non-Negotiables You Must Lead This, Not Delegate It: AI transformation dies in committee. The organizations seeing real results have CEOs who champion specific initiatives, remove bureaucratic friction, and signal that AI adoption is a strategic priority. This doesn't mean micromanaging prompts. It means creating air cover for teams to experiment and fail fast. Complex Impresses, Simple Delivers: Your instinct will be to pursue the flashy, sophisticated AI applications that sound impressive in board presentations. Resist it. The organizations generating real ROI start with mundane problems: expense report processing, meeting summarization, competitive monitoring, etc. These boring use cases build organizational confidence and create the foundation for more ambitious projects. Your People Know Where the Problems Are: The best AI applications emerge from the intersection of daily frustration and technological possibility. Run hackathons. Create cross-functional workshops. Ask your teams what they do that feels like waste. The solutions they surface will be more practical and impactful than anything your consultants recommend. Start Here Stop looking for AI opportunities everywhere. Focus your organization's attention on three specific areas where AI creates immediate, measurable value. The Tedium Tax: Every role in your organization includes mind-numbing tasks that consume time without creating value: data entry, compliance documentation, procurement reports, staff vacation tracking, etc. Think of these as your "Anti To-Do List." These are tasks systematically eliminated by asking, "How can I never have to do this again?" Your teams are paying a tedium tax every day. AI is the refund. The Expertise Bottleneck: Projects stall when teams hit the limits of their skills and wait for other departments. Marketing needs data analysis and campaign design mockups. Finance and HR need custom GPTs. Sales needs meetings-related technical specifications translated into customer language. AI breaks these bottlenecks by giving every team superpowers they never had before. The Blank Page Problem: Knowledge work involves ambiguous challenges where the path forward isn't clear: Strategy development, market analysis, problem diagnosis, etc. AI excels at generating multiple approaches, analyzing incomplete information, and proposing next steps when your teams are stuck. It's the thinking partner that's always available and never runs out of ideas. 6 Use Cases OpenAI's analysis of 600+ successful implementations across various industries reveals that virtually every valuable AI application falls into one of six categories. Show your teams these six use cases and they'll start finding opportunities everywhere. Content Creation: Use AI for first drafts of everything: strategy documents, marketing campaigns, product and experience descriptions, customer and community communications. AI maintains your brand voice while eliminating the blank page problem. Research and Synthesis: AI powers information gathering at superhuman speed, including market analysis, competitive intelligence, customer feedback synthesis, regulatory research, etc.. AI doesn't just find information. It structures it exactly how you need it for decision-making. Coding for Everyone: Your non-technical teams can now write Python scripts, SQL queries, and data visualizations. Your engineering teams debug faster and prototype in unfamiliar languages. AI democratizes technical capability while accelerating your experts. Data Analysis Without Degrees: Upload spreadsheets, dashboard screenshots or raw data files and get structured analysis without requiring PhD-level statistics knowledge. This is arguably the most undervalued opportunity that delivers immediate results for most DMOs. Strategic Thinking Partner: AI is a beast for brainstorming, scenario planning, product and event development, asset mapping, risk analysis, etc. AI helps structure complex problems and identifies considerations your teams might miss. This is my favorite use case for AI. Intelligent Automation: Use platforms like n8n, Relay and others to create repeatable processes that run themselves, such as weekly competitive updates, financial reporting, sales and marketing workflows, a ton of admin duties, etc. Create the process once, then let AI handle the execution while humans focus on exceptions and strategy. Implementation is Where DMOs Fail Most AI initiatives fail because organizations treat them like traditional software deployments. They're not. AI is about change management and behavioral transformation up and down the org chart. AI implementation requires different approaches to discovery, prioritization and scaling. Systematic Opportunity Hunting: Don't wait for AI use cases to emerge organically. Run structured discovery sessions where teams audit their workflows for repetitive tasks, skill bottlenecks, and ambiguous challenges. Make this process ongoing, not a one-time exercise. The Impact-Effort Matrix: Not every AI opportunity deserves attention. Prioritize based on business impact versus implementation effort. Quick wins build momentum. High-value, high-effort projects become strategic investments. Everything else gets parked until technology makes it easier. Innovation as Culture: Internal competitions accelerate discovery while building AI literacy across your organization. The goal isn't technical sophistication. It's practical business solutions that teams actually want to use. Measure What Matters: Track time saved, accuracy improved, costs reduced and capability expansion. But also measure qualitative impacts: employee satisfaction, process improvements, competitive advantages. Use this data to guide scaling decisions. Build Your AI Process Move beyond random experimentation to systematic capability building. I like Estée Lauder's 5-phase process to ensure repeatable success with AI. Does this resonate with you for your DMO? Design: Define your purpose, scope and success criteria for AI integration in a 2-page brief. No scope creep. No technical complexity for its own sake. Prepare: Ask department heads to gather relevant data and best practices. AI tools should reflect organizational knowledge, not generic approaches. Build and Test: Hire contractors where necessary to help teams develop automations/agents, implement training, integrate datasets and validate accuracy. Focus on usability, not just functionality. Launch: Deploy with user guides and change management support. Technology deployment is easy. User adoption across all departments is a total headache at first. Optimize: Feedback loops drive continuous improvement based on actual usage patterns. AI applications evolve with business needs and improved capabilities. Key Insight: Always start with fundamental questions: Why build this? What problem does it solve? What impact will it have? Is the measurement for success quantitative or qualitative? Organizations that answer these questions clearly will build more successful AI applications than those focused primarily on technical capability. Build AI-Native Workflows The most sophisticated implementations integrate AI across entire business processes rather than individual tasks. This evolution positions organizations for the agentic AI capabilities coming next. Process Decomposition: Break complex workflows into constituent tasks, identify where each AI use case category adds value, and create integrated approaches spanning from research through execution. Marketing workflows might integrate research for market understanding, analysis for opportunity mapping, ideation for strategy, content creation for product and destination development, and automation for distribution. Cross-Functional Integration: AI facilitates better collaboration by translating between departments. Technical specifications become marketing language. Customer requirements inform sales priorities. Financial models drive strategic planning. Future-Proofing for Agents: Current workflow integration prepares your organization for AI agents that can complete entire projects independently. Teams that understand how to break processes into AI-addressable components will leverage these capabilities immediately when available. The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done. This cognitive shift creates advantages that compound over time and become increasingly difficult for competitors to replicate. "The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done." Key Takeaways The question isn't whether AI will transform our industry. It's whether you'll be leading that transformation or reacting to it. Start with clear, achievable use cases and systemic approaches to build the organizational muscle needed for transformation. AI advantage isn't about having the most technical teams or biggest budgets. It's about developing capabilities for organization-wide discovery, adoption, implementation and scaling of practical business solutions. The organizations moving beyond experimentation to systematic implementation today will be best positioned to leverage the more sophisticated AI capabilities emerging tomorrow. The agents are coming. Will you be ready? Greg Oates

The ROI of AI Agents Aug 21 Written By Greg Oates Based on a bunch of conversations at DI Annual 2025 this month, it's clear that many DMO executives still equate generative AI primarily with writing and editing in ChatGPT. But as one COO of a large U.S. DMO told me, "Surely there's more to all this than just learning about prompting." So many ways to respond to that. Meanwhile, there are also DMO leaders who established AI road maps for their organizations going back two years. For them, they're increasingly focused on developing AI-powered automated workflows and their more sophisticated cousins, AI agents. The purpose of these synthetic workflows is to automate tedious, time-consuming and repetitive tasks to free up staff to focus on more high-value work. Think of it as an evolution from using AI to building AI. You begin by visually mapping what people do in your organization. Then you identify where AI can potentially take over all the mundane stuff better and faster. I’ve been working with my colleagues at Matador Network to develop automated workflows for our Studio team. We have endless terabytes of client video created during the last 10 years. Now, with AI, we want to capitalize on those existing assets to create new video, but first we need to use AI to understand what we actually own. We contracted Erick Bonilla , founder of Pocho.tech based in Uruguay, to build a series of new AI workflows in n8n. One of the automations is designed to cull through 10 years of video files in Dropbox and catalogue everything in Airtable. The AI then creates standardized file names, project IDs, links for raw edited videos and finished client hero/cutdown videos, and location and content tags. The cost to develop the AI workflow was about $2,000 all-in, and it saved more than a month of work at a mid-level manager salary. The beauty of automations/agents is you can measure ROI annually fairly easily, which will help wake up your board if they're sleeping on AI. Moreover, once an automation is in place, the savings will continue to accrue in the future indefinitely for tasks still required, and there’s zero human error. During a staff Zoom, I asked members of our Studio team if they felt these new agents signaled to them the beginning of the end of some people’s jobs. The response was unanimous. Nobody wants to do this type of repetitive grunt work. I spoke with Bonilla for his take on the future of AI agents. Greg Oates: Erick, what services does Pocho.tech provide? Erick Bonilla: We identify opportunities within organizations of all sizes, where we believe implementing AI systems can dramatically improve the efficiency of operations. We can create workflows that process data, or we can create AI agents capable of reasoning, analyzing data, creating reports, and providing decision-makers with an enhanced way of digesting information. I have been doing this for almost two years, working with people mostly in the Middle East, the US and Latin America. The Pocha company site is brand new as I try to expand in the world of AI. GO: What’s the difference between automated workflows and agents? EB: A workflow is like a mass production factory. It's a set of operations that work through specific logic to automate a repetitive process that a human has done before. This could be writing and reading emails, writing summaries, reformatting and transferring content through different tools and applications, etc. An AI agent is a thinking environment that makes decisions for you. You can set a workflow for reading your emails. But then you can have an AI agent that summarizes your emails and tells you, if you have 10 emails, what those 10 emails are about in just one email, SMS text, WhatsApp message, Google doc or whatever. GO: So an AI agent has more autonomy and decision-making capabilities than an automated workflow? EB: Definitely. The AI agent is capable of being completely autonomous to make decisions within a given context. You give it a context with defined restrictions that narrows the scope of the decisions it can make. GO: Can you provide any success stories where you worked with a client who had a specific challenge, and you created an automated workflow or agent that successfully delivered a solution? EB: The most recent example is an EdTech company in Boston that provides a training and placement program for clean energy jobs. They've been operating for the past five years, but there’s been a lack of funds, employees and program applicants to scale beyond Massachusetts. So they decided to use AI and automation to build flows without having to invest a lot of money in hiring people. What I did was streamline the application process for people interested in entering the educational program. We created a form and a workflow that takes the information from the application and puts it into an application tracking system. This system has workflows that can trigger emails, daily reports, weekly reports and invitations to interview. Then I created an AI agent. Once the applicants are interviewed by a human, we take the transcript of that, analyze it using AI, and build a report for the decision maker so they can decide if this person is capable of entering the program or not. We also created a scoring system. We built it based on human criteria, which is subjective, and then we converted that into an objective dataset so we could classify people and score them based on numbers. All of this is done by an AI agent that sets a score for the applicant at the end of the interview. Then we have a leaderboard where people are ranked, and the top 15 get into the education program and placement process. GO: Were they happy with the end result? EB: Oh yeah, very happy. Here's where the beauty and magic come in. Now the CEO can envision a way of expanding outside Massachusetts, and tell her team, "Hey, we're going to New York!" Where before, she thought she needed to hire more people in each new state to oversee the operation. And, because an AI agent works 24/7, she doesn't have to wait until 8am to get a report or transcription, or anything anymore. So now, she can think about how to scale her company more successfully without having to hire more people. GO: What's the road map looking ahead? Where are you going with the company in terms of next steps? EB: We're trying to create an outreach system because the purpose of the company is not only to train people but also to place them in clean tech job positions. The outreach system is going to help the team find more companies with open positions, so the company can place more people in those positions. We’re building a system involving AI agents and workflows where we're going to take a picture of all the open positions and analyze and understand them using AI. We want to know, what are the requirements in terms of learning and knowledge capacity for people to get in these positions, so the company can build a better training program. GO: What was the biggest challenge working with them? EB: I think the most important one, and this is something anyone working on this will experience, is the resistance of some team members who don't trust the performance of AI enough. People who have low experience working with AI, and maybe only know ChatGPT, will look at this and say, "I don't believe this can work." So that means there’s a lot of educational work. People need enough knowledge about what AI tools are capable of to suggest what can and can’t work. I think that's the main challenge. But once people see it working, they start to lean into AI. Suddenly, they become like, "This is great. Can you add this other metric? Can you make it do this other thing too? Can you make me one for my personal side hustle?" It's interesting when you see people moving from resistance to acceptance. GO: Working with you has firmly cemented something I've been preoccupied with this year. It's this: One of the most exciting things about AI, which is giving us more time back during the day, requires the most boring thing, which is having uniform file and data structure. As we've discovered together only too well, AI can't reach its full potential unless you have everything structured super cleanly. The analogy I often use is that AI is like an 8-year-old savant. The person is brilliant but he or she often needs really consistent environments and clear guardrails, or things go sideways or just crash. Can you talk about what any organization needs to focus on when it comes to file and data structure? EB: I think one of the most basic things, and I'm living this with a company I'm helping right now, is documenting files and folders exactly the same. You must set protocols for everything when you’re building a folder system to store content and data. That's one of the biggest challenges for companies trying to implement AI automation with poorly standardized systems. When we didn’t have AI a few years ago, we didn't think of a machine reading our documents or files. We never thought that could be possible, so we never really focused on creating really good file structure. The biggest challenge for companies, coming back to Matador, is how to organize the field of play so that AI doesn't struggle. We easily lose the excitement of implementing AI in an organization when an AI is trying to navigate a maze of poorly organized files. For that, you need to build SOPs that tell everyone on the team, “We're going to be naming files this way now so that a 5-year-old can read the titles and understand what's in every one of them. Because if a 5-year-old can read this set of folders and understand what's inside all of them, then AI can do that too. And if AI can find and read everything, then AI can do some truly amazing things and save companies a lot of money. GO: So how are organizations like ours, which have been in operation for a long time, supposed to go back decades and reorganize all our files? EB: We can run a workflow that can do that for you. That's where the ROI comes in. You can make a one-time investment building a workflow that's going to completely standardize all your filing and foldering. But if you do that, you have to know that the ROI might not show up right away. It's going to start paying off later in terms of the time, money, stress and everything it’s going to give back. A CEO must understand that the return on that investment is going to be ongoing through the years, not in the next quarter necessarily. If you have that mentality, then your company is going to become AI-first. GO: You’ve told me before that AI is not a tool, it's a culture. Can you explain that? EB: Right now, the biggest obstacle for AI expanding in many companies are the CEOs. I understand the challenges because they fear a lot of reputational risk. You have a board and customers that are going to be judging you. If you don't have a very good AI road map, then it could turn into a failure, and the fingers are going to be pointing at you. I understand that completely. But AI should be a culture within companies, and that starts top down because the CEO has to embrace trial and error. AI is going to fail at least during the first time you start with any automation. It's like when you're building a prompt. We were talking the other day, and you said using AI is not about writing the perfect first prompt. It's that fifth or sixth prompt that's going to get you to the right answer. You're going to be iterating with automation, too. That's something CEOs have to transmit throughout the organization. GO: I think for many tourism organizations, we haven’t even begun talking about the big picture value of AI. From an internal perspective, for example, agents offer a whole new level for optimizing operations with AI. EB: Yes, exactly. When we're in a company and we're facing challenges, the first intuitive thinking is, "How can I solve this? I'm going to Google it.” Now we're transitioning to, "How can I solve this? I'm going to ask ChatGPT.” This is great, but that's not AI-first. That's changing one tool for another. You're still browsing. It's literally the same thing. You're not really using AI. AI-first means, "I do this thing that's consuming 10 hours a week. I do the same thing every time. I spend two hours every day doing the same four steps. How can I use AI to automate this?" That's AI-first because you're using AI to stop wasting time. I think that's the culture we should be striving for. If a CEO injects the whole company with that mindset, then the employees are going to eventually use AI to solve their issues more independently and autonomously. At the end of the day, what AI really does is gives us more time and more of our lives back, and we have not yet understood that because it's new. But it's true, AI is the way for humans to have more life. GO: I want that. EB: We all do. GO: I have this belief that eventually, in any organization, all meetings will be recorded and deposited into a central knowledge base where an AI can summarize everything and connect all the key takeaways. I might have a meeting and someone on the other side of the world has a meeting, and the AI will know we're talking about the same thing. It will see and surface how there's potential opportunity to connect our efforts. It's like one plus one equals three, or more. Do you think that's where we're going and that it will benefit companies? EB: Definitely. It's the most common sense thing to do, but I know it's also counterintuitive because there are many people who would not like to have all conversations recorded. The fidelity, the accuracy of the information, and it all being in one place and uniformly structured, is everything. You can have thousands of conversations and tell the AI, "Go here and search for this specific idea in all the transcripts where we have talked about that." You just need to build the SOPs. Then a human can quality control it and say, "This is right. This isn't right. Maybe we can tweak this, or build on that." GO: I’ve experienced this firsthand where people are vehemently against this idea of all company meetings being recorded. For many it portends that clichéd dystopic future we see in science fiction, where everything's controlled and you have no freedom, right? EB: I can see it too. We must remember that these tools can be turned off. If we let the technology control us, then that's on us. I think at the end of the day, it's about how do you balance the risk and rewards? This is something CEOs are used to. Do you prefer to live in blindness and have an uncompetitive company because you decided not to take that risk with automation? Or do you take the risk and have everything recorded, even though some people are going to say it’s Orwellian in a way, and even though ultimately it's going to improve everybody's life? We have to find that balance, and that’s the CEO’s role to determine what’s best overall for the company, customers and employees in the future. GO: Any last thoughts? EB: I think we are not quite there yet to know for sure the amount of ROI that is going to come from agents and automations. Definitely it is going to be positive ROI. For that, I'm completely sure. What I'm not sure is how do we measure ROI based on the anticipated lifetime value of the process? So much is changing so quickly and it's difficult to see the future. As the tools get better, then the workflow gets better too, so the ROI increases, right? Except, we don't really have models for that. For CEOs, I think, they have to try to envision how they can measure the value of automations now, and how that might evolve exponentially in the future. Greg Oates

What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates CEOs at destination marketing and management organizations (DMOs) are seeking AI guidance specifically tailored to their chief executive roles. A CEO in the U.S. told me recently that current AI education is often too surface level, vague, unstructured, or trying to cover too much ground to be useful for a chief executive. He said, "We've been talking for a while now about how we need AI education targeting leadership, but it doesn't really exist." While destination leaders face many more questions about AI than answers, one thing is 100% clear: CEOs must own and lead their organizations' AI integration across all departments. AI isn't something to outsource or delegate to others, and it's not a "marketing thing" for the CMO to figure out. Conor Grennan , chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, consults with clients on AI strategy from JPMorgan to NASA. I asked him how important it is for CEOs to lead AI education, adoption and integration across their organizations. “CEOs have to understand how to use AI and why; they really have to have felt the delight about what AI can do,” he said. "They also have to see clearly how AI is a leadership and change management challenge, not a tech challenge. Then they need to start out being vulnerable, and be able to say, ‘Hey, I was skeptical about AI. I didn’t understand it, either. But now I can explain the way I learned it and how to communicate why it’s important to help other people understand it.” So why do CEOs need to understand AI? Jeff Bezos answered that at The New York Times DealBook Summit last year. He described how “modern AI is a horizontal enabling layer" that will soon be integrated into every device and digital application in existence. "These kind of horizontal layers like electricity and compute and now artificial intelligence, they go everywhere," he said. "I guarantee you there is not a single application that you can think of that is not going to be made better by AI." Here's the clip: Strategic AI Approaches I met with about a dozen CEOs in North America to find out what they want to know about AI specifically from a CEO perspective. Some leaders are seeking big-picture guidance with a broad overview of high-level strategy. "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” one CEO told me. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" Another chief executive said, “We see three areas of opportunity for AI: Administrative tasks and general productivity; marketing chat, SEO and data readiness; and helping customers find information about our city more effectively.… The two most important things I want to know are how to develop AI policy and how is AI changing SEO." A year ago, most CEOs had a wait-and-see attitude about AI, following how the technology evolved and what their cohorts in other organizations were doing. Today, there is a general consensus among CEOs that they need to invest in AI, but the question is how and where. One CEO told me he knows he needs to integrate AI tools and processes into his DMO, but he has three overarching questions that he wants answered first, at least at a high level: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” Other CEOs are seeking clarity on the basic fundamentals of AI: "I need to understand what are the problems that we're trying to solve with AI. What is the purpose of a chatbot, for example? What am I buying, and what can we as an organization accomplish with it?" And then others just want immediate actionable solutions: "I'm not interested in hypotheticals. Show me five ways I can implement AI on Monday. Give me turnkey AI solutions that work today." AI Data is King Personalized data is one of generative AI’s biggest value propositions. Conversational AI (chat) is the new marketplace, and it’s eating the entire funnel including in-destination engagement. In some cities, AI chat conversations between DMOs and visitors is exceeding 25% in-destination, giving DMOs a way to influence visitor behavior in real time. Also, in some industry segments like tours and activities, in-chat conversations are driving in-destination bookings with partners like GetYourGuide. Everyone is looking for first/zero-party data around that. “We have a low level of proprietary data about who is in our destination and what they’re doing,” asserted one CEO. “We have a few disparate data sources, but we need to connect those, and we want to be able to use it predictively. For example, we're looking at regression analysis to help develop future scenario modeling, and we're looking at AI to help us with that." Another CEO said, “We need data that provides material value for our partners. That’s our mandate. How are our visitors spending money and where? How are they behaving and traveling through our area? How can we help people find our partners in a more personalized way?” And one CEO added, "A key priority for us is figuring out the data equation so outbound messaging can be tailored to a 1-on-1 relationship.” Striving for that direct individual customer engagement has been the holy grail for marketers for decades. The ability to deliver mass personalization at scale is now coming into focus with enhanced AI data curation. National organizations like Destination Canada and Germany Travel have invested millions of dollars in data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to restructure their tourism product data from scratch, capitalize on the data more effectively to rank higher in AI search, and drive incremental revenue to partners. That's what the future looks like. For more information, check out the new Canadian Tourism Data Collective and Germany's Open Data Project . Today, local tourism organizations are starting to see how data structure and content architecture are strategic imperatives for them, too. One municipal CEO explained, "I think it might almost be too early to have this conversation in some areas until AI matures more. One thing I am eager to know now is how do we develop a data lake to structure our own data and messaging to make it easier for AI search tools to find." AI search and SEO are a huge conversation today. During the past year, the #1 question I heard while speaking about AI with dozens of North American destination organizations, their boards and key industry/community stakeholders, was: How do we rank higher in AI search? What happens when AI buries organic content? What’s going to happen to our websites? Are they going to disappear? Is a DMO without a website still a DMO? How do we need to produce content differently? And, what the heck is a data lake? One CEO I spoke with is planning on developing a new website for her organization. She said, "I don't even know what I don't know about AI search, but we need to figure some of that out before we start spending any money." Along with data, defining KPIs for AI integration is a hot topic of debate, and presently there isn’t a complete and codified list of metrics that DMO leaders agree on. That said, perhaps the travel and tourism industry collectively needs to understand what AI is, and what it can accomplish at scale, before attaching too many metrics to it. A CMO told me at DI MarCom Summit this month, “People didn’t ask about ROI with the internet when it first came around. We just knew we had to have it,” because it was a new channel for reaching visitors. Same as AI now. Expanding on that, he suggested that DMOs need to break AI success tracking into awareness metrics and performance metrics, and get that conversation right before anything else. Staff AI Adoption Unlike previous technology evolutions, there doesn’t seem to be as much of a generational divide between early adopters of AI and everyone else. The industry can’t look to Gen Z for guidance about how to use AI to the same degree we once asked Millennials for insights about Instagram. Again, driving AI adoption across an organization begins with the CEO. Once that’s established, the real challenge is convincing department leaders and staff to lean into AI. It's a challenge because there is widespread concern, skepticism and/or suspicion among many staff members across many industries that they’re being asked to learn new technologies that will eventually replace them. Leadership should say to employees that no one can force them to use AI, but the job market will. The data is clear. According to the Linkedin/Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index : 79% of leaders agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with Al skills than a more experienced one without 66% of leaders won’t hire someone without AI skills 60% of leaders worry their organization lacks a plan and vision to implement AI And that's a year old. But, understandably, emphasizing those numbers comes across as threatening. A better strategy for driving AI adoption is finding staff members who are already seeing success with AI, supporting them with access to education and pro AI models, and working out from there. The more employees see their colleagues using AI, the more some of them feel inclined to lean in. Therefore, every DMO needs a comprehensive strategic AI road map that includes purpose, policy, education, integration and a continuous feedback loop across all levels of staff. CEOs need to create a space for that. "We're giving our staff time to play around with AI, but they have to present what they're focusing on and what they're learning to their individual supervisor," a CEO told me. Another added, “We're focusing on staff adoption. But I need you to explain to me what works, how to implement, and what should I watch out for." I'm presently working with our departments at Matador Network to explore a bunch of various AI models to optimize workflows, boost creativity, enhance strategic planning, diversify product, etc. There's a well-communicated mandate from the top that Matador will become an AI-first company, and sooner than later. To help accelerate that, we created an AI task force to bring more perspectives from across the company together to integrate AI into operations. That has been valuable with some immediate takeaways, such as staff is now reaching out and asking for assistance with AI. But it's only a start. "There's this idea that if you can get a core group of people using AI then their attitudes and behaviors will spread organically throughout the rest of the company," said Conor Grennan at NYU. "It doesn't work that way. You have to find the people who have fears about AI and listen to them to understand why. You have to say, 'Yes, AI does suck at that, but here's what it's good at.' You also need to weed out the negative people who are against AI outright. They're dangerous." 5 Key Takeaways Let's go back to that first CEO who wants to know the five big questions about AI. Based on the input from the above CEOs, here's a first stab at that: How can I create AI policy that serves our organization but doesn't suppress experimentation among staff? (Interestingly, policy did not come up that much with the CEOs I spoke with.) How do we need to develop our websites, content and data to rank higher in AI search? How is AI SEO different, and the same, as old SEO? What are existing AI chat platforms accomplishing, how are visitors using them, and how are they influencing travel decision making and purchase behavior? If AI is not just for marketing, what does the ecosystem of AI tools for all departments look like across the organization? And what do they do in terms of increasing productivity, creativity and quality? How do I get staff to buy in? We know AI is an imperative for our organization's competitive advantage and relevance. And we know AI is an imperative for employees for their professional growth and marketability. But how do we get our people to really believe in the need to embrace AI? Greg Oates

Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Royce Chwin, president and CEO of Destination Vancouver , personifies how a DMO chief executive needs to establish and articulate the mandate for integrating AI across the organization. That was the topic of our last Destination AI post where 12 CEOs explained: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . Early in 2024, Chwin addressed the full staff in Destination Vancouver’s office before a session I was presenting there on AI. “We cannot not do this,” he said, stating that the organization needed to adopt AI processes to stay relevant in the industry and increase its value in the community. If Destination Vancouver is positioning itself as an innovative DMO, he explained, then the road ahead with AI was clear. Since then, Destination Vancouver launched a new website fully integrated with AI where visitors can customize how they find travel information. The build was a two-year process requiring an inordinate amount of learning to capitalize on generative AI. The team also developed an AI policy guide that Chwin shared for this post. The comprehensive document is designed to "provide clear protocols that maximize and encourage the use of Al tools where appropriate and safe to do so, while minimizing any potential risks and concerns." The policy guide encourages staff to use AI for "enhancing productivity, efficiency, creativity or decision-making." It defines when not to use AI models and how staff is required to review and validate all AI outputs for accuracy and bias. Also, Stefan Hawes, vp of global marketing, initiated the development of an internal AI Council, bringing together a diverse group of staff to coordinate AI processes across the organization. Chwin shared an internal briefing report outlining the purpose of the Council as follows: It is recommended that an AI Council be established immediately to provide a centralized body for managing AI-related initiatives and to expand training opportunities for team members. The Council will focus on: Setting strategic priorities related to AI Selecting use cases, implementing projects/initiatives/AI software purchases and evaluating their effectiveness Developing a data strategy to support AI adoption and initiatives Developing an AI education, literacy and adoption program Ensuring ethical compliance Fostering cross-departmental collaboration to maximize the impact of AI projects We created a similar AI task force at Matador, and the value of that cannot be overstated to better assess how staff from different departments perceive, and misperceive, AI in general. I talked with Chwin this week to better understand how a DMO CEO can best lead strategic AI implementation across his or her organization. The purpose of this post is to help inform, inspire and influence other CEOs to consider the opportunities of AI in a new light. Greg Oates: Royce, you've been a strident proponent of AI for a couple years now, and yet there are many other CEOs who are still reticent. How did you personally come to decide Destination Vancouver needed to embrace AI? Royce Chwin: The perception still of some DMOs is that we are behind when it comes to technology. We're slow to adapt. We're slow to evolve. You see all these other organizations in the travel sphere around us that are able to move much quicker. They might be capitalized better. They can adjust. They can pivot quicker to take on these new technologies, and they can experiment seemingly without the degree of fear or consternation that maybe some DMOs have. So, I think there's lots of different reasons. For us, I mean, it's day and night. We can't not do that. Our entire ecosystem that we play in has some level of AI being used. Number one is our customers. They’re using AI. So it goes back to that same idea that you and I have discussed many times before: How do we as a DMO stay relevant and how do we show value? AI is a response to answering those two things. GO: In many organizations today, there’s often skepticism and suspicion among staff about how AI might take their jobs, or they’re dismissive of AI altogether. How does your team feel about AI overall? RC: I'm not finding a fear in our organization for using AI. I think it's a different set of challenges. I think there are so many derivatives of AI out there that people don't know what to focus on. Because you can’t and don't need to focus on 40 different AI tools. The question is, what are the best tools that are most relevant to the work that I need to do? That, I think, in my experience is a bigger challenge. My sense of it is that AI can be so overwhelming. It can seem unbelievably complicated. So we had to ask ourselves, do we have the time, resources and skill sets to simply understand it? Secondly, are we asking better questions to understand what in the organization we need to solve, and can AI help? GO: In a previous post, I shared input from 12 DMO CEOs about how they feel about AI. What are you hearing from other CEOs? RC: I was over in Europe recently for Destinations International’s Global Leaders Forum where I was onstage with Sherrif Karamat (CEO of PCMA) and Petra Stušek (CEO at Ljubljana Tourism). We were talking about the importance of face-to-face meetings and so on, and Sherrif made a comment that DMOs are really behind using AI. It was kind of a blanket statement, and he's not wrong. But, I said to Sheriff that I think a lot of DMOs are behind because it's like throwing confetti in somebody's face and asking them to pick the best pieces. They don't even know what they're trying to evaluate, and it’s also moving so fast. In the meantime, our customers are running around us using AI for all kinds of things. And so I think that there's not so much a fear of using AI. It’s more that people are questioning how to respond to the increasing emergence of AI because they’re thinking, “I'm not really 100% clear on the business problem I'm trying to solve that supports my mandate.” For us, and you saw it when you visited, we were really clear on what it is that we needed to do. We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI. “We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI.” GO: I’ve been asserting that CEOs should own and lead AI adoption in their organizations to have the best chance for success. I don't mean lead it day to day. I mean the chief executive must establish the mandate that AI is something the organization is going to invest in, and articulate why and how to the entire staff. Connor Grennan, chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, emphasized to me that’s the only way this works. Do you agree? RC: Yes, I absolutely believe it must come from the CEO because the CEO has to clear the vision with the team. And with something as seismic as AI, and how it’s evolving in our daily life, in our world, I think the CEO has a responsibility to address it and how it will impact the organization. Everyone needs to understand how we’re going to use AI in alignment with our mission and strategic goals, and how it will support the mandate. That's all CEO level. That's the responsibility on my head. Also, I can't imagine going in front of my Board and asking, “Hey, what are you doing with AI? What should we do with AI?” So it has to come from the CEO, but my Board has also enabled me. Like, there's no grief from my Board. Zero. We are fully enabled. GO: You've created the necessary structure to help govern AI integration with your AI Policy and AI Council. Can you expand on the thinking behind those? RC: We developed an AI policy that’s designed to enable people to use AI and not discourage them from experimenting. Obviously, some education is required in terms of proprietary information and those kinds of things. But we're really leaning into this and we're going to assign some time for it to enable the organization to experiment and play with AI without fear of reprisal. Naturally there needs to be governance around it, but governance does not mean stopping creativity. Governance means we’re creating and delivering new opportunities for creativity. There just needs to be structure around that. Also, Stefan came up with the idea of pulling together an AI Council in the organization, which I think is fantastic. We're getting individuals from each business line, including myself, and we’re going to talk about AI, its impacts, what we need to be thinking about, and how we'll improve our website and the organization as a whole. So we're creating dialogue around it to define opportunities. For example, I'm really excited about AI as it relates to all the country market analysis that we do. We've been doing that by spreadsheet, but now we’re exploring AI to provide the insights we need to inform our market planning more effectively. There are lots of different examples like that, but you only discover them by being open to experimenting with AI. Greg Oates

Toronto & Denver Tourism Leaders on the 5 Big AI Questions for CEOs Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates A year from now, the travel and tourism sector might look back and thank Andrew Weir, president and CEO of Destination Toronto , for catalyzing how DMOs move forward with AI. At PCMA Convening Leaders in January this year, I asked Weir what CEOs need to understand about AI at a high level. Numerous other CEOs have told me there’s a complete lack of AI education specifically designed for DMO chief executives. His answer was first shared anonymously in our previous post, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” said Weir. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" At the end of that post I suggested what those five questions might be based on all the CEO insights in there, and I've since been shopping them around to vet them. A few weeks ago, for example, Richard Scharf, president and CEO at Visit Denver , suggested restructuring the questions to create a more logical hierarchy. Now, the first three deal with internal operations while the last two identify external, visitor-facing priorities. Yesterday, I spoke again with Weir, as well as Paula Port, vice president of marketing at Destination Toronto, for their input on the five questions. The goal here is to provide clear structure around AI platforms and processes for DMOs leading up to Matador Network’s collaboration with U.S. Travel at ESTO in Phoenix this fall. Together, we’ll be co-hosting an interactive, multi-station “AI Playground” educational activation during the three days of the conference. Here are the five big AI questions. These will evolve but now we have a foundation to begin building consensus on how DMOs can capitalize on opportunities and navigate challenges with AI today. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The 5 Big AI Questions 1. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? A growing number of DMO leaders say their teams embrace AI for the most part, and many are actively developing basic AI strategy. That’s a significant shift from a year ago. At the same time, there's still varying degrees of cynicism and skepticism about AI in other organizations. I asked Weir about his staff. “I don't feel like we're dragging the team into this,” he said. “It's really more a matter of how people are at such different places with AI. So our goal is figuring out how to channel all their knowledge and energy, and kind of align and unify that, without stifling anyone’s creativity.” Scharf at Visit Denver emphasized that this question should be the first one, because successful AI integration begins with understanding your staff’s grasp of AI and their appetite for leaning into it. “ChatGPT is growing like Zoom did a few years ago so we know we need to use it,” he said. “The first thing we did was survey staff to assess how they feel about AI, and how or if they’re using it. Then we started off with small bites like email. Now we think of AI as a toolkit, and we're continuing to explore what tools are appropriate for different needs.” Port added that AI integration across teams works best with both structured and self-directed learning. “We started by making everything (ChatGPT Plus, Google Gemini) available to everyone, so they were given access to tools and resources, but a lot of this is really self-directed learning,” she said. “What we're seeing now is people have taken advantage of that and moved forward with it. Some maybe a little bit further than others, so maybe we need to address that. I think we still need more use cases and more structured learning because we're not all at the same level in terms of knowing and understanding how to put AI to use.” 2. How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? Destination Toronto was one of the first North American municipal DMOs to develop an AI policy. They began the process by pulling examples from larger government-operated tourism organizations including Destination Canada and Destination British Columbia. “We set up that policy structure first in terms of what we wanted as an organization, and also being very clear that any use of AI was meant to drive business results,” said Weir. “I think we were able to get there pretty quickly because we didn't create a series of regulations. We built a series of philosophies and principles to guide where we go. It was meant to put guardrails around protecting information, while at the same time, stimulate learning and sharing. Because we said to the team that you are free and encouraged to use AI, but there is an expectation that you will share what you've learned.” Port explained further that, “We leveraged existing processes already in place from a content perspective in terms of bias, IT usage, etc. We have an assessment process for any sort of software application that we're looking to use, so we did the same with AI.” (Note: The next GuideGeek Destination AI post will be with Kara Franker, president and CEO of Visit Florida Keys, who is also an attorney. We discussed AI policy at length.) 3. How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? Scharf stated that integrating AI platforms and processes beyond marketing is “where all the work is happening now.” His organization is switching out regular stand up meetings with extended AI workshops and visiting speakers to learn more about AI tools for various use cases across departments. Leadership, he said, including himself, are present at these meetings so everyone is learning together. Weir and Port both addressed this question, saying they need to first explore how Simpleview, Cvent and other tech partners are integrating AI functionality before looking at any new AI platforms. We discussed PCMA’s Project Spark , an AI-native event development tool that includes the new Destinaitor destination sourcing platform. DMO leadership and sales teams are exploring Spark to understand how clients are using new AI software to evaluate, compare and source destinations for business events. Others, like Kara Franker mentioned above, are looking for new AI solutions to optimize their HR and accounting departments, but she said many of the available options presently are only enterprise grade. Something DMOs should really look at, and I’m not sure how/if many already are, but there is proven value in creating custom GPTs for sales teams. GPTs are like mini ChatGPTs designed for specific purposes that anyone with a ChatGPT Plus account can create. For example, a sales rep can build a knowledge base inside a GPT by uploading sales materials, examples of successful bids, product information, pricing, team members, case studies, testimonials and other data. The next step is to develop internal GPT instructions to direct what the GPT does and what it prioritizes. Following that, the rep can then chat with the GPT and ask it to create a customized bid for a potential client that pulls all relevant source materials from the knowledge base that best supports the pitch. I’m imagining the ability to create custom GPTs is going to soon be a standard and required capability for all sales teams. One of the earliest enterprise examples of this was Salesforce’s Einstein GPT, which has since morphed into Agentforce. We use them at Matador because of improved efficiency and quality. GPTs also provide a new option for creative brainstorming, which some salespeople appreciate who don't identify as being super creative. Increases in sales production can be clearly identified. However, there's increasing conversation about tracking success in other departments. When AI delivers clear improvements in efficiency and saves people significant time, how do you measure that? One concern is that people will then just work a six hour day versus eight hours. The common thinking is that organizations will need to adjust productivity benchmarks, but this is a messy conversation. I don’t know enough to comment on that yet, but I wanted to put a pin in it because it’s something we’ll all need to look at eventually as AI scales in the workforce. 4. How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? I was addressing Visit Denver’s Board a while back and one member suggested that DMOs won’t need websites soon because they’ll be replaced by a ChatGPT-like window. I’m surprised by how much this comes up. For one thing, DMOs will always need some kind of online knowledge base for AI search queries. If anything, that will require more content and more comprehensive product information because AI search thrives more than anything on data structure, clarity and specificity. That said, the web user interface will likely evolve considerably. Expect to hear a lot more about how DMOs are developing data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to optimize data structure for AI search. For further context, here's a Perplexity Pro response to the question: "Are tourism boards developing data lakes and warehouses to optimize their sites for AI search?" Weir suggested that this conversation about the future of websites is not unlike what we went through 15 years ago, when people were lamenting the death of DMO sites because social media was deemed by some as the new web. More important, he asserted, is seeing how AI search is evolving and being prepared to adapt strategy. “I think there is a push-pull here between how we lead and where customers are at,” said Weir. “We want to deliver more information through our AI assistant and AI search in general, but customers aren't really there yet. I don't know what the percentage is, but the majority of people are still using Google. They're still beginning an interaction on the web by entering search terms in Google the traditional way. At some point, that's going to flip, right? It's going to be a few percent more each month or quarter, whatever that is. But how far ahead of it do we get? And how do we calibrate? We can try to lead on this, but you know, we also have to stay in step with where our customers are too.” 5. How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? Chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI have dashboards that clearly identify what visitors are asking about in the destination. That helps inform content and product development strategy, and the data is valuable for community engagement. AI chat platforms also operate 24/7 in 50+ languages, which helps DMO influence in-destination travel and spending for a much wider audience than ever before. How to best capitalize on conversational AI, and ultimately conversational commerce, is an evolving topic because we’re still in the early days where travelers are learning they can search with large language models and trust them. ChatGPT has 400 million weekly users but ChatGPT only added full functioning search capability for all users a few months ago. Consumers are just beginning to understand that they can now “talk” to a city. To help accelerate understanding and adoption of AI chat among visitors, Port asserted that the onus is on DMOs to promote their AI chat robustly like any other channel. Weir did that recently by highlighting Destination Toronto’s GuideGeek-powered “6ix” chat platform on LinkedIn, asking, “Ever had a chat directly with a city?” Weir was specifically promoting the organization’s WhatsApp platform, where people can now have a highly personalized, iterative conversation directly with Destination Toronto via the GuideGeek AI integration. The same functionality exists with the other Meta platforms, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. A few hours after Weir's post I received a Slack message from our CTO Stefan Klopp wondering what was going on in Toronto. WhatsApp volume was spiking, he said, and he was asking if Toronto had sent out a press release promoting 6ix, or something. No, it was just a quick CEO social media post. Also, Tourism New Zealand just launched a new campaign in collaboration with “A Minecraft Movie” that integrates GuideGeek-powered prompt questions to trigger further engagement. So, those are just a couple examples of how DMO/NTOs can drive AI chat engagement. The question for Weir and Port though is about the types of questions people are asking in AI chat platforms. Presently, a lot of the chat conversations are more utilitarian, related to queries about hotels, restaurants, attractions, events, directions, etc. So as conversational AI adoption increases, will DMOs focus more on developing content that answers those basic types of questions, like what hotel, restaurant or attraction is highly rated, and how to get there. Or, should DMOs continue to focus mainly on developing what is generally perceived as more inspirational destination and experiential content? "The question then becomes about responding to inquiries versus the inspirational side," explained Port. "Like, all of these articles, all of this content that we serve up, that is not in response to a question per se. It's more packaged to inspire people. I think a lot of that's going to have to exist outside our environments, maybe, whether it's influencers, it's your earned media strategy, it's content partnerships, things like that. That's where I think the inspiration will exist. But we really have to move to being more of the informative one, on our website or whatever a website is. But it needs to be very specific in answering questions. We already see that on GuideGeek." Weir summed up, saying, "I think this ends up relating more to, again, that question of where the customers are. Are we putting ourselves in a position to answer their questions and deliver the information in the way they're looking for it, using AI and the data lake approach? Or, are we curators like we've always been, inspiring visitors with local experiences, or is the customer now the curator by virtue of how they're asking questions today?" Summary These five takeaways are aligned with the five big AI questions. AI adoption begins with talking to DMO staff to understand what the organization is working with. Love the idea about marrying structured and self-directed learning, and being intentional about that with staff. At some point, for AI adoption to scale and continually evolve on an ongoing basis, there needs to be AI leaders in any organization who pick up the torch and inspire their colleagues to lean into AI. Otherwise, things tend to plateau with the same people using the same AI models. AI policy is intended to encourage staff to innovate with AI as much as it's meant to protect organizations. AI is the death of "I don't know," so it can benefit all staff in all departments. That in itself is enough ROI to validate initial investments in AI. The tools can provide a foundation of knowledge and direction for problem solving and strategic planning exponentially better than traditional search. Some organizations, like Visit Greece who we work with, have phenomenal website data structure ideally optimized for AI search. Meanwhile, one CEO told me "Our website is a mess with outdated content and poor data structure. We need to rebuild from scratch with AI search top of mind." Chat is the new marketplace, and AI is eating the entire funnel including in-destination. Moreover, AI chat data provides DMO leaders with insights into what visitors are asking about. Although, I think as chat adoption scales mainstream, the conversations will evolve beyond asking for a good hotel or restaurant. Greg Oates

Why Small Steps With AI Create Big Wins for Tourism Organizations Sep 22 Written By Greg Oates Key Theme: How to Align Strategic Risk Management and Progressive AI Implementation The rush to transform everything with AI has dominated boardroom discussions since ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Yet the most successful organizations aren't pursuing wholesale AI overhauls. They're taking calculated, incremental steps that deliver real value while building capabilities for the future. MIT researchers interviewed senior managers at 21 large companies actively using generative AI. Their findings challenge the prevailing narrative about AI transformation. Companies are deliberately choosing "small t" transformations over risky, large-scale implementations. This approach works particularly well for tourism organizations where customer trust and regulatory compliance matter deeply. Tourism organizations face unique challenges with AI adoption. Customer data privacy concerns run high. Regulatory requirements vary across jurisdictions. Service quality directly impacts reputation. The research reveals that successful companies treat AI implementation like climbing a risk slope. They start with low-risk internal applications before moving to customer-facing solutions. This measured approach isn't about being timid. It's about being smart. Tourism CEOs can build organizational confidence, develop necessary skills, and demonstrate tangible value before tackling more complex implementations. Start With Universal Productivity Tools That Employees Already Want to Use The research uncovered a surprising reality. Employees were already using ChatGPT and other public AI tools without permission. Companies responded by providing secure, private versions of these tools. This grassroots adoption pattern offers tourism organizations a clear starting point. Consider how your marketing team writes destination descriptions. Your operations staff creates training materials. Your finance team prepares reports. These tasks consume hours of employee time across every department. Private AI instances from providers like ChatGPT or Claude eliminate security concerns while boosting productivity. McKinsey built a custom platform called Lilli that connects AI to 40 internal knowledge sources. The result? Seventy-five percent employee adoption in under a year. Time savings up to 30%. Substantially improved work quality. Tourism organizations don't need to build something this sophisticated initially. Even basic AI writing assistants can transform daily work. Microsoft Copilot integration takes this further. Employees can search across company documents instantly. They can pull content from emails, meeting transcripts, and presentations. One manager described it as having "a super search engine" for company information. Imagine your team finding that obscure policy document from three years ago in seconds rather than hours. The beauty of starting here? Minimal risk. Maximum adoption. Employees want these tools. They're probably already using consumer versions. Providing enterprise versions addresses security concerns while meeting existing demand. Your IT team maintains control. Your employees get productivity gains. Everyone wins. Some employees will still seek external tools for specific needs. One product manager uses Midjourney for quick visuals. Another uses voice-to-text tools for performance reviews. Accept this reality. Focus on providing core tools internally while establishing clear guidelines for external tool usage. Deploy AI for Specific Roles While Keeping Humans in Control Once basic AI tools gain traction, tourism organizations can target specific job functions. The key insight from the research? Maintain human oversight for quality control. This "human in the loop" approach reduces risk while capturing efficiency gains. Customer service represents an ideal starting point for tourism organizations. AI can help agents find information quickly. It can suggest responses in real time. It can analyze call patterns to identify coaching opportunities. MIT researchers found AI coaching tools increased call center productivity by 14% on average. New and low-skilled workers improved by 34%. Morgan Stanley equipped financial advisors with an AI assistant trained on over one million internal documents. The tool doesn't replace advisors. It helps them find information faster so they can focus on customer relationships. Tourism organizations can apply this same principle. Help your concierge staff access local recommendations instantly. Enable tour guides to answer obscure historical questions accurately. Support reservation agents with instant access to availability across properties. CarMax demonstrates another powerful application. The company uses AI to generate descriptions for over 5,000 car pages. Manual creation would take multiple humans 11 years. With AI, it takes hours. The 80% approval rate from editorial review proves quality doesn't suffer. Tourism organizations can apply this to property descriptions, tour summaries, and destination guides. Creative teams at Dentsu use AI throughout their workflow. From proposals to budgeting to ideation. The emerging technology director noted employees spend less time on mundane tasks. They create higher-quality content with less effort. Tourism marketing teams can similarly accelerate campaign development, social media content creation, and promotional material design. Finance departments traditionally resist new technology. Yet some organizations successfully use AI for audit reports, regulatory compliance, and fraud detection. Amazon's finance team reports employees shifted from repetitive tasks to critical thinking work. Tourism organizations can start with expense report processing or invoice matching before tackling complex financial analysis. Transform Customer Experiences Gradually With Clear Boundaries Customer-facing AI sits highest on the risk slope. Yet the potential rewards justify careful exploration. The research shows companies succeeding by setting clear boundaries and expanding gradually. Chatbots evolved from frustrating phone trees to sophisticated conversational agents. John Hancock's insurance chatbots handle common queries effectively. Human agents focus on complex issues. Starbucks, Domino's, and CVS expanded to voice interactions. Video interactions come next. Tourism organizations can start with FAQ chatbots on their websites. Add booking assistance once that works well. Expand to voice-based concierge services when ready. Personalization transforms online shopping experiences. Tapestry, parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, uses real-time language modifications. The conversational tone mimics in-store associates. Revenue increased at least 3%. Tourism organizations can personalize trip recommendations based on past bookings. Adjust website content for different traveler segments. Customize email campaigns for individual preferences. Software companies already embed AI throughout their products. Adobe users create and modify images effortlessly. Canva simplifies presentation creation. Lucidchart converts text descriptions into flowcharts. Tourism organizations benefit as their existing software vendors add AI features. Property management systems will suggest optimal pricing. Booking platforms will predict cancellation risks. Marketing tools will automate campaign optimization. The key? Start small. Test thoroughly. Expand gradually. A failed internal productivity tool frustrates employees. A failed customer-facing AI damages your brand. Move up the risk slope deliberately. Build Foundational Capabilities Before Attempting Major Transformations The research revealed an uncomfortable truth. Scaling AI from pilot to production is harder than expected. Data quality issues multiply. Edge cases appear more frequently. Integration challenges compound. Many organizations discovered they needed stronger foundations before pursuing ambitious AI projects. CarMax's chief information officer emphasized data quality. "Good data will give you good results from AI." Poor data produces unreliable outputs. Tourism organizations must audit their data systems. Customer records across multiple systems need reconciliation. Historical booking data requires cleaning. Property information needs standardization. Governance structures matter equally. Who approves AI projects? How do you measure success? What happens when AI makes mistakes? Establish these frameworks before scaling implementations. Small pilots can proceed without perfect governance. Enterprise deployments cannot. Capital One's chief scientist warned against the "gold-rush mentality." Thoughtful, responsible implementation beats rushed deployment. Build the scaffolding to bring everyone along. Tourism organizations should resist pressure to match competitors' AI announcements. Focus on sustainable progress over headlines. Management buy-in proves essential for larger projects. One technology company's AI efforts stagnated until the CEO personally championed them. Small wins build credibility for bigger investments. Document productivity gains from initial deployments. Share customer satisfaction improvements. Make the business case concrete before requesting major funding. Summary: Small Transformations Today Enable Big Transformations Tomorrow The research delivers a clear message for tourism CEOs. Successful AI implementation doesn't require revolutionary change. It requires evolutionary progress. Start with universal productivity tools that employees already want. Target specific roles with human oversight. Transform customer experiences within careful boundaries. Build foundational capabilities systematically. This approach particularly suits tourism organizations. Your business depends on human connections. Technology should enhance these connections, not replace them. Your customers value authentic experiences. AI should enable better experiences, not artificial ones. Your reputation takes years to build and moments to destroy. Measured AI deployment protects what you've built while enabling future growth. The companies studied aren't waiting for perfect AI solutions. They're using today's technology to solve real problems while preparing for tomorrow's possibilities. They're training employees, cleaning data, and establishing governance. When breakthrough AI capabilities arrive, they'll be ready to capitalize quickly. Tourism organizations can follow this same path. Deploy AI writing assistants next month. Add customer service chatbots next quarter. Enhance personalization next year. Each step builds on the last. Each success enables the next. Small transformations compound into competitive advantage. The AI transformation race isn't won by the fastest starter. It's won by consistent, strategic progress. Tourism CEOs who embrace "small t" transformation today position their organizations for "big T" transformation tomorrow. The journey starts with a single step up the risk slope. Greg Oates

How to Develop AI Strategy for Your Organization Oct 12 Written By Greg Oates The 2050 City AI Roadmap provides a high-level strategic framework for how DMOs and other organizations can capitalize on AI to optimize internal operations, resources and knowledge, and ultimately, drive partner revenue. DMOs have all kinds of strategic plans, master plans, business and marketing plans, etc. The 2050 City AI Roadmap outlines the process to develop your AI strategic plan. It defines the big picture outlook for AI as the future of commerce, and it proposes a methodology to help DMO leaders prioritize, organize and navigate how they go about integrating AI across their organization. Presently, we're rolling this out with Visit Mesa , Tourism Richmond in British Columbia, and The Florida Keys & Key West . The three CEOs for those organizations have all agreed to share takeaways and business outcomes with each others' teams to cross-pollinate learning and accelerate AI process integration. That spirit of knowledge sharing and co-learning for me is huge, because we as an industry are all pretty much flying blindly with AI from a macro perspective. Yes, we've come a long way in the last year. Every DMO CEO I talk to these days is now implementing various AI processes and seeing value. However, we're all kind of flying this plane while we're building it at the same time, and we don't really have a destination, or even due north, in mind. The 2050 City AI Roadmap was designed to identify where we're going with this emergent technology that's both incredibly powerful and often highly unpredictable. It also defines how high-end AI chat platforms, like Matador Network's GuideGeek AI , are the tip of the spear for agentic commerce. The following guidelines are based on experience in the workplace to deliver new value with AI for your team, board, industry partners and community stakeholders. Internal & External Direction Every decision related to AI strategy should first be defined through an internal or external lens. Your board members will typically view internal workplace optimization as tactical. Externally, AI integrations that are consumer-facing and revenue generating are usually perceived as more strategic. Internal Facing From an internal standpoint, the focus of the AI Roadmap is on optimizing operations to take advantage of an organization's aggregate of resources and knowledge. Imagine the totality of insights across every team member in terms of their expertise and networks in their communities. AI systems are designed to pool and capitalize on that, but only if an organization's knowledge base is structured intelligently. That means rebuilding your folder structures and files naming conventions so an AI can find everything. According to Slack, workers spend 41% of their time on menial tasks, including endless hours just looking for information. The overall losses related to productivity, quality of work and workplace, and physical/mental health are crazy. So let's start there with AI strategy to address our internal digital dumpster fire. External Facing Externally, from a marketing, sales and visitor/partner engagement perspective, AI strategy begins with integrating a robust AI chat platform like GuideGeek. DMOs have never really had proprietary information on who their visitors are. They have geo-location, credit card spend, event attendance data, etc., which show visitor behavior. But none of those really identify visitor motivations and mindsets indepth. With an AI chat platform, DMOs can now pull analytics showing what visitors are actually asking and what they want to know on an individual and aggregate basis. We launched our new GuideGeek V2 analytics dashboard this past week, which provides deeper, fuller insights into visitor psychographics. That data then informs all kinds of resource allocation decisions related to content development, AI SEO strategy, data analysis, product and destination development, community engagement, etc. CEO Roles AI is best defined as a new digital "co-intelligence" that can communicate, reason and create for the first time ever, versus just another new technology. We emphasize that AI is really a new environment for collaboration more than anything, just not solely among humans anymore. Learning AI is not like learning Photoshop. You can only "teach" AI up to a point, like trying to teach someone how to ride a bike. You can't teach a child how to stay on two wheels without falling in a classroom. He or she actually has to start pedaling, and eventually the child's mind and body basically have a conversation, so to speak, with the bike to grasp the fundamentals of moving forward successfully. Same with AI. The only way to learn AI is to use AI. Helping human teams embrace this new co-intelligence (and it's not like there's a choice) falls under the umbrella of change management. That's a CEO's wheelhouse. It will take more than a few years for many humans to reconcile their minds and values with this new relationship, and it falls on the CEO's shoulders to steward that reconciliation. Likewise, CEOs oversee AI governance, policy and privacy. I've shared before how AI governance should be viewed less like a car brake and more like a steering wheel to inform, direct and accelerate AI adoption and integration. Lastly, only CEOs can scale long-term AI benefits and business outcomes effectively. You can't really delegate this. AI efforts will plateau at times, some or many AI experimentations will fail, and there are always staff members who will drag their feet because they just don't like AI. DMO CEOs are chief people officers and it's on them to create the right culture for scaling AI platforms and processes effectively for everyone in their crews. Agentic AI This is where things get interesting. AI agents and agentic commerce might sound super confusing for many or most staff members. Lots of land mines to watch out for, sure, but even more reasons for us building a macro DMO AI strategic framework. One of the key objectives for the AI Roadmap is to elevate AI agents and agentic commerce as the two interrelated cornerstones for AI strategy, and explain why. Doing so shows the true big picture value of AI, and it drives home how we eventually need to move way beyond training people the basics of prompting. Yes, it's intimidating, but we introduce the labels and contexts relating to agentic AI early on in the process. That gets some people thinking bigger about AI, and it entices the AI champions in the group to start experimenting with agents. AI Agents (Internal) For internal AI strategy, leading DMOs are developing AI agents and automated workflows to address the aforementioned 41% of time that staff members spend on grunt work and trying to find information. They are proven, they work, and most of all, they deliver measurable ROI. We're working with outside contractors at Matador to develop and implement agents and automations for both ourselves internally and for DMO clients. We are already seeing success, and there's been a recent influx among our people asking for agents. It's an amazing thing to see when staff members start requesting new AI integrations like that, proactively. That's when you know your AI strategy is working at least on some level. Agentic Commerce (External) AI agents are also the foundation for agentic commerce. According to Mastercard , "Agentic commerce is a new form of online and mobile shopping, in which an AI agent 'closes the loop' or completes tasks for a user — such as searching for items, comparing options and making a purchase — with limited or no manual inputs needed from that user. For example, while chatting in a generative AI app, you could tell the AI agent, 'Book me a nonstop flight to London for under $600 next week — no red-eyes,' and the agent will review airlines, nearby airports and your loyalty memberships and payment card rewards to identify the best option, purchase it and then share it with you." Just like with AI agents, developing agentic commerce architecture covers a wide spectrum of sophistication and capabilities. Going back to the analogy of flying a plane while building it with no clear final destination in mind, agentic commerce is the point on the map where we want to land. With GuideGeek, we have Kayak, GetYourGuide, Skyscanner and other booking tools integrated into the platform with a click-through UX/UI. Looking ahead, we're working with one national tourism organization to bring some of their national partners' booking engines (air, hotel, tour op, etc.,) into the platform to eventually convert sales in-chat. Subscribe to Mastercard Signals to keep up-to-date on agentic commerce and access intelligence like this Mastercard Payments Trends Navigator report. Staff Training & AI Integration Training staff and implementing AI processes across all departments is really the meat of the 2050 City Roadmap. But none of that should proceed without DMO leadership embracing all the above, and communicating it clearly to all staff. Easier said than done, though. Leadership needs to continually communicate a high-level approach to AI strategy, because it won't really click for many staff (or leadership) at the beginning of this process. That, of course, needs to be married with all the practical training initiatives we're continuing to develop. We've already learned a ton with the present work we're doing training DMO teams. Here are a few very basic takeaways just to start explaining our process. There are obviously many more educational modules following these, ranging from predictive analytics to specific department AI training in areas like HR, finance and legal. Conduct an internal AI survey asking all staff to share their perceptions and usage of AI. Follow that up with small group interviews across the organization, and transcribe everything with an AI notetaker. We use Granola, but there are many others. Also, explain to staff that all meetings regarding AI will be recorded to create an internal knowledge base to identify opportunities, challenges and takeaways over time. Start training with a focus on just the paid/pro models of ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. Some staff feel confused with the sheer variety of available AI tools in front of them. We explain that, at the end of the day, the basics of using AI include an end user, an AI tool, and a knowledge base. Get people on board with that, and then show how most of the AI tools they have access to are similar in many ways. One of the fastest methods to advance AI understanding is showing staff how to create custom GPTs in ChatGPT. Some team members will pick up on these quickly and start integrating them into their workflows right away. These are the people who typically make up your internal AI taskforce. Explain and show how Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot are AI workhorses that connect with the majority of people's daily workflows. However, humans tend to think of those as just the next evolution of search engines. This is mental wiring that needs to be broken. Gemini and Copilot are great/good in some ways, but I've found that training staff on just those three native LLMs first (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) is more effective for seeing the light. Google NotebookLM has a lot of fans. I like to walk teams through it because it's a good way to reinforce what a knowledge base is, like we do with the custom GPTs. Also, the automated audio and video podcasts are crowd pleasers, especially with the new Join function where users can engage directly with the agentic podcast hosts. People don't seem to want to read anymore. This was a rude awakening for us when we first launched the AI Roadmap with a series of online training materials. We now know we need to deliver short video instruction if we want anyone to actually look at the educational content. People love Descript for AI-powered video creation. Once we started showing how to use Descript, we were pleasantly surprised to see how staff really leaned in. Teaching Descript provides a fun break early in the process because people can see pretty amazing results in minutes and wrap their minds around the process fairly easily. Ask all staff to share how they're using AI effectively and where they see AI failing them. Catalogue the case studies and share across the organization to accelerate learning, inspire a healthy sense of internal competition, and track learning over time. Staff members are also often wowed seeing AI agents in action. We use n8n to develop agents, where you can create a lot of basic automated workflows quickly. Once a few early adopters see how agents can take over some of their more tedious, time-consuming tasks, others will jump in. Feedback Loop & Funding/Board Support This line in the AI Roadmap is broken down into tactical internal optimization and more strategic, consumer-facing and revenue-generating sales, marketing and stakeholder engagement. I don't have a lot to share for this section and the following one because our focus to date has been mostly on the above phases. Feedback Loop The reason we record every engagement with AI Roadmap clients is to scale learning, so if one person learns something, everyone can benefit. That will be further multiplied when we starting sharing takeaways across DMOS, and eventually the industry as a whole. Visit Mesa, Tourism Richmond and Visit Florida Keys are eager to lead this initiative, and we plan to launch a new AI thought leadership framework collectively in 2026. Funding & Board Support The spark that led to developing the AI Roadmap happened almost a year ago when a board member for a large DMO told me that she viewed AI integration as merely a tactic. If this work can elevate AI in the minds of board members toward a more high-level strategic imperative, then we'll have achieved part of our mission. There's still some work to be done first though to collect more case studies showing direct AI business outcomes before we can make a more solid case for additional funding for AI integrations. AI Strategic Plan We've produced a mockup of what we think an AI Strategic Plan will eventually look like, but it's too early to show presently. For now, we've identified three overarching pillars, each with potential strategies, action items, timelines and targets. The KPIs are crucial, of course, for scaling AI strategy across the travel industry. Right now, we're thinking the three pillars might look like the following, although this is all up in the air right now: Optimize Internal Operations & Knowledge: The strategies include cleaning up internal folders/files to improve AI outcomes in general and develop AI agents specifically. A lot in here on training, experimentation, overall adoption, success measures, etc. Increase Partner Revenue with Agentic AI: Defining how DMOs develop AI agents to fuel agentic commerce is the big goal overall with the AI Roadmap. Initial strategies in this pillar begin with more low hanging fruit though, such as website redevelopment, optimizing for AI SEO, AI chat integration, etc. Expand Community Collaboration: We're seeing more DMOs take a leading role in AI education for their industry and community stakeholders. The 2050 City Roadmap is perfectly suited for informing how DMO leaders can facilitate community AI workshops and increase the organization's overall relevance and value. Greg Oates

Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Kara Franker , president and CEO of The Florida Keys & Key West tourism organization, was among the first DMO leaders to embrace AI platforms and processes in 2023 when she was chief executive at Visit Estes Park in Colorado. In May 2024, Franker published two papers on AI strategy and policy: From the Base of the Rocky Mountains to the World: A case study through Visit Estes Park’s journey into Generative AI solutions — and how your DMO can carve its own AI path Navigating AI and the Law in the Travel Industry: An Introduction to Legal Implications for DMOs The first paper highlights how Visit Estes Park integrated GuideGeek AI chat into their website and three Meta platforms: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The DMO also branded the chat Rocky Mountain Roamer to give it an identity and bit of personality. The second paper focused on AI policy and data privacy, security and compliance. Franker, who is an attorney, co-wrote that with Roxanne Steinhoff , also an attorney at Steinhoff Law, who leads the firm’s destination marketing and sports tourism practice. I caught up with Franker to see how her perspectives on AI strategy and policy are evolving almost a year later. Greg Oates: You've been leading AI strategy in tourism for almost two years beginning with your work at Visit Estes Park. However, there’s still a lack of AI training today specific for DMO CEOs, and many leaders are presently unsure how to proceed with AI. As a CEO, what’s your take on that? Kara Franker: I'm not surprised that there's a lack of training because there's just so much for everybody to wrap their heads around. I think some people are trying to watch and wait and see. My philosophy has been more of a fall-forward, fail-forward kind of approach. That's why I put the white papers out. Anybody could learn from what we had done, and do it better. You know, a case study is sometimes the best way to figure this stuff out, so that's why we did it. The second paper on AI policy was with Roxanne Steinhoff on the legal and ethical implications of AI. Because when I would go and speak in front of groups, those were always the big questions from the leadership. They don't know how far is too far once you open this can of worms. That's why we got together and started to put guardrails in place that we thought might make sense for people to study, just as a first stab at it. That all launched last summer, so I do think that there's a little bit of education out there but we could definitely use more. GO: What do DMOs need to know about AI policy at a very high level in terms of privacy and security? KF: Employee and client information should be kept private and not uploaded into any AI tools. That could be a big deal, thinking of all the different rules and regulations about collecting information, especially how it's more stringent in Europe than in the United States. That can cause potential problems if you're uploading, say, a client list that has personal cell phones, email addresses or other information that people just don't want out there. So, it's really more about information that's attached to a person. And then, is there competitive data that you don't necessarily want others to have? Possibly, but so much of what we do in the DMO space is public anyways so the lines for that are pretty blurry. I’m trying to imagine a scenario where a DMO is, like, basically hacking somebody else's information through AI. I can’t imagine that’s worth the time and effort, or even possible. GO: A few months ago we were discussing what AI tools might be available for DMO departments like HR and accounting to help with privacy, compliance, efficiency, etc. But everything available seems to be enterprise grade and out of reach for DMOs. So what’s the answer for scaling AI across an organization? KF: I think this is a huge need. I hired somebody from Cisco who’s my new VP of technology and partnerships. She's a total AI nerd like I am, and way more qualified to dive into all this. She and I have been looking at different options to put together, almost like little plugins. We really, really need this. For example, how do we take an AI solution from the legal world to analyze all our contracts so that we don't have to spend as many hours with attorneys, because we really just need a template, right? And then for HR, same thing. How do we organize all our employee files into a much more streamlined and effective system? And then there’s our policies. We're a nonprofit but everything we do is so heavily influenced by County government. We have so many compliance issues, so I want an AI to learn every single piece of County policies so we’re able to compare and contrast what we're doing with those policies. I haven't been able to find anything to help with these things. We've looked at a lot of different options but it's like what you're saying. They're these big enterprise pieces built for law firms or financial people, and they’re all really expensive. None of them fit the mold for improving different operations at a DMO. In my mind, the marketing side is covered, especially with GuideGeek, and there are so many great options now for everything involved with marketing. So I feel like that's been tackled and done really well. But for the operations, we need more. I mean, we’ve just got to keep digging deeper, I think. GO: When you and your technology person from Cisco figure all this out, will you share what you find with the rest of us? KF: Of course, always. GO: Backing up a bit, you were arguably the very first DMO CEO to lean into AI, at least in North America, when you were with Visit Estes Park. How did you convince your board that investing in AI was important at the time, and what were some of your processes with bringing along staff? KF: We were fortunate in the sense that the board was all in and the staff were all in. And I don't mean to make age a part of it, but the staff was a little on the young side and they were all very ambitious. Everybody wanted to try to figure it out. So we made the argument to the board, if we could figure out some of what AI could do, it would make the community stronger and they could take pieces of it back to their businesses. There wasn't really anybody who was against experimenting and trying it out. We made some mistakes along the way and we put that in the white paper. Also, when we first rolled out GuideGeek, which scrapes the website, we found a few holes in our content. There were particular board members who didn't have very robust information about their business, so they got a little bit mad, but not in a, like, burn it down way. It was more of, "Oh, okay, we have some work to do." So part of the AI process has to actually be community outreach. It can't just be about the technology. We have to talk to all our partners and get really robust information from them, so when the AI crawls the site it gets the best possible information about our partners. GO: One thing you did at Visit Estes Park was brand your GuideGeek AI as Rocky Mountain Roamer on your website and three Meta platforms. We use that as a case study a lot, and emphasize that a DMO should promote their AI just like any other channel, right? KF: Definitely. We knew we had to put money behind marketing the tool if we wanted people to interact with it. Traditionally with a DMO, one of your calls to action is to send people to the website. Our new call to action for a lot of our campaigns back then was to send people to the AI, so we called it Rocky Mountain Roamer to help promote and drive traffic to it. And then in terms of KPIs, we wanted to track all the interactions you can see in the backend, but not just how many people used it. We wanted to know how long people interacted with the AI, what their journey was, and what they were asking about because that’s where things get really interesting. GO: After the initial thrill of launching GuideGeek, how did you manage how staff used AI internally? Were there any incentives involved to help spur adoption and experimentation? KF: The incentive for my team was, well, it wasn't really an incentive. It was a requirement. They had to write weekly reports for me about how they tested something with AI, whatever it was. It could apply to their job or not, I didn't really care. So I almost forced them to try AI. But then people started really getting into it. They were getting more and more user friendly with different AI tools, and they would be like, “Oh, I like Anthropic because of this or that,” because they were branching out from just using ChatGPT. So, yeah, there has to be almost like a culture of AI in your DMO for it to really work, and it's on the CEO to create and foster that. Greg Oates

Join Matador Network's AI Playground at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Matador Network, GuideGeek AI and U.S. Travel are launching the inaugural "AI Playground" at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix, August 17-19. The educational space, hands-on demo area, genius bar and live sessions will run all three days during the conference. We are also producing programming specific for travel industry CEOs, along with other sessions dedicated for senior executives, highlighting actionable AI strategies focusing on real world business outcomes. Leading up to ESTO, I'll be reaching out to many of you requesting any AI-related success stories and/or questions you might have for the AI Playground. Looking back over the last two years, it's clear the industry is turning a corner in 2025 when it comes to AI learning and adoption. Many DMOs and their industry partners are now integrating AI processes and platforms across their organizations, whereas last year many destination leaders were still in wait-and-see mode. For those of you still on the fringes, it is our ambition that the AI Playground will plant a flag in the ground showing how AI is now a proven strategy for helping DMOs further deliver on their mandate. "AI is clearly powering the future of travel and how people explore the world today," says Ross Borden, founder and CEO of Matador Network. "We are stoked to be working with U.S. Travel and investing in our industry to produce the AI Playground. AI will become standard operating procedure for every DMO soon, and we're excited to help lead this journey." DMO CEOs on AI Strategy Matador launched its proprietary GuideGeek AI chat platform for DMO websites and social media channels almost two years ago. We now have more than 40 DMOs onboard, and we're expanding the scope of GuideGeek AI with new hotel groups and tour operators joing in recent months. Based on our experience working with municipal, regional and national organizations across the global visitor industry, we have unparalleled insights into how conversational AI is changing the relationship between destinations and visitors, as well as how DMOs operate internally. In preparation for ESTO 2025, we launched this GuideGeek Destination AI newsletter in January to ramp up our industry outreach and further expand our understanding of how DMO leaders are navigating the rise of AI. Here are five stories from the newsletter that inform high-level decision making related to AI strategy, with input from more than 15 CEO DMOs: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI : Our first post with 12 DMO CEOs highlighted the wide range of questions they have. One asked for the five big AI questions he should know about. Another wants practical advice on five AI initiatives that he can implement, like, tomorrow. Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism : CEO Royce Chwin, who helms Destination Vancouver, shared why his organization was one of the first DMOs in the world to dive into AI. Destination Toronto & Visit Denver CEOs on the 5 Big AI Questions in Tourism : Two chief executives, Andrew Weir in Toronto and Richard Scharf in Denver, worked out what they believe are the five big AI themes/questions that DMOs need to focus on, as touched on in the first post. Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation : Newly installed Florida Keys CEO Kara Franker, who is also an attorney, shed light on AI policy, compliance and the need for more non-enterprise AI solutions for her organization. Visit Mesa CEO Launches New DMO AI Road Map : Another visionary DMO chief executive, Visit Mesa leader Marc Garcia is bringing a new level of structure and direction for integrating AI processes and platforms. Next up, Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau, will be discussing AI strategy from a business events perspective. I also met with Cody Chomiak, vice president of marketing at Travel Manitoba, who's really lighting a fire in Canada around AI thought leadership and adoption. He'll be sharing a few powerful AI case studies from his provincial marketing organization, both internal and visitor-facing. AI Playground at ESTO 2025 The AI Playground this year will feature three stations at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge . We will have our Matador GuideGeek team and U.S. Travel staff on hand to guide participants through the space, along with some invited AI experts from around the industry. We'll be digging into a handful of paid AI models including ChatGPT Plus/Teams, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro, Google AI Pro, Microsoft Copilot Pro and Manus. We'll show how AI is best navigated at DMOs by bucketing strategy into three unique categories: Search, Create and Sales. Specific use cases will include content generation and data analysis, AI SEO and AI-optimized web development, AI policy and governance, staff adoption, building custom GPTs for sales proposals, and automated workflows and AI agents, among others. The three stations are: The Prompt Lab welcomes all attendees to come in and test drive various AI models. The interactive, hands-on learning station will have multiple laptops for experimenting with AI tools for people of all skill levels. We'll have a bunch of paid AI models pre-loaded for live demos and one-on-one conversations showing how AI actually works and some of what it accomplishes across different departments. Feel free to bring your own laptop if you like. The Genius Bar is designed for individual and group Q&A about real world AI strategy, implementation and ROI. We'll be collecting all the questions posed to share with the broader industry afterward, so we'll have a couple crowdsourcing boards to help generate new ideas and explore new solutions. Reach out to me if you want to schedule time to talk during ESTO. The AI Theater seating area will host a range of AI-focused dialogues, micro-presentations and a few dedicated sessions designed for CEOs, as well as other senior executives. The programming schedule for all those will engagements be included in the ESTO agenda. Most importantly, all the conversations at the AI Playground will highlight tangible AI case studies and specific business outcomes. The 5 Big Questions About AI One of the best things to come out of all the interviews with DMO CEOs this year is our list of the five big AI questions that chief executives need to focus on. These questions will likely evolve a bit, but for now they're providing direction for how we're developing the AI Playground and how DMOs are moving forward with AI integration. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? I would love to hear your feedback on any the above and how we can make the ESTO 2025 AI Playground as valuable as possible for you and your teams. Reach out at greg@matadornetwork.com . Greg Oates

Visit Mesa CEO Launches New AI Roadmap Aug 25 Written By Greg Oates Visit Mesa in Arizona kicked off a new internal initiative this week to integrate AI processes and platforms across the organization. I worked with Visit Mesa to help develop their new DMO AI Roadmap, which provides a 5-phase strategic framework that most any visitor organization can use as a template. The project officially began this week during Visit Mesa’s spring board meeting to communicate why the organization is moving forward with AI to optimize the DMO’s value for Mesa’s visitor industry and the local community. Marc Garcia, CATP , president and CEO of Visit Mesa, has been eager to start this initiative. He was one of the dozen CEOs who contributed to the first GuideGeek Destination AI story a few months back, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI. For that deep dive into a CEO's mindset regarding AI, Garcia asked: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” The Visit Mesa DMO AI Roadmap answers those questions. “I've recognized that AI is extremely important not only for the world moving forward, but specifically for our industry,” Garcia explained at the beginning of this project. “We at Visit Mesa need to get out in front of it. Even as a small to medium-sized DMO with our budget, we've always taken pride in the fact that we’re typically at the forefront of the latest and greatest in terms of technology, and so this is just an extension of that.” The following is a high-level overview of the DMO AI Roadmap and each of the five phases. However, like all strategic planning, there is a big jump between developing a plan and executing it effectively. This is especially true with internal AI training. In any given organization today, there is often a wide breadth of how people perceive AI and how proficient they are with AI models. It will take time to educate and align everyone around shared benefits for the organizations and staff, expected processes, intended outcomes and success metrics. Visit Mesa AI Roadmap The DMO AI Roadmap is a structured, phased approach for educating staff and integrating AI across DMO departments. The goals for the roadmap are to optimize internal operations, enhance sales and marketing outcomes, inspire staff self-learning, future-proof the organization, and contribute to how well local industry and community leaders adopt AI best practices and benefit from them. There are two imperatives that should be established and agreed upon among leadership at the very beginning. Integrating AI processes and platforms is an imperative for the DMO to ensure its relevancy and long-term impact in the local visitor economy. If leadership doesn’t fully believe that, this strategic framework won’t work. AI proficiency is an imperative for staff members for their future growth and marketability. That said, you can’t really force people to embrace, learn and use AI intentionally, but the job market will. The following phases are highly fluid and some of the processes can be rolled out concurrently. Ultimately, these phases provide structure for effectively and responsibly implementing a new technology that has no precedent. Because of generative AI, machines can now do three things they haven’t been able to do before. They have the ability to reason, the ability to communicate, and the ability to generate stuff based on that reasoning and communication. Meaning, AI is messy. Integrating it into our daily workflows is also messy because it's challenging us to rethink our relationship with technology. But as Kate Yordi, director of marketing at Visit Mesa, said during the board meeting this week, “Finally, we have some direction.” Phase 1: Leadership Alignment & Staff Communication As discussed at length in previous Destination AI posts, the DMO CEO must make it clear to all staff that the organization prioritizes AI because the organization prioritizes being relevant. It certainly helps, as is the case with Visit Mesa, when the CEO is fully backed by the board to invest in AI integration. During the board meeting, one member asked, “What do you need from us, Marc?” That’s a good sign. For the DMO AI Roadmap to work, all leadership needs to not only have a basic understanding of AI tools, they need to actually use them as well on a regular basis. That goes a long way in driving agency across the organization. However, making that happen typically requires some C-suite training to explain the primary AI models more indepth: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot and/or Google Gemini depending on the specific workplace platform(s) the organization uses. Identifying and prioritizing just a handful of AI models like that brings a lot of clarity to the process right off the bat. You see people's shoulders relax when they're confronted with 5-6 AIs versus dozens. (Yes, VEED, Gamma, Manus, Sora, Granola, Slack AI, etc., are all really cool but let's not start there.) A common lament among DMO leadership related to AI is, “Where do we even start?” Leadership should then discuss and begin to answer the five big questions all CEOs face when navigating AI integration, as vetted in the aforementioned Destination AI post about what CEOs want regarding AI education: How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI (who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI) to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and quality of work? How do we redevelop our content and channels to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI for business purposes to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The next step in this phase, at a basic level, is communicating to staff why they’re being asked to embrace AI. The following is not meant to be comprehensive, but a CEO would likely want to articulate: The purpose of the AI Roadmap, guiding principles, and the phases and processes involved How AI integration will take time and people will evolve at different paces It’s ok if everyone feels like they’re building the plane while flying it Everyone is encouraged to use AI and will be supported, but there will also be guardrails in place AI adoption and use cases will become part of employee reviews, but traditional roles, responsibilities and key success metrics are still the priority "How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents." — Marc Garcia, president and CEO, Visit Mesa Phase 2: Staff Assessment & AI Task Force Sitting down and asking staff how they feel about AI and how/if they’re using it is a good way to begin. Depending on the size of the organization, this can be done with every staff member individually or a representative group from each department. Generally people fall into three camps when it comes to AI: 1) Those who are already using AI on a regular basis; 2) those who are curious and have experimented a bit, but they don’t actively engage with AI tools; and 3) those who don’t see much value in AI. This last group can also include people who outright oppose AI, but they make themselves apparent pretty quickly. Data also shows there is often a significant percentage of staff who use AI in secret because they’re not sure they’re allowed to use it for work purposes. The second way to collect staff sentiment and AI capacity is with a blind online survey asking everyone what they like about AI, what concerns them, how they feel about job security, what they want to learn, what they hope to achieve, etc. Everything is anonymous so you can expect a wide variety of feedback ranging from constructive/optimistic to fears of an impending robot apocalypse. Once complete, all the data should be synthesized into key takeaways for leadership and shared with staff to show a high level of transparency right from the beginning of this process. The second part of this phase is developing an AI task force. The value of this cannot be overemphasized. Choose a small group of AI champions from various departments to do three things: Provide direction for stewarding the various processes in each phase as effectively as possible from beginning to end Share constructive and thoughtful input they’re hearing from other staff members about how things are proceeding well and where there are challenges Help scale AI adoption across teams by showing how they’re using AI effectively to everyone else in the organization An internal AI task force or council is invaluable because the members are motivated and they want to learn. Mostly, their enthusiasm and success with AI will begin to rub off on many of their colleagues and inspire self-learning and greater adoption among the teams. But not all. There will be those who disengage, and there can be a significant number of them. Over time, they should be consulted to understand their trepidation, which should then be addressed. This is a challenge I'm having with one organization where a significant cohort are saying they're too busy to learn AI. Meanwhile, the majority of the staff are reporting daily usage with effective results, which definitely wasn't the case a few months ago. And even with those leaning in, the level of improvement and AI Iearning will be slow at times. This is why it’s critical for the CEO and the rest of management to be all-in and consistently participate in staff training sessions to show direction, intention and support. It’s very easy for the novelty of AI training to wear off after the first few months. This is where the AI task force can be instrumental to help maintain overall staff interest and keep engagement levels as high as possible. "Finally, we have some direction." — Kate Yordi, director of marketing, Visit Mesa Phase 3: AI Policy & Investments Developing an official AI policy and governance manual accomplishes two primary objectives: It protects the organization against legal and financial liability by establishing how all employees are required to use AI responsibly. It encourages and gives license for staff to proactively experiment with AI because there are clear guidelines in place about how to do so. There are many DMOs who have created AI policies and are willing to share with the rest of the industry. These are typically not lengthy documents (3-4 pages) nor full of legalese. Generally they’re written so every single employee can understand everything in them. Sections in these policies often include: Positioning/Purpose Statement: Expresses how and why the organization needs to be intentional about implementing AI processes Primary Objectives and Intended Outcomes: Defines the business case for how the organization is attempting to deliver on its core mandate of driving revenue to local businesses in alignment with community priorities Guiding Principles: Establishes the principles of responsible AI use in alignment with the values of the organizations related to themes such as inclusivity, bias, authenticity, veracity, collaboration, knowledge sharing, etc. AI Definitions: Provides clear explanations of AI terminology used in the document and workplace AI Tools: Identifies specific AI models that the organization provides access to Data Input: Dictates clear rules about what employees can upload into AI models and what they can’t upload, such as personal information of any person Monitoring: Defines how the organization reserves the right to monitor AI practices Training & Support: Defines opportunities for professional growth and learning AI on an ongoing basis There are other items that DMOs might include in the above list, and they vary depending on how HR, financial and legal departments interpret AI governance, but it serves as a foundation. One key consideration for DMO leadership when it comes to policy is identifying which pro AI models to invest in. Paid AI tools provide higher levels of privacy and security because AI companies don’t train on them, or at least there’s the choice to select that option. Many DMOs, for example, purchase annual subscriptions for paid ChatGPT Team accounts ($25 per employee monthly) for staff to use for work, which is a first step for protecting the IP and other interests of the organization. Other paid AI models are then provided to specific departments based on need and the specific attributes of the tools, such as Claude for marketing and social media staff because many consider it the best AI for content creation. Phase 4: AI Education & Implementation This is the most important thing in training teams to embrace and use AI effectively. You want to foster an environment where structured learning evolves into self-learning. That’s the only way this scales. When staff members with little experience in AI start exploring how to use AI on their own, and they start helping their colleagues see new ways to use AI, that’s a pretty special thing. From an education standpoint, the DMO AI Roadmap begins at a high level defining AI’s place in online history. AI is the third transformational shift since the PC was invented, including: The mainstream web/internet in the 1990s; the evolution of mobile/social/cloud and apps in the 2000s; and gen AI in the 2020s. These are the only three times when big tech went all-in and pivoted their business models around a new technology. I then break AI training into the following buckets, and again, this is all very surface level and not meant to be comprehensive. Also, creating engaging demos are everything, and that's not also easy because AI demos can be a real slog sometimes. But, showing how different AIs provide real value is key for people to internalize their learning and use it more intuitively over time: Explain how pre-gen AI tech is deterministic and gen AI is probabilistic, which messes with a lot of people’s minds. Gen AI outputs are based on statistical patterns and probabilities, just like the human brain processes ideas and information. Traditional tech is based on absolutes, delivering the same output based on the same input. Old tech is about information. AI is about knowledge. Spend a lot of time on this with workshops and demos. Highlight the capabilities of only three AI models to start: ChatGPT for brainstorming and planning; Claude for writing and data analysis; and Perplexity for conversational search. The other two, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, are more general purpose. They also do amazing things (Gemini 2.5 Pro is great for reasoning), but focusing on the first three will provide direction at the beginning so people don’t get overwhelmed. At the very minimum, leadership should have a basic understanding of those three. Explain how AI search isn't 100% perfect but it's a 1,000% better than old search. Define how DMOs and all brnads are redesigning their websites and content strategy to optimize for AI search, and the basics of AI SEO . I would argue the most important thing for using AI is really understanding how generative AI = conversational AI. It's a dialogue. It's called "chat" for a reason. This is where I’ve heard the most positive feedback from teams I’ve worked with. It happens when people move beyond the Google mindset—where search is one and done—and they see the real value of iterative conversations with AI models that evolve with each exchange in the discussion, just like a human conversation. This also removes some misperceptions about how to prompt. Yes, there are some basic rules about how to prompt well. But beyond that, it’s vastly more beneficial to explore AI conversations further with thoughtful follow-up prompts that flow logically and organically to achieve the best results. Explore how the real value of AI extends beyond just efficiency and productivity gains. That's a dangerous dialogue with staff who can construe that as leading to more work or being terminated over time. The bigger value and better narrative is how AI increases creativity and knowledge, and how those both influence overall quality of work, marketing effectiveness, sales productivity, staff culture and pride, job satisfaction and growth opportunities, etc. Really dig into the advanced features of the paid models: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro. Aside from the added security and privacy they provide, they offer functions not available in the free models and their outputs are significantly better. ChatGPT Projects and custom GPTs, Claude Projects and Perplexity Spaces are where the magic happens. Create an environment where staff members are eager to share their successes with AI with the rest of the organization. This feedback loop is critical for steering education and driving adoption, and it’s one of the most important roles for the internal AI task force. AI-training meetings can be highly effective during video calls but they often have the greatest impact during in-person workshops. Also, make sure to give staff a specific amount of hours during the week to develop their AI skills. Explore options for AI chat platforms and the benefits they provide for visitors and local industry partners. I work with Matador Network, which developed the industry leading GuideGeek AI chat platform. The feedback from 35+ DMO clients is impressive and irrefutable, but there is still much work to do educating visitors and industry about AI chat strategy and their benefits to continually increase adoption and business outcomes. The DMO AI Roadmap also provides guidance for developing various learning and engagement formats: Schedule weekly or bi-weekly meetings specifically, and only, for AI training with both internal and external people sharing insights Create a library of AI educational materials for staff to reference Start a weekly internal AI newsletter to share how teams are using AI Start a Slack or similar channel dedicated for AI education, AI news updates, knowledge sharing, etc Start a weekly and optional one-hour AMA meeting for everyone to ask everyone else questions (highly effective) Create a regular schedule for staff to report back to leadership or department heads about how they’re using AI and what they’re achieving with it Phase 5: Success Tracking I kick off every AI presentation identifying the three AI models mentioned above—ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity—followed by the assertion that, "AI is the death of 'I don't know.'" That is arguably the biggest ROI for integrating AI in a DMO or any other type of organization. There are few questions that are too complex or too intimidating for DMO staff to approach with confidence and conviction if they know how to use those three AI models effectively. I shared an example previously where I used Perplexity Pro to educate myself about how board governance is evolving . That for me was something I knew was out of my realm of expertise, but now I feel I can speak with some semblance of authority about that to any board because of AI. Before gen AI, I dismissed board governance as one of those things I'd just have to leave in the dark. That said, trying to explain how AI helps staff become more self-reliant, where they can always build a foundation of understanding for anything to empower themselves, only goes so far with a board. They're looking for more quantitative KPIs. Here are just some examples of that in a DMO context. In 2025, defining KPIs for AI integration is an evolving science, and we as an industry are still figuring a lot of this out. Therefore, this list is nowhere near comprehensive and it will evolve, but we have ample data today to validate the following: Using AI for search and content development saves significant time and increases opportunities for higher output and increased creativity for producing blog posts, social media, videos, marketing campaigns, etc. Developing custom GPTs (in ChatGPT Plus) for group sales is a proven strategy for creating better, more customized proposals in much less time. That gives sales staff more time for brainstorming and prospecting leading to higher production. That's a fact. In this case, group sales people are actually pumped to try a new technology. Using AI for regression analysis and scenario modeling increases the accuracy of how DMOs predict visitor volumes year-round, event attendance, economic impact, etc. One of the biggest conversations in DMOs today is how to develop content and websites to rank higher in AI search. Developing best practices in AI SEO leads to higher traffic. That is a core mandate for any DMO, and no DMO can afford to ignore that over time. AI chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI are driving real business. As described in PhocusWire in March, New York City Tourism + Conventions launched its GuideGeek-powered "Ellis" meeting-specific AI chat in January. ROI to date: 100% increase in traffic to the meeting planner website, 800+ AI-driven queries in the first month, 50% growth in newsletter sign-ups, and 10% increase in time spent on the site. Summary The AI train has left the station and it's gaining steam. The DMO AI Roadmap is the next logical step for helping DMO CEOs and their teams integrate AI processes and platforms. As Visit Mesa's Kate Yordi said, "Finally, we now have direction." That's a big deal for DMO staff to feel that way. Generative AI has been with us for more than two years now, but a structured and phased approach for integrating AI across DMO departments has been the missing piece. Visit Mesa's DMO AI Roadmap is going to evolve as the team works through the process, but at least now there's a vision and scope. Visit Mesa CEO Marc Garcia and the board are fully committed—a critical first step for embarking on this journey. Also, this strategic framework for how DMOs approach AI is going to underpin the interactive AI Playground activation at U.S. Travel's upcoming ESTO conference in Phoenix, August 17-19. U.S. Travel and GuideGeek are partnering to develop educational programming for the hands-on AI training experience and series of thought leadership. Greg Oates

How AI Improves DMO and Community Master Planning Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Many DMOs are developing 10-year destination master plans to optimize their visitor economy in alignment with local community priorities. I've participated in producing dozens of them from Miami to Mesa. They often take as long as a year to complete because there's so much focus on community engagement in various formats: interviews, focus groups, town halls, surveys, visioning sessions, etc. The tourism industry talks about the importance of community a LOT. However, when you're working with a DMO, you never really dig into what actually moves the needle across so many endless community demands, not on a tactical and hyperlocal level. You're not really held accountable for any measure of success when it comes to community-specific initiatives, ranging from improving City Hall permitting processes for small businesses to tracking the movement of unhoused. A master plan needs to address those and amplify those kinds of pressing needs for the destination overall. The expectation is not really to fix them. That’s not the role of a DMO. It's a whole different ballgame when you're developing a long-term strategic framework for a community organization like Near Southside, Inc . in Fort Worth. Success and being accountable for fixing things is expected. Located at the periphery of the downtown core, Near Southside is the most interesting community in North America right now. The ex-industrial district can be loosely compared to Austin 20 years ago with the same cultural DNA and similar community values, based on a fiercely protective love for local, creative and independently owned small businesses. That's under threat. In the last few years, as Near Southside evolved into the coolest 'hood east and west of the Pecos Line, real estate prices are rising commensurately. We all know how this story often ends with the encroachment of national brands sanitizing the soul of a place that made it attractive in the first place. Near Southside is intent on rewriting that story. AI Processes for Strategic Planning Here's where AI comes in. Because of the multitude of overlapping challenges and evolving dynamics in the community, our team needs to crunch and debate a ton of qualitative and quantitative data. Addressing gentrification touches on so many aspects of how communities operate. Therefore, we are over-indexing on community engagement to get as many perspectives as possible to identify how the community best evolves in the face of rapid change. The amount of inputs we're getting is substantive, and we want to inventory all of it as thoroughly as possible to build a super comprehensive knowledge base for the AI to cull through, connect dots and output insights. Every individual zoom call with stakeholders is recorded with Granola AI, which produces full transcripts but the summaries are too light. So we created custom GPTs with instructions for everything we want in the summaries, including comprehensive overviews, key takeaways with detailed context for each, the most insightful quotes related to those takeaways, and all action items that stakeholders recommended. With the GPT, we can fire full transcripts into the chat, press "enter" and receive highly valuable, high quality and uniform summaries almost immediately. We're doing the same with the focus groups but the custom GPTs require a different set of instructions. The two-hour transcripts capture the conversations with 10-20 stakeholders convened across specific industry and community segments. For those, the GPTs bucket corresponding high-level takeaways and tactical action items related to the same theme. That has immeasurable value because these conversations are all over the place. It's great working with locals who are so passionate about where they live and how, but that means you're getting feedback from a firehose and someone taking notes doesn’t capture all the nuance. Using custom GPTs to produce these summaries and populate takeaways is as good or better than any team could do manually. Everything is stored in Airtable. Forget Google or Microsoft cloud platforms. Airtable is an AI-powered, relational database/spreadsheet beast for organizing data and automating basic workflows. The tables combine all project information in one place, such as a running list of pending/completed interviews and focus groups and their AI-generated summaries. Airtable can then auto-generate a summary of the summary in the same table for clients to easily review everything being collected on a daily basis to whatever degree they prefer. Once you use Airtable, you'll never look at Google Drive the same way again. I've never had so many insights so well organized, so thorough and so easy to share with a team and client to help inform each project phase. The client loves the transparency, immediacy and structure, naturally, versus waiting for the next weekly update to read a few bullet points in a PowerPoint. Here's the thing. Because we've been so intentional about collecting such a high quality and comprehensive volume of feedback, we have a motherlode of a knowledge base for AI to work with. We can then enter all that in bulk into Google NotebookLM or ChatGPT/Claude Projects to pull out anything from high-level aggregate takeaways to anything super customized or tactical. For example, the client was interested in hearing specifically just what developers had to say about gentrification. I wanted highlights related to anything discussed regarding City Hall processes. It’s super easy to pull reports together for those and anything else. Ultimately, you can use AI to deliver an outline, a strategy map and a very rough draft of a destination master plan. All you need to do is combine all of the above together, plus PDFs of all relevant public and private planning documents, PDFs of all relevant case studies and best practices, and detailed instructions about the purpose, elements, structure, etc., of the plan. People will disagree, sure. I'm not dismissing the expertise of people who put these things together, because they bring deep context to every conversation and decision made during the development of a master plan. Everything happening now in Near Southside has happened somewhere else. When you can bring takeaways from those places to any present situation, it helps provide direction for everyone in the room. Again, I’m not saying that AI is replacing humans. People get all kinds of worked up over that, especially in travel and tourism. I am saying you can create a better, more strategic and more informed master plan in a much more streamlined fashion when you employ AI strategically to better prepare a community for the future. That's just a fact. I have four more community focus groups today in Near Southside. The expectation among everyone is that their contributions will make a demonstrable difference in their neighborhood. We can’t just speak to the challenges. We need to fix them and our processes with AI are giving everyone more confidence that we can deliver on that. Wondering how many DMOs are interested in employing similar AI-first strategies to get a better handle on how to help their communities. Greg Oates

How Visit Richmond is Using AI to Sell More Conventions Aug 2 Written By Greg Oates DMO CEOs want specific use cases for AI showing how they drive measurable business results. Here's a great example for capitalizing on AI to drive meetings and conventions volume from Lauran Peoples , director of sales marketing and business development at Visit Richmond in Virginia. Peoples works in the organization's 13-person sales team and reports to the VP of sales. Her role has three core functions: She is the main liaison between the destination sales and marketing departments; she develops and leads campaign strategy for the sales department; and she works with her colleagues to optimize strategic partnerships. Peoples' role is somewhat unique as a liaison between sales and marketing in that she lives on the sales side, versus marketing. She also stands out in our industry as an emerging voice in AI innovation. If you're going to U.S. Travel's ESTO conference this month in Phoenix, look for her and me working in the show's inaugural AI Playground educational activation. Greg Oates: Can you explain your role at Visit Richmond, specifically in terms of how you bridge the sales and marketing teams? Lauran Peoples: It's becoming more common in DMOs for sales teams to have a marketing liaison, but usually that person is based on the marketing team and is mostly assigned to sales to help with creative. The issue is when that marketing liaison is based on the marketing team, they don't have much exposure to the field and what's happening out of market with your salespeople. Our sales team has 45 trade shows this upcoming fiscal year, so they're traveling almost every week. With my situation in Richmond, they're getting real-time data and downloads about what's happening in each destination, so that gives them more authentic conversations to engage planners. Not having someone assigned to a team like that creates a huge disconnect and leaves opportunity on the table. GO: Tell us a little about your journey with AI. LP: I've been working in hospitality for 20 years. Last year, I heard some younger people on the team talking about ChatGPT. So I was like, okay, I don't know anything about that. I went to PCMA Convening Leaders in January and the opening session was all about AI. I remember sitting there feeling like a dinosaur. Feeling very behind. I realized this is a lot more serious and widespread than I thought, so I left and tasked myself with using ChatGPT once a day. Initially, I couldn't differentiate how it wasn't like Google. I was asking it how many tablespoons are in this or that, kind of thing. Since then, my understanding of AI has progressively increased around more complex and comprehensive capabilities. It has streamlined my productivity, but more importantly, AI has become a thought partner for me to bounce all these ideas and scenarios around that I didn't have before. I think that a lot of people are adopting AI and using it as a communications assistant, or a writing assistant. But the part for me that's really exciting and valuable with AI is analyzing and aggregating data and getting it to show you things that you need help with, like sales. GO: Can you share an example? LP: Sure. I took five datasets: five years of lost business, five years of definite business, and three marketing reports from different campaigns we were running with outside agencies like Sojourn and Digital Edge. Those campaigns give us demographic insights because we were targeting certain areas. I also grabbed our sales deployment sheet, which tells you who has what market. I uploaded all of those into ChatGPT and asked it to identify the top five locations for each of our managers based on their market segments. Some results weren't surprising, but there were a few that popped up like Orlando that we've never traditionally considered. When I asked ChatGPT why Orlando, it showed how the city has a large hobby market. It turns out there are a lot of hobby conventions that meet in Orlando. After I compiled the top five locations for each manager, I asked ChatGPT to give me the top five accounts in each of those locations. Then I asked for unique selling propositions for each of those accounts as to why Richmond would be a perfect fit. Finally, I asked it to rank those five destinations based on probability of success. GO: Have you seen any of this result in new business opportunities? LP: Yes. One location that showed up was Philadelphia. Richmond is four hours from Philadelphia, but like Orlando it hasn't typically been on our radar. However, based on the data from ChatGPT, Philly came up as a recommendation. So we sent one of our sales managers to Philadelphia, and she ended up hosting 18 planners, including some who drove from over an hour away to see her. She got such a great response that I had to jump in and go with her because she couldn't host 18 clients by herself. AI has now informed our sales strategy for Philly, and the region is now part of our dedicated sales strategy. We've allocated funds for that sales manager in Philly to join chapters of organizations like MPI and PCMA. So that's how we know there had to be some accuracy to our approach with AI. GO: How do the sales managers feel about you doing this AI analysis? LP: They appreciate it. It's a balance because most sales managers at DMOs aren't entry level; they've been in hospitality for a long time. This is a new process and a new tool for them. Some have destinations they like to go to over and over because they're successful there. But my role is to support business enablement and sales enablement to help them do what they do better and uncover new business. So how we're using AI provides them with additional actionable research. GO: I think one of the most underrated strategies for AI is developing custom GPTs in ChatGPT to help sales teams develop more customized and effective proposals more quickly. Are you building those at all? LP: Yes, definitely. About a month and a half ago, I programmed a GPT for the sales team called "Prospecting Partner." It's trained on our sales collateral and all our information, so it knows our convention packages and understands our jurisdiction and seven localities. The sales managers have been using it to prospect smarter. I included suggested prompts to go beyond just, "Give me a prospecting email." We can get really specific, like, "Help me re-engage an association planner who just lost grant funding." It also provides strategies specifically related to that, and then you can ask how to execute those strategies. So, for example, we know from reports that finance and insurance is an opportunity market for us. It's a small percentage of our current business but it has the highest average daily rate, which makes it very attractive to our hotel partners. So our salespeople are asking ChatGPT for ways we can develop business in the finance and insurance market, and really dig into that. Ultimately, AI is helping our sales team think bigger, smarter and more strategically. I've asked the sales team if they found this helpful, and, you know, salespeople are not an easy crowd. They said yes across the board. With the ChatGPT Enterprise version, I can't see their exact prompts due to privacy, but I can see the number of conversations they're having with the tool, so I know they're actively using it. GO: How are other people on your team using AI? LP: My two direct reports are our CRM database administrator and our sales coordinator. My sales coordinator does support work for the entire team, so she's using ChatGPT a lot for ideation, like when a sales manager needs an itinerary to entertain clients in Chicago. My CRM database administrator uses ChatGPT as a communication assistant because sometimes analytical personality types can benefit from exploring more communication nuances. She's also started incorporating it into data cleanup, using it to analyze reports and suggest what's missing or what would be beneficial. She uses it to help fill in gaps and identify what's not being asked or said. GO: What are some of your future plans with AI? LP: We're launching microsites for destination sales and sports, and I think it will set a model for the rest of the organization because we’re replacing our website from pre- to post-AI, like most DMO sites these days. We're currently writing copy for the microsites, and I've been getting into structured data and semantic clarity. You don't search ChatGPT or prompt ChatGPT with the same language you search Google, so content has to be written differently. Previously, you'd go to Google and say "restaurants near me." Now with ChatGPT, it's more of a conversation, so you'll say, "Hey, I'm in Scott's Addition historic district in Richmond with my kids, and we're looking for a vegan restaurant." That semantic clarity allows AI to respond with much more specific answers. I think we need to anticipate AI searches, as opposed to Google searches, in how we write content. Everyone is subconsciously expecting a personally curated experience today. When I go on Amazon, I'm expecting it to make connections that I like this, so I might also like this, without me having to tell it certain things. That's where we have to move towards, or we get eclipsed or become obsolete, especially if we're just thinking of ourselves as brokers for a destination. Greg Oates

Visit Phoenix CEO on Leading AI Strategy and Being Chill About It Jul 28 Written By Greg Oates I learned a lot about how DMO leaders can confidently integrate AI processes into their organizations after speaking with Ron Price, CDME, president and CEO of Visit Phoenix. Price is somewhat new to AI but his staff have been doing cool things with various LLMs for a while. He says his primary role with AI is providing the Visit Phoenix team with an enabling environment for success built on a culture of trust. Price accomplishes that by inspiring everyone to experiment with AI, be aware of the liabilities, share their wins, have fun with it, reach out to others for advice, and most of all, validate everything. Although, what stood out for me the most talking with Price is his calm and clear approach to AI, basically inferring (in my words, not his)... "We got this. We might do something amazing today with AI or we might not, but either way we're fully committed to seeing what it can do. We're also going to figure this AI thing out by collaborating with our many DMO industry friends. Because AI is going to change everything in a hurry, and we at Visit Phoenix are not going to be caught staring out at a Sonoran sunset while the world passes our city by." That's the vibe I got. That's leadership. That's what being a CEO means, at least for me. AI is confusing, sure, and CEOs have to worry about their boards and electeds. The thing is, we're more than two and a half years into generative AI now, and it's not going to wait for CEOs to decide if they can "trust AI" or not. I think we can all learn from Price a few things: We can de-escalate all the hubris and hand-wringing surrounding AI by being open to possibilities and having a clear set of principles, especially related to responsible AI use and verification. You can have fun with AI and focus on business outcomes at the same time. The DMO industry needs to collaborate and share best practices more intentionally to accelerate AI education, innovation and integration. We must encourage DMO staff to use AI today so they can steer the future of our industry tomorrow. Price likes talking about AI. I would encourage any DMO CEOs on the fence with AI to reach out to him. Greg Oates: Ron, how do you use AI? Ron Price: I use AI every single day, going back now about a month and a half. I'm just fascinated and interested in what it's able to do. I wouldn't say I'm an early adopter, of course, although there are some people who aren't even on it yet. Me personally, I use it for everything, like if I'm curious about something that's happening within the region. Or maybe I want to quickly compile a lot of data to help solve a problem or answer questions as I get ready for different meetings. More or less, my brain is always just firing, like, "What if we tried this or that?" And so, this year has been a cool realization about what AI can do, and seeing how it's pulling all the sources through to validate what it responds with. We have also integrated AI with Microsoft Copilot. We pay for everyone to have access to that, and then we also have a ChatGPT Team account for our staff. GO: Where else are you seeing value with AI at Visit Phoenix? RP: In our world, it's marketing, it's content. I love being surrounded by people who can write really well. It's an art to me, and I don't possess that art. It's like someone playing the piano. I'm in awe of that. So AI gives people the ability to write better, and it's okay to lean into it. Don't feel threatened by it. AI is able to give you that one golden nugget, or it suggests that one good idea that can really help someone when they're writing. Here's the fun part. Every day, we're learning something unique. We have the Cronkite School of Journalism in Phoenix, and some of the students are here. We kind of give them free rein, and we're also teaching them at the same time. The way that they use AI is amazing. It's fun to walk down the hall to see them because I'm always like, "How did you write that? How did you create that image? How did you pull that data and research together?" It's just a different generation. We're also seeing where our people are asking AI things like, "If I'm a salesperson, how do I influence a group to come here in the middle of the summer for a conference? Why is it fun to be here for a conference when it's 110 degrees out?" And what does AI have to say? Well, one thing that's great about, say, Grok, for example, it's pulling from all these little texts on Twitter, or X. They're from people saying, "Hey, I know it's summertime in Phoenix but look what I got to do." Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use. GO: Does your staff using AI increase your organization's impact in the community? RP: We not only focus on growing tourism in our community, but we're also joined at the hip with economic development. We look at our role as we're here to build a better community through tourism. And so, when you think about utilizing all the data out there, we always ask ourselves, "How could AI help us consolidate that data and crunch the numbers faster to give us a clearer picture of what we think we know?" For example, how much business that comes in through our leads touch our priority sectors? And of those sectors, which ones align extremely well with what we're doing here at Visit Phoenix? Is it semiconductors? Is it bio-med? Is it something that leans into the engineering side because of what ASU and the Department of Defense are doing? We've seen we can go back and look at the data and get a better picture of those things now. Also, as an example, we have a high propensity to book business around the semiconductor space. So we're utilizing these AI tools to quickly do research like, "Give me a list of the top semiconductor conferences that take place around the world." The responses are quicker and the results are better versus doing a traditional Google search. It's able to pull from a lot of different sources, so that's another way we're using AI. “Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use.” GO: How do you define the role of a CEO to guide a DMO forward with AI? RP: Setting up the rules of the game is important. There are areas of liability we have to be aware of about what you can and can't be pulling in. Those are the types of things we needed to figure out, you know, basically, "What is our rule book for using AI?" I like giving people the ability to use AI as they will. I think it works best whenever people know that it's a tool we want them to utilize. And if it can help us at the end of the day tell a better story, be smarter as we go after business, and be smarter with our analytics to help build our marketing strategy stronger, then use it. I try to build a team of leaders so they're CEOs of their own divisions, and I want them to be thought leaders in their areas. Also, I think AI enables us to get to answers quickly, but, and this is important, how do we validate those answers? We're really good at Visit Phoenix when it comes to validating answers, but we're usually doing it by going the long way and understanding how AI responded like it did. We're reading source by source by source, and then we kind of come to our own conclusion. It's like we're not just focused on the punch line of a joke. We can also tell you the structure of the joke. You always have to validate. We get excited about using AI because it just puts us in a new position. I think it's good to have a CEO that supports that, but that support comes from a trust within the organization. I trust that people are going to utilize AI to help make us better. GO: What keeps you up at night regarding AI? RP: My fear is how do we control and ensure that someone isn't producing something negative on our behalf, and then launching it to the world, and using this incredible tool to hurt us? Because there are people that are extremely gullible who believe whatever they're looking at. That's kind of where my brain goes sometimes. It's only because of what I've already seen these tools can do. I think across the DMO industry, we'll have some "ahas," especially when we get together in various forums to exchange ideas. We need to be talking with each other about, "Here are some things that work really well with AI, and here are the headwinds." And then, "These are the things you need to realize could happen with AI, and here are some ways you can mitigate those problems." The more we can learn from others about how they're using AI, the better. I think what you're putting together about AI strategy with all your insights is going to be extremely valuable. GO: Thank you. So, what are you thinking about next with AI? RP: As AI continues to grow, and we've talked about it here internally, what is the value of a website? In fact, we just started our next fiscal year, July 1. Website visits is no longer a key metric that we're going after. As a leader, I like knowing what's three steps ahead. We currently have these tools, but how are they going to change the way we make decisions going forward? At some point, a lot of what we're talking about now is going to be white noise. And what then? It doesn't mean our jobs of promoting a destination change. It means we're going to get so much better at telling our story through so many different avenues. I believe that our reach is actually going to broaden. We're still going to be responsible for promoting our destination and selling our destination, but how we tell the story and how we show the story is going to change as these tools evolve. Back in the day, a lot of us were reading about Moore's Law and how things just keep improving and getting cheaper, especially in technology. Now we're moving into a space where the rate of growth with AI is going to be something we've never seen before. Greg Oates

German Convention Bureau Leader on the Future of AI-Powered Meetings Jul 27 Written By Greg Oates After the global financial crisis ended in 2011, a few cities and nations around the world began promoting themselves to meeting and convention organizers based on their intellectual capital, versus venues and attractions. Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau (GCB), led this strategy in Europe at the time. Around the same year, I was visiting the House of Logistics & Mobility (HOLM) think tank in Frankfurt. The GCB suggested I visit there to better understand this new direction for attracting high-value business events in advanced industries. "The city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," Dr. Stefan Walter told me, who was a professor at HOLM at the time. "So, this [GCB] strategy is about finding the strengths of our strengths, our core competencies, and for Germany, that’s knowledge and infrastructure. It’s also about connecting ideas.” That has been my due north working in the travel industry ever since. This idea that meeting planners and attendees can tap into a deep knowledge base in a host destination, specific to their interests, for me, is intoxicating. The challenge is it takes a ton of work connecting local leaders in specific advanced industries, like aviation in Frankfurt or e-mobility in Stuttgart, with large global organizations in those same industries and convince them to bring their big annual event to Germany. It's also pretty high level. From an attendee standpoint, if I'm in Hamburg and want to learn about HafenCity, the largest urban makeover in Europe, it's not like I can easily access a bunch of people and organizations leading the future of urban development. Which, would be cool, right? AI is helping make that a reality. Germany's national Open Data/Knowledge Graph project is an ambitious AI-powered initiative to build a massive network of industry suppliers, academic organizations and business leaders across the country. Basically, by indexing the visitor industry and intellectual capital supply chain, Germany can connect the brightest minds in Germany with the rest of the world more seamlessly, effectively and equitably. An "interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," if you will. I spoke with Mr. Schultze to learn more about how AI is impacting the meetings and convention industry in Germany. Greg Oates: How is AI evolving across Germany's visitor industry? Specifically, how are your municipal CVBs and other partners thinking about and using AI right now? Matthias Schultze: Like much of the world, things really accelerated for us around two years ago with the rise of tools like ChatGPT. Suddenly, everyone, from corporates to associations, started thinking seriously about AI. We saw an opportunity and created an innovation platform called ebx.lab . It’s a peer-to-peer learning community for event planners, where we partner with scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute to explore how AI might reshape the business events space. From those early sessions, we have published a few white papers and identified a few core insights. AI clearly has potential to personalize experiences, optimize event planning processes, improve engagement and networking, and maybe most exciting, support predictive analytics. That last one, especially, being able to anticipate trends or behaviors based on data, is what feels most transformative to me personally. GO: How is the GCB embracing AI internally? MS: We developed our own internal AI strategy for the German Convention Bureau. We wanted to give both our team and our stakeholders a shared framework, something that outlined where we are today, where we want to go, and how we get there. It’s called "Driven by People, Powered by Data," and that title really reflects our belief that AI is a tool, not a solution in itself. People need to lead the process. The strategy helps us clarify not just what we can do with AI, but also what we can’t or shouldn’t do, at least not yet. It outlines our roadmap and aligns everyone across our organization and membership. GO: Is that strategy available publicly? MS: Yes, though only in German for now. But with the right AI tools, you can translate it quickly. The strategy touches on everything from marketing and communications to event planning, workflow automation, customer personalization, sustainability, and even ethics and compliance. The ethics component is particularly important. As exciting as AI is, we have to keep guardrails in place. Within our organization, we’re working hard to ensure that AI isn’t something siloed or limited to leadership. It needs to be embedded across every level. Everyone in the organization is expected to develop basic AI literacy. We’ve also worked on minimum viable products for things like dashboards and customer-facing chatbots. Some are already in use today. GO: You've always been a strong and vocal proponent for sustainability in business events. How is AI supporting you there? MS: I’m very proud of a project we developed with 29 other European countries: the Sustainability Hub for Events . It’s an AI-driven platform that brings together all kinds of sustainability related data—certifications, guidelines, best practices—and makes them accessible through an interactive AI agent. Planners can ask things like, “Can you help me build a sustainable menu?” or input event details to estimate their CO₂ footprint. It’s highly practical, and it’s making a real difference for event planners who need fast, reliable and actionable sustainability information. GO: We've talked about your Open Data and Knowledge Graph project in Germany numerous times in the past. Is that now live? MS: It’s technically live but still in progress, and probably always will be, in a sense. We’re continuously expanding it. The Open Data Germany project by the German National Tourist Board is live with its Knowledge Graph. The Open Data MICE project, which is implemented in close cooperation with the GNTB, is not yet live. One exciting element launching soon is an interactive map of research institutions in Germany. It will show where key research and innovation is taking place, including medical tech, renewable energy and so on, and link that data to infrastructure like hotels and conference venues. The idea is to visualize Germany as a knowledge landscape. If you’re planning an event and you want to anchor it around a theme like urban mobility, the map will show you which regions are most active in that field and match you with the relevant venues and experts. GO: One theme I keep obsessing about, and it's felt like a bit of a fantasy for more than a decade, is that the city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine. That idea is a direct quote from your House of Logistics and Mobility in Frankfurt, and it’s stuck with me ever since I heard it back in 2011. It's this idea of a city as a platform. Do you think we're getting closer to executing on this idea, where innovation at all levels is more accessible and shareable for more people? Ultimately what we're talking about here is the democratization of knowledge and excellence. MS: I love that idea. I really do. I think there are two layers to it. On one level, we have the smart city movement with systems that integrate transportation, energy, data and infrastructure to make better decisions. That’s already happening in many places across Europe. But on a deeper level, regarding your fantasy.... Let's say you could land in Munich, be interested in urban tech, and immediately connect with people, events and institutions aligned with that interest—that’s becoming possible too. The data already exists. It’s just scattered. But with open data standards, machine readability, and the right AI tools, we can start connecting those dots. Your fantasy city may not be so far off.

A CEO's Playbook for AI Integration Oct 10 Written By Greg Oates Your competitors are talking about AI. Your board is asking about AI. Your partners want to see your AI strategy. Many DMOs are debating the potential of AI, while an increasing number of others are already extracting real business and organizational value. The difference isn't budget or technical talent. It's knowing exactly where to look for opportunities and how to scale what works. 3 Non-Negotiables You Must Lead This, Not Delegate It: AI transformation dies in committee. The organizations seeing real results have CEOs who champion specific initiatives, remove bureaucratic friction, and signal that AI adoption is a strategic priority. This doesn't mean micromanaging prompts. It means creating air cover for teams to experiment and fail fast. Complex Impresses, Simple Delivers: Your instinct will be to pursue the flashy, sophisticated AI applications that sound impressive in board presentations. Resist it. The organizations generating real ROI start with mundane problems: expense report processing, meeting summarization, competitive monitoring, etc. These boring use cases build organizational confidence and create the foundation for more ambitious projects. Your People Know Where the Problems Are: The best AI applications emerge from the intersection of daily frustration and technological possibility. Run hackathons. Create cross-functional workshops. Ask your teams what they do that feels like waste. The solutions they surface will be more practical and impactful than anything your consultants recommend. Start Here Stop looking for AI opportunities everywhere. Focus your organization's attention on three specific areas where AI creates immediate, measurable value. The Tedium Tax: Every role in your organization includes mind-numbing tasks that consume time without creating value: data entry, compliance documentation, procurement reports, staff vacation tracking, etc. Think of these as your "Anti To-Do List." These are tasks systematically eliminated by asking, "How can I never have to do this again?" Your teams are paying a tedium tax every day. AI is the refund. The Expertise Bottleneck: Projects stall when teams hit the limits of their skills and wait for other departments. Marketing needs data analysis and campaign design mockups. Finance and HR need custom GPTs. Sales needs meetings-related technical specifications translated into customer language. AI breaks these bottlenecks by giving every team superpowers they never had before. The Blank Page Problem: Knowledge work involves ambiguous challenges where the path forward isn't clear: Strategy development, market analysis, problem diagnosis, etc. AI excels at generating multiple approaches, analyzing incomplete information, and proposing next steps when your teams are stuck. It's the thinking partner that's always available and never runs out of ideas. 6 Use Cases OpenAI's analysis of 600+ successful implementations across various industries reveals that virtually every valuable AI application falls into one of six categories. Show your teams these six use cases and they'll start finding opportunities everywhere. Content Creation: Use AI for first drafts of everything: strategy documents, marketing campaigns, product and experience descriptions, customer and community communications. AI maintains your brand voice while eliminating the blank page problem. Research and Synthesis: AI powers information gathering at superhuman speed, including market analysis, competitive intelligence, customer feedback synthesis, regulatory research, etc.. AI doesn't just find information. It structures it exactly how you need it for decision-making. Coding for Everyone: Your non-technical teams can now write Python scripts, SQL queries, and data visualizations. Your engineering teams debug faster and prototype in unfamiliar languages. AI democratizes technical capability while accelerating your experts. Data Analysis Without Degrees: Upload spreadsheets, dashboard screenshots or raw data files and get structured analysis without requiring PhD-level statistics knowledge. This is arguably the most undervalued opportunity that delivers immediate results for most DMOs. Strategic Thinking Partner: AI is a beast for brainstorming, scenario planning, product and event development, asset mapping, risk analysis, etc. AI helps structure complex problems and identifies considerations your teams might miss. This is my favorite use case for AI. Intelligent Automation: Use platforms like n8n, Relay and others to create repeatable processes that run themselves, such as weekly competitive updates, financial reporting, sales and marketing workflows, a ton of admin duties, etc. Create the process once, then let AI handle the execution while humans focus on exceptions and strategy. Implementation is Where DMOs Fail Most AI initiatives fail because organizations treat them like traditional software deployments. They're not. AI is about change management and behavioral transformation up and down the org chart. AI implementation requires different approaches to discovery, prioritization and scaling. Systematic Opportunity Hunting: Don't wait for AI use cases to emerge organically. Run structured discovery sessions where teams audit their workflows for repetitive tasks, skill bottlenecks, and ambiguous challenges. Make this process ongoing, not a one-time exercise. The Impact-Effort Matrix: Not every AI opportunity deserves attention. Prioritize based on business impact versus implementation effort. Quick wins build momentum. High-value, high-effort projects become strategic investments. Everything else gets parked until technology makes it easier. Innovation as Culture: Internal competitions accelerate discovery while building AI literacy across your organization. The goal isn't technical sophistication. It's practical business solutions that teams actually want to use. Measure What Matters: Track time saved, accuracy improved, costs reduced and capability expansion. But also measure qualitative impacts: employee satisfaction, process improvements, competitive advantages. Use this data to guide scaling decisions. Build Your AI Process Move beyond random experimentation to systematic capability building. I like Estée Lauder's 5-phase process to ensure repeatable success with AI. Does this resonate with you for your DMO? Design: Define your purpose, scope and success criteria for AI integration in a 2-page brief. No scope creep. No technical complexity for its own sake. Prepare: Ask department heads to gather relevant data and best practices. AI tools should reflect organizational knowledge, not generic approaches. Build and Test: Hire contractors where necessary to help teams develop automations/agents, implement training, integrate datasets and validate accuracy. Focus on usability, not just functionality. Launch: Deploy with user guides and change management support. Technology deployment is easy. User adoption across all departments is a total headache at first. Optimize: Feedback loops drive continuous improvement based on actual usage patterns. AI applications evolve with business needs and improved capabilities. Key Insight: Always start with fundamental questions: Why build this? What problem does it solve? What impact will it have? Is the measurement for success quantitative or qualitative? Organizations that answer these questions clearly will build more successful AI applications than those focused primarily on technical capability. Build AI-Native Workflows The most sophisticated implementations integrate AI across entire business processes rather than individual tasks. This evolution positions organizations for the agentic AI capabilities coming next. Process Decomposition: Break complex workflows into constituent tasks, identify where each AI use case category adds value, and create integrated approaches spanning from research through execution. Marketing workflows might integrate research for market understanding, analysis for opportunity mapping, ideation for strategy, content creation for product and destination development, and automation for distribution. Cross-Functional Integration: AI facilitates better collaboration by translating between departments. Technical specifications become marketing language. Customer requirements inform sales priorities. Financial models drive strategic planning. Future-Proofing for Agents: Current workflow integration prepares your organization for AI agents that can complete entire projects independently. Teams that understand how to break processes into AI-addressable components will leverage these capabilities immediately when available. The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done. This cognitive shift creates advantages that compound over time and become increasingly difficult for competitors to replicate. "The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done." Key Takeaways The question isn't whether AI will transform our industry. It's whether you'll be leading that transformation or reacting to it. Start with clear, achievable use cases and systemic approaches to build the organizational muscle needed for transformation. AI advantage isn't about having the most technical teams or biggest budgets. It's about developing capabilities for organization-wide discovery, adoption, implementation and scaling of practical business solutions. The organizations moving beyond experimentation to systematic implementation today will be best positioned to leverage the more sophisticated AI capabilities emerging tomorrow. The agents are coming. Will you be ready? Greg Oates

The ROI of AI Agents Aug 21 Written By Greg Oates Based on a bunch of conversations at DI Annual 2025 this month, it's clear that many DMO executives still equate generative AI primarily with writing and editing in ChatGPT. But as one COO of a large U.S. DMO told me, "Surely there's more to all this than just learning about prompting." So many ways to respond to that. Meanwhile, there are also DMO leaders who established AI road maps for their organizations going back two years. For them, they're increasingly focused on developing AI-powered automated workflows and their more sophisticated cousins, AI agents. The purpose of these synthetic workflows is to automate tedious, time-consuming and repetitive tasks to free up staff to focus on more high-value work. Think of it as an evolution from using AI to building AI. You begin by visually mapping what people do in your organization. Then you identify where AI can potentially take over all the mundane stuff better and faster. I’ve been working with my colleagues at Matador Network to develop automated workflows for our Studio team. We have endless terabytes of client video created during the last 10 years. Now, with AI, we want to capitalize on those existing assets to create new video, but first we need to use AI to understand what we actually own. We contracted Erick Bonilla , founder of Pocho.tech based in Uruguay, to build a series of new AI workflows in n8n. One of the automations is designed to cull through 10 years of video files in Dropbox and catalogue everything in Airtable. The AI then creates standardized file names, project IDs, links for raw edited videos and finished client hero/cutdown videos, and location and content tags. The cost to develop the AI workflow was about $2,000 all-in, and it saved more than a month of work at a mid-level manager salary. The beauty of automations/agents is you can measure ROI annually fairly easily, which will help wake up your board if they're sleeping on AI. Moreover, once an automation is in place, the savings will continue to accrue in the future indefinitely for tasks still required, and there’s zero human error. During a staff Zoom, I asked members of our Studio team if they felt these new agents signaled to them the beginning of the end of some people’s jobs. The response was unanimous. Nobody wants to do this type of repetitive grunt work. I spoke with Bonilla for his take on the future of AI agents. Greg Oates: Erick, what services does Pocho.tech provide? Erick Bonilla: We identify opportunities within organizations of all sizes, where we believe implementing AI systems can dramatically improve the efficiency of operations. We can create workflows that process data, or we can create AI agents capable of reasoning, analyzing data, creating reports, and providing decision-makers with an enhanced way of digesting information. I have been doing this for almost two years, working with people mostly in the Middle East, the US and Latin America. The Pocha company site is brand new as I try to expand in the world of AI. GO: What’s the difference between automated workflows and agents? EB: A workflow is like a mass production factory. It's a set of operations that work through specific logic to automate a repetitive process that a human has done before. This could be writing and reading emails, writing summaries, reformatting and transferring content through different tools and applications, etc. An AI agent is a thinking environment that makes decisions for you. You can set a workflow for reading your emails. But then you can have an AI agent that summarizes your emails and tells you, if you have 10 emails, what those 10 emails are about in just one email, SMS text, WhatsApp message, Google doc or whatever. GO: So an AI agent has more autonomy and decision-making capabilities than an automated workflow? EB: Definitely. The AI agent is capable of being completely autonomous to make decisions within a given context. You give it a context with defined restrictions that narrows the scope of the decisions it can make. GO: Can you provide any success stories where you worked with a client who had a specific challenge, and you created an automated workflow or agent that successfully delivered a solution? EB: The most recent example is an EdTech company in Boston that provides a training and placement program for clean energy jobs. They've been operating for the past five years, but there’s been a lack of funds, employees and program applicants to scale beyond Massachusetts. So they decided to use AI and automation to build flows without having to invest a lot of money in hiring people. What I did was streamline the application process for people interested in entering the educational program. We created a form and a workflow that takes the information from the application and puts it into an application tracking system. This system has workflows that can trigger emails, daily reports, weekly reports and invitations to interview. Then I created an AI agent. Once the applicants are interviewed by a human, we take the transcript of that, analyze it using AI, and build a report for the decision maker so they can decide if this person is capable of entering the program or not. We also created a scoring system. We built it based on human criteria, which is subjective, and then we converted that into an objective dataset so we could classify people and score them based on numbers. All of this is done by an AI agent that sets a score for the applicant at the end of the interview. Then we have a leaderboard where people are ranked, and the top 15 get into the education program and placement process. GO: Were they happy with the end result? EB: Oh yeah, very happy. Here's where the beauty and magic come in. Now the CEO can envision a way of expanding outside Massachusetts, and tell her team, "Hey, we're going to New York!" Where before, she thought she needed to hire more people in each new state to oversee the operation. And, because an AI agent works 24/7, she doesn't have to wait until 8am to get a report or transcription, or anything anymore. So now, she can think about how to scale her company more successfully without having to hire more people. GO: What's the road map looking ahead? Where are you going with the company in terms of next steps? EB: We're trying to create an outreach system because the purpose of the company is not only to train people but also to place them in clean tech job positions. The outreach system is going to help the team find more companies with open positions, so the company can place more people in those positions. We’re building a system involving AI agents and workflows where we're going to take a picture of all the open positions and analyze and understand them using AI. We want to know, what are the requirements in terms of learning and knowledge capacity for people to get in these positions, so the company can build a better training program. GO: What was the biggest challenge working with them? EB: I think the most important one, and this is something anyone working on this will experience, is the resistance of some team members who don't trust the performance of AI enough. People who have low experience working with AI, and maybe only know ChatGPT, will look at this and say, "I don't believe this can work." So that means there’s a lot of educational work. People need enough knowledge about what AI tools are capable of to suggest what can and can’t work. I think that's the main challenge. But once people see it working, they start to lean into AI. Suddenly, they become like, "This is great. Can you add this other metric? Can you make it do this other thing too? Can you make me one for my personal side hustle?" It's interesting when you see people moving from resistance to acceptance. GO: Working with you has firmly cemented something I've been preoccupied with this year. It's this: One of the most exciting things about AI, which is giving us more time back during the day, requires the most boring thing, which is having uniform file and data structure. As we've discovered together only too well, AI can't reach its full potential unless you have everything structured super cleanly. The analogy I often use is that AI is like an 8-year-old savant. The person is brilliant but he or she often needs really consistent environments and clear guardrails, or things go sideways or just crash. Can you talk about what any organization needs to focus on when it comes to file and data structure? EB: I think one of the most basic things, and I'm living this with a company I'm helping right now, is documenting files and folders exactly the same. You must set protocols for everything when you’re building a folder system to store content and data. That's one of the biggest challenges for companies trying to implement AI automation with poorly standardized systems. When we didn’t have AI a few years ago, we didn't think of a machine reading our documents or files. We never thought that could be possible, so we never really focused on creating really good file structure. The biggest challenge for companies, coming back to Matador, is how to organize the field of play so that AI doesn't struggle. We easily lose the excitement of implementing AI in an organization when an AI is trying to navigate a maze of poorly organized files. For that, you need to build SOPs that tell everyone on the team, “We're going to be naming files this way now so that a 5-year-old can read the titles and understand what's in every one of them. Because if a 5-year-old can read this set of folders and understand what's inside all of them, then AI can do that too. And if AI can find and read everything, then AI can do some truly amazing things and save companies a lot of money. GO: So how are organizations like ours, which have been in operation for a long time, supposed to go back decades and reorganize all our files? EB: We can run a workflow that can do that for you. That's where the ROI comes in. You can make a one-time investment building a workflow that's going to completely standardize all your filing and foldering. But if you do that, you have to know that the ROI might not show up right away. It's going to start paying off later in terms of the time, money, stress and everything it’s going to give back. A CEO must understand that the return on that investment is going to be ongoing through the years, not in the next quarter necessarily. If you have that mentality, then your company is going to become AI-first. GO: You’ve told me before that AI is not a tool, it's a culture. Can you explain that? EB: Right now, the biggest obstacle for AI expanding in many companies are the CEOs. I understand the challenges because they fear a lot of reputational risk. You have a board and customers that are going to be judging you. If you don't have a very good AI road map, then it could turn into a failure, and the fingers are going to be pointing at you. I understand that completely. But AI should be a culture within companies, and that starts top down because the CEO has to embrace trial and error. AI is going to fail at least during the first time you start with any automation. It's like when you're building a prompt. We were talking the other day, and you said using AI is not about writing the perfect first prompt. It's that fifth or sixth prompt that's going to get you to the right answer. You're going to be iterating with automation, too. That's something CEOs have to transmit throughout the organization. GO: I think for many tourism organizations, we haven’t even begun talking about the big picture value of AI. From an internal perspective, for example, agents offer a whole new level for optimizing operations with AI. EB: Yes, exactly. When we're in a company and we're facing challenges, the first intuitive thinking is, "How can I solve this? I'm going to Google it.” Now we're transitioning to, "How can I solve this? I'm going to ask ChatGPT.” This is great, but that's not AI-first. That's changing one tool for another. You're still browsing. It's literally the same thing. You're not really using AI. AI-first means, "I do this thing that's consuming 10 hours a week. I do the same thing every time. I spend two hours every day doing the same four steps. How can I use AI to automate this?" That's AI-first because you're using AI to stop wasting time. I think that's the culture we should be striving for. If a CEO injects the whole company with that mindset, then the employees are going to eventually use AI to solve their issues more independently and autonomously. At the end of the day, what AI really does is gives us more time and more of our lives back, and we have not yet understood that because it's new. But it's true, AI is the way for humans to have more life. GO: I want that. EB: We all do. GO: I have this belief that eventually, in any organization, all meetings will be recorded and deposited into a central knowledge base where an AI can summarize everything and connect all the key takeaways. I might have a meeting and someone on the other side of the world has a meeting, and the AI will know we're talking about the same thing. It will see and surface how there's potential opportunity to connect our efforts. It's like one plus one equals three, or more. Do you think that's where we're going and that it will benefit companies? EB: Definitely. It's the most common sense thing to do, but I know it's also counterintuitive because there are many people who would not like to have all conversations recorded. The fidelity, the accuracy of the information, and it all being in one place and uniformly structured, is everything. You can have thousands of conversations and tell the AI, "Go here and search for this specific idea in all the transcripts where we have talked about that." You just need to build the SOPs. Then a human can quality control it and say, "This is right. This isn't right. Maybe we can tweak this, or build on that." GO: I’ve experienced this firsthand where people are vehemently against this idea of all company meetings being recorded. For many it portends that clichéd dystopic future we see in science fiction, where everything's controlled and you have no freedom, right? EB: I can see it too. We must remember that these tools can be turned off. If we let the technology control us, then that's on us. I think at the end of the day, it's about how do you balance the risk and rewards? This is something CEOs are used to. Do you prefer to live in blindness and have an uncompetitive company because you decided not to take that risk with automation? Or do you take the risk and have everything recorded, even though some people are going to say it’s Orwellian in a way, and even though ultimately it's going to improve everybody's life? We have to find that balance, and that’s the CEO’s role to determine what’s best overall for the company, customers and employees in the future. GO: Any last thoughts? EB: I think we are not quite there yet to know for sure the amount of ROI that is going to come from agents and automations. Definitely it is going to be positive ROI. For that, I'm completely sure. What I'm not sure is how do we measure ROI based on the anticipated lifetime value of the process? So much is changing so quickly and it's difficult to see the future. As the tools get better, then the workflow gets better too, so the ROI increases, right? Except, we don't really have models for that. For CEOs, I think, they have to try to envision how they can measure the value of automations now, and how that might evolve exponentially in the future. Greg Oates

What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates CEOs at destination marketing and management organizations (DMOs) are seeking AI guidance specifically tailored to their chief executive roles. A CEO in the U.S. told me recently that current AI education is often too surface level, vague, unstructured, or trying to cover too much ground to be useful for a chief executive. He said, "We've been talking for a while now about how we need AI education targeting leadership, but it doesn't really exist." While destination leaders face many more questions about AI than answers, one thing is 100% clear: CEOs must own and lead their organizations' AI integration across all departments. AI isn't something to outsource or delegate to others, and it's not a "marketing thing" for the CMO to figure out. Conor Grennan , chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, consults with clients on AI strategy from JPMorgan to NASA. I asked him how important it is for CEOs to lead AI education, adoption and integration across their organizations. “CEOs have to understand how to use AI and why; they really have to have felt the delight about what AI can do,” he said. "They also have to see clearly how AI is a leadership and change management challenge, not a tech challenge. Then they need to start out being vulnerable, and be able to say, ‘Hey, I was skeptical about AI. I didn’t understand it, either. But now I can explain the way I learned it and how to communicate why it’s important to help other people understand it.” So why do CEOs need to understand AI? Jeff Bezos answered that at The New York Times DealBook Summit last year. He described how “modern AI is a horizontal enabling layer" that will soon be integrated into every device and digital application in existence. "These kind of horizontal layers like electricity and compute and now artificial intelligence, they go everywhere," he said. "I guarantee you there is not a single application that you can think of that is not going to be made better by AI." Here's the clip: Strategic AI Approaches I met with about a dozen CEOs in North America to find out what they want to know about AI specifically from a CEO perspective. Some leaders are seeking big-picture guidance with a broad overview of high-level strategy. "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” one CEO told me. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" Another chief executive said, “We see three areas of opportunity for AI: Administrative tasks and general productivity; marketing chat, SEO and data readiness; and helping customers find information about our city more effectively.… The two most important things I want to know are how to develop AI policy and how is AI changing SEO." A year ago, most CEOs had a wait-and-see attitude about AI, following how the technology evolved and what their cohorts in other organizations were doing. Today, there is a general consensus among CEOs that they need to invest in AI, but the question is how and where. One CEO told me he knows he needs to integrate AI tools and processes into his DMO, but he has three overarching questions that he wants answered first, at least at a high level: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” Other CEOs are seeking clarity on the basic fundamentals of AI: "I need to understand what are the problems that we're trying to solve with AI. What is the purpose of a chatbot, for example? What am I buying, and what can we as an organization accomplish with it?" And then others just want immediate actionable solutions: "I'm not interested in hypotheticals. Show me five ways I can implement AI on Monday. Give me turnkey AI solutions that work today." AI Data is King Personalized data is one of generative AI’s biggest value propositions. Conversational AI (chat) is the new marketplace, and it’s eating the entire funnel including in-destination engagement. In some cities, AI chat conversations between DMOs and visitors is exceeding 25% in-destination, giving DMOs a way to influence visitor behavior in real time. Also, in some industry segments like tours and activities, in-chat conversations are driving in-destination bookings with partners like GetYourGuide. Everyone is looking for first/zero-party data around that. “We have a low level of proprietary data about who is in our destination and what they’re doing,” asserted one CEO. “We have a few disparate data sources, but we need to connect those, and we want to be able to use it predictively. For example, we're looking at regression analysis to help develop future scenario modeling, and we're looking at AI to help us with that." Another CEO said, “We need data that provides material value for our partners. That’s our mandate. How are our visitors spending money and where? How are they behaving and traveling through our area? How can we help people find our partners in a more personalized way?” And one CEO added, "A key priority for us is figuring out the data equation so outbound messaging can be tailored to a 1-on-1 relationship.” Striving for that direct individual customer engagement has been the holy grail for marketers for decades. The ability to deliver mass personalization at scale is now coming into focus with enhanced AI data curation. National organizations like Destination Canada and Germany Travel have invested millions of dollars in data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to restructure their tourism product data from scratch, capitalize on the data more effectively to rank higher in AI search, and drive incremental revenue to partners. That's what the future looks like. For more information, check out the new Canadian Tourism Data Collective and Germany's Open Data Project . Today, local tourism organizations are starting to see how data structure and content architecture are strategic imperatives for them, too. One municipal CEO explained, "I think it might almost be too early to have this conversation in some areas until AI matures more. One thing I am eager to know now is how do we develop a data lake to structure our own data and messaging to make it easier for AI search tools to find." AI search and SEO are a huge conversation today. During the past year, the #1 question I heard while speaking about AI with dozens of North American destination organizations, their boards and key industry/community stakeholders, was: How do we rank higher in AI search? What happens when AI buries organic content? What’s going to happen to our websites? Are they going to disappear? Is a DMO without a website still a DMO? How do we need to produce content differently? And, what the heck is a data lake? One CEO I spoke with is planning on developing a new website for her organization. She said, "I don't even know what I don't know about AI search, but we need to figure some of that out before we start spending any money." Along with data, defining KPIs for AI integration is a hot topic of debate, and presently there isn’t a complete and codified list of metrics that DMO leaders agree on. That said, perhaps the travel and tourism industry collectively needs to understand what AI is, and what it can accomplish at scale, before attaching too many metrics to it. A CMO told me at DI MarCom Summit this month, “People didn’t ask about ROI with the internet when it first came around. We just knew we had to have it,” because it was a new channel for reaching visitors. Same as AI now. Expanding on that, he suggested that DMOs need to break AI success tracking into awareness metrics and performance metrics, and get that conversation right before anything else. Staff AI Adoption Unlike previous technology evolutions, there doesn’t seem to be as much of a generational divide between early adopters of AI and everyone else. The industry can’t look to Gen Z for guidance about how to use AI to the same degree we once asked Millennials for insights about Instagram. Again, driving AI adoption across an organization begins with the CEO. Once that’s established, the real challenge is convincing department leaders and staff to lean into AI. It's a challenge because there is widespread concern, skepticism and/or suspicion among many staff members across many industries that they’re being asked to learn new technologies that will eventually replace them. Leadership should say to employees that no one can force them to use AI, but the job market will. The data is clear. According to the Linkedin/Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index : 79% of leaders agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with Al skills than a more experienced one without 66% of leaders won’t hire someone without AI skills 60% of leaders worry their organization lacks a plan and vision to implement AI And that's a year old. But, understandably, emphasizing those numbers comes across as threatening. A better strategy for driving AI adoption is finding staff members who are already seeing success with AI, supporting them with access to education and pro AI models, and working out from there. The more employees see their colleagues using AI, the more some of them feel inclined to lean in. Therefore, every DMO needs a comprehensive strategic AI road map that includes purpose, policy, education, integration and a continuous feedback loop across all levels of staff. CEOs need to create a space for that. "We're giving our staff time to play around with AI, but they have to present what they're focusing on and what they're learning to their individual supervisor," a CEO told me. Another added, “We're focusing on staff adoption. But I need you to explain to me what works, how to implement, and what should I watch out for." I'm presently working with our departments at Matador Network to explore a bunch of various AI models to optimize workflows, boost creativity, enhance strategic planning, diversify product, etc. There's a well-communicated mandate from the top that Matador will become an AI-first company, and sooner than later. To help accelerate that, we created an AI task force to bring more perspectives from across the company together to integrate AI into operations. That has been valuable with some immediate takeaways, such as staff is now reaching out and asking for assistance with AI. But it's only a start. "There's this idea that if you can get a core group of people using AI then their attitudes and behaviors will spread organically throughout the rest of the company," said Conor Grennan at NYU. "It doesn't work that way. You have to find the people who have fears about AI and listen to them to understand why. You have to say, 'Yes, AI does suck at that, but here's what it's good at.' You also need to weed out the negative people who are against AI outright. They're dangerous." 5 Key Takeaways Let's go back to that first CEO who wants to know the five big questions about AI. Based on the input from the above CEOs, here's a first stab at that: How can I create AI policy that serves our organization but doesn't suppress experimentation among staff? (Interestingly, policy did not come up that much with the CEOs I spoke with.) How do we need to develop our websites, content and data to rank higher in AI search? How is AI SEO different, and the same, as old SEO? What are existing AI chat platforms accomplishing, how are visitors using them, and how are they influencing travel decision making and purchase behavior? If AI is not just for marketing, what does the ecosystem of AI tools for all departments look like across the organization? And what do they do in terms of increasing productivity, creativity and quality? How do I get staff to buy in? We know AI is an imperative for our organization's competitive advantage and relevance. And we know AI is an imperative for employees for their professional growth and marketability. But how do we get our people to really believe in the need to embrace AI? Greg Oates

Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Royce Chwin, president and CEO of Destination Vancouver , personifies how a DMO chief executive needs to establish and articulate the mandate for integrating AI across the organization. That was the topic of our last Destination AI post where 12 CEOs explained: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . Early in 2024, Chwin addressed the full staff in Destination Vancouver’s office before a session I was presenting there on AI. “We cannot not do this,” he said, stating that the organization needed to adopt AI processes to stay relevant in the industry and increase its value in the community. If Destination Vancouver is positioning itself as an innovative DMO, he explained, then the road ahead with AI was clear. Since then, Destination Vancouver launched a new website fully integrated with AI where visitors can customize how they find travel information. The build was a two-year process requiring an inordinate amount of learning to capitalize on generative AI. The team also developed an AI policy guide that Chwin shared for this post. The comprehensive document is designed to "provide clear protocols that maximize and encourage the use of Al tools where appropriate and safe to do so, while minimizing any potential risks and concerns." The policy guide encourages staff to use AI for "enhancing productivity, efficiency, creativity or decision-making." It defines when not to use AI models and how staff is required to review and validate all AI outputs for accuracy and bias. Also, Stefan Hawes, vp of global marketing, initiated the development of an internal AI Council, bringing together a diverse group of staff to coordinate AI processes across the organization. Chwin shared an internal briefing report outlining the purpose of the Council as follows: It is recommended that an AI Council be established immediately to provide a centralized body for managing AI-related initiatives and to expand training opportunities for team members. The Council will focus on: Setting strategic priorities related to AI Selecting use cases, implementing projects/initiatives/AI software purchases and evaluating their effectiveness Developing a data strategy to support AI adoption and initiatives Developing an AI education, literacy and adoption program Ensuring ethical compliance Fostering cross-departmental collaboration to maximize the impact of AI projects We created a similar AI task force at Matador, and the value of that cannot be overstated to better assess how staff from different departments perceive, and misperceive, AI in general. I talked with Chwin this week to better understand how a DMO CEO can best lead strategic AI implementation across his or her organization. The purpose of this post is to help inform, inspire and influence other CEOs to consider the opportunities of AI in a new light. Greg Oates: Royce, you've been a strident proponent of AI for a couple years now, and yet there are many other CEOs who are still reticent. How did you personally come to decide Destination Vancouver needed to embrace AI? Royce Chwin: The perception still of some DMOs is that we are behind when it comes to technology. We're slow to adapt. We're slow to evolve. You see all these other organizations in the travel sphere around us that are able to move much quicker. They might be capitalized better. They can adjust. They can pivot quicker to take on these new technologies, and they can experiment seemingly without the degree of fear or consternation that maybe some DMOs have. So, I think there's lots of different reasons. For us, I mean, it's day and night. We can't not do that. Our entire ecosystem that we play in has some level of AI being used. Number one is our customers. They’re using AI. So it goes back to that same idea that you and I have discussed many times before: How do we as a DMO stay relevant and how do we show value? AI is a response to answering those two things. GO: In many organizations today, there’s often skepticism and suspicion among staff about how AI might take their jobs, or they’re dismissive of AI altogether. How does your team feel about AI overall? RC: I'm not finding a fear in our organization for using AI. I think it's a different set of challenges. I think there are so many derivatives of AI out there that people don't know what to focus on. Because you can’t and don't need to focus on 40 different AI tools. The question is, what are the best tools that are most relevant to the work that I need to do? That, I think, in my experience is a bigger challenge. My sense of it is that AI can be so overwhelming. It can seem unbelievably complicated. So we had to ask ourselves, do we have the time, resources and skill sets to simply understand it? Secondly, are we asking better questions to understand what in the organization we need to solve, and can AI help? GO: In a previous post, I shared input from 12 DMO CEOs about how they feel about AI. What are you hearing from other CEOs? RC: I was over in Europe recently for Destinations International’s Global Leaders Forum where I was onstage with Sherrif Karamat (CEO of PCMA) and Petra Stušek (CEO at Ljubljana Tourism). We were talking about the importance of face-to-face meetings and so on, and Sherrif made a comment that DMOs are really behind using AI. It was kind of a blanket statement, and he's not wrong. But, I said to Sheriff that I think a lot of DMOs are behind because it's like throwing confetti in somebody's face and asking them to pick the best pieces. They don't even know what they're trying to evaluate, and it’s also moving so fast. In the meantime, our customers are running around us using AI for all kinds of things. And so I think that there's not so much a fear of using AI. It’s more that people are questioning how to respond to the increasing emergence of AI because they’re thinking, “I'm not really 100% clear on the business problem I'm trying to solve that supports my mandate.” For us, and you saw it when you visited, we were really clear on what it is that we needed to do. We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI. “We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI.” GO: I’ve been asserting that CEOs should own and lead AI adoption in their organizations to have the best chance for success. I don't mean lead it day to day. I mean the chief executive must establish the mandate that AI is something the organization is going to invest in, and articulate why and how to the entire staff. Connor Grennan, chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, emphasized to me that’s the only way this works. Do you agree? RC: Yes, I absolutely believe it must come from the CEO because the CEO has to clear the vision with the team. And with something as seismic as AI, and how it’s evolving in our daily life, in our world, I think the CEO has a responsibility to address it and how it will impact the organization. Everyone needs to understand how we’re going to use AI in alignment with our mission and strategic goals, and how it will support the mandate. That's all CEO level. That's the responsibility on my head. Also, I can't imagine going in front of my Board and asking, “Hey, what are you doing with AI? What should we do with AI?” So it has to come from the CEO, but my Board has also enabled me. Like, there's no grief from my Board. Zero. We are fully enabled. GO: You've created the necessary structure to help govern AI integration with your AI Policy and AI Council. Can you expand on the thinking behind those? RC: We developed an AI policy that’s designed to enable people to use AI and not discourage them from experimenting. Obviously, some education is required in terms of proprietary information and those kinds of things. But we're really leaning into this and we're going to assign some time for it to enable the organization to experiment and play with AI without fear of reprisal. Naturally there needs to be governance around it, but governance does not mean stopping creativity. Governance means we’re creating and delivering new opportunities for creativity. There just needs to be structure around that. Also, Stefan came up with the idea of pulling together an AI Council in the organization, which I think is fantastic. We're getting individuals from each business line, including myself, and we’re going to talk about AI, its impacts, what we need to be thinking about, and how we'll improve our website and the organization as a whole. So we're creating dialogue around it to define opportunities. For example, I'm really excited about AI as it relates to all the country market analysis that we do. We've been doing that by spreadsheet, but now we’re exploring AI to provide the insights we need to inform our market planning more effectively. There are lots of different examples like that, but you only discover them by being open to experimenting with AI. Greg Oates

Toronto & Denver Tourism Leaders on the 5 Big AI Questions for CEOs Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates A year from now, the travel and tourism sector might look back and thank Andrew Weir, president and CEO of Destination Toronto , for catalyzing how DMOs move forward with AI. At PCMA Convening Leaders in January this year, I asked Weir what CEOs need to understand about AI at a high level. Numerous other CEOs have told me there’s a complete lack of AI education specifically designed for DMO chief executives. His answer was first shared anonymously in our previous post, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” said Weir. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" At the end of that post I suggested what those five questions might be based on all the CEO insights in there, and I've since been shopping them around to vet them. A few weeks ago, for example, Richard Scharf, president and CEO at Visit Denver , suggested restructuring the questions to create a more logical hierarchy. Now, the first three deal with internal operations while the last two identify external, visitor-facing priorities. Yesterday, I spoke again with Weir, as well as Paula Port, vice president of marketing at Destination Toronto, for their input on the five questions. The goal here is to provide clear structure around AI platforms and processes for DMOs leading up to Matador Network’s collaboration with U.S. Travel at ESTO in Phoenix this fall. Together, we’ll be co-hosting an interactive, multi-station “AI Playground” educational activation during the three days of the conference. Here are the five big AI questions. These will evolve but now we have a foundation to begin building consensus on how DMOs can capitalize on opportunities and navigate challenges with AI today. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The 5 Big AI Questions 1. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? A growing number of DMO leaders say their teams embrace AI for the most part, and many are actively developing basic AI strategy. That’s a significant shift from a year ago. At the same time, there's still varying degrees of cynicism and skepticism about AI in other organizations. I asked Weir about his staff. “I don't feel like we're dragging the team into this,” he said. “It's really more a matter of how people are at such different places with AI. So our goal is figuring out how to channel all their knowledge and energy, and kind of align and unify that, without stifling anyone’s creativity.” Scharf at Visit Denver emphasized that this question should be the first one, because successful AI integration begins with understanding your staff’s grasp of AI and their appetite for leaning into it. “ChatGPT is growing like Zoom did a few years ago so we know we need to use it,” he said. “The first thing we did was survey staff to assess how they feel about AI, and how or if they’re using it. Then we started off with small bites like email. Now we think of AI as a toolkit, and we're continuing to explore what tools are appropriate for different needs.” Port added that AI integration across teams works best with both structured and self-directed learning. “We started by making everything (ChatGPT Plus, Google Gemini) available to everyone, so they were given access to tools and resources, but a lot of this is really self-directed learning,” she said. “What we're seeing now is people have taken advantage of that and moved forward with it. Some maybe a little bit further than others, so maybe we need to address that. I think we still need more use cases and more structured learning because we're not all at the same level in terms of knowing and understanding how to put AI to use.” 2. How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? Destination Toronto was one of the first North American municipal DMOs to develop an AI policy. They began the process by pulling examples from larger government-operated tourism organizations including Destination Canada and Destination British Columbia. “We set up that policy structure first in terms of what we wanted as an organization, and also being very clear that any use of AI was meant to drive business results,” said Weir. “I think we were able to get there pretty quickly because we didn't create a series of regulations. We built a series of philosophies and principles to guide where we go. It was meant to put guardrails around protecting information, while at the same time, stimulate learning and sharing. Because we said to the team that you are free and encouraged to use AI, but there is an expectation that you will share what you've learned.” Port explained further that, “We leveraged existing processes already in place from a content perspective in terms of bias, IT usage, etc. We have an assessment process for any sort of software application that we're looking to use, so we did the same with AI.” (Note: The next GuideGeek Destination AI post will be with Kara Franker, president and CEO of Visit Florida Keys, who is also an attorney. We discussed AI policy at length.) 3. How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? Scharf stated that integrating AI platforms and processes beyond marketing is “where all the work is happening now.” His organization is switching out regular stand up meetings with extended AI workshops and visiting speakers to learn more about AI tools for various use cases across departments. Leadership, he said, including himself, are present at these meetings so everyone is learning together. Weir and Port both addressed this question, saying they need to first explore how Simpleview, Cvent and other tech partners are integrating AI functionality before looking at any new AI platforms. We discussed PCMA’s Project Spark , an AI-native event development tool that includes the new Destinaitor destination sourcing platform. DMO leadership and sales teams are exploring Spark to understand how clients are using new AI software to evaluate, compare and source destinations for business events. Others, like Kara Franker mentioned above, are looking for new AI solutions to optimize their HR and accounting departments, but she said many of the available options presently are only enterprise grade. Something DMOs should really look at, and I’m not sure how/if many already are, but there is proven value in creating custom GPTs for sales teams. GPTs are like mini ChatGPTs designed for specific purposes that anyone with a ChatGPT Plus account can create. For example, a sales rep can build a knowledge base inside a GPT by uploading sales materials, examples of successful bids, product information, pricing, team members, case studies, testimonials and other data. The next step is to develop internal GPT instructions to direct what the GPT does and what it prioritizes. Following that, the rep can then chat with the GPT and ask it to create a customized bid for a potential client that pulls all relevant source materials from the knowledge base that best supports the pitch. I’m imagining the ability to create custom GPTs is going to soon be a standard and required capability for all sales teams. One of the earliest enterprise examples of this was Salesforce’s Einstein GPT, which has since morphed into Agentforce. We use them at Matador because of improved efficiency and quality. GPTs also provide a new option for creative brainstorming, which some salespeople appreciate who don't identify as being super creative. Increases in sales production can be clearly identified. However, there's increasing conversation about tracking success in other departments. When AI delivers clear improvements in efficiency and saves people significant time, how do you measure that? One concern is that people will then just work a six hour day versus eight hours. The common thinking is that organizations will need to adjust productivity benchmarks, but this is a messy conversation. I don’t know enough to comment on that yet, but I wanted to put a pin in it because it’s something we’ll all need to look at eventually as AI scales in the workforce. 4. How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? I was addressing Visit Denver’s Board a while back and one member suggested that DMOs won’t need websites soon because they’ll be replaced by a ChatGPT-like window. I’m surprised by how much this comes up. For one thing, DMOs will always need some kind of online knowledge base for AI search queries. If anything, that will require more content and more comprehensive product information because AI search thrives more than anything on data structure, clarity and specificity. That said, the web user interface will likely evolve considerably. Expect to hear a lot more about how DMOs are developing data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to optimize data structure for AI search. For further context, here's a Perplexity Pro response to the question: "Are tourism boards developing data lakes and warehouses to optimize their sites for AI search?" Weir suggested that this conversation about the future of websites is not unlike what we went through 15 years ago, when people were lamenting the death of DMO sites because social media was deemed by some as the new web. More important, he asserted, is seeing how AI search is evolving and being prepared to adapt strategy. “I think there is a push-pull here between how we lead and where customers are at,” said Weir. “We want to deliver more information through our AI assistant and AI search in general, but customers aren't really there yet. I don't know what the percentage is, but the majority of people are still using Google. They're still beginning an interaction on the web by entering search terms in Google the traditional way. At some point, that's going to flip, right? It's going to be a few percent more each month or quarter, whatever that is. But how far ahead of it do we get? And how do we calibrate? We can try to lead on this, but you know, we also have to stay in step with where our customers are too.” 5. How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? Chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI have dashboards that clearly identify what visitors are asking about in the destination. That helps inform content and product development strategy, and the data is valuable for community engagement. AI chat platforms also operate 24/7 in 50+ languages, which helps DMO influence in-destination travel and spending for a much wider audience than ever before. How to best capitalize on conversational AI, and ultimately conversational commerce, is an evolving topic because we’re still in the early days where travelers are learning they can search with large language models and trust them. ChatGPT has 400 million weekly users but ChatGPT only added full functioning search capability for all users a few months ago. Consumers are just beginning to understand that they can now “talk” to a city. To help accelerate understanding and adoption of AI chat among visitors, Port asserted that the onus is on DMOs to promote their AI chat robustly like any other channel. Weir did that recently by highlighting Destination Toronto’s GuideGeek-powered “6ix” chat platform on LinkedIn, asking, “Ever had a chat directly with a city?” Weir was specifically promoting the organization’s WhatsApp platform, where people can now have a highly personalized, iterative conversation directly with Destination Toronto via the GuideGeek AI integration. The same functionality exists with the other Meta platforms, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. A few hours after Weir's post I received a Slack message from our CTO Stefan Klopp wondering what was going on in Toronto. WhatsApp volume was spiking, he said, and he was asking if Toronto had sent out a press release promoting 6ix, or something. No, it was just a quick CEO social media post. Also, Tourism New Zealand just launched a new campaign in collaboration with “A Minecraft Movie” that integrates GuideGeek-powered prompt questions to trigger further engagement. So, those are just a couple examples of how DMO/NTOs can drive AI chat engagement. The question for Weir and Port though is about the types of questions people are asking in AI chat platforms. Presently, a lot of the chat conversations are more utilitarian, related to queries about hotels, restaurants, attractions, events, directions, etc. So as conversational AI adoption increases, will DMOs focus more on developing content that answers those basic types of questions, like what hotel, restaurant or attraction is highly rated, and how to get there. Or, should DMOs continue to focus mainly on developing what is generally perceived as more inspirational destination and experiential content? "The question then becomes about responding to inquiries versus the inspirational side," explained Port. "Like, all of these articles, all of this content that we serve up, that is not in response to a question per se. It's more packaged to inspire people. I think a lot of that's going to have to exist outside our environments, maybe, whether it's influencers, it's your earned media strategy, it's content partnerships, things like that. That's where I think the inspiration will exist. But we really have to move to being more of the informative one, on our website or whatever a website is. But it needs to be very specific in answering questions. We already see that on GuideGeek." Weir summed up, saying, "I think this ends up relating more to, again, that question of where the customers are. Are we putting ourselves in a position to answer their questions and deliver the information in the way they're looking for it, using AI and the data lake approach? Or, are we curators like we've always been, inspiring visitors with local experiences, or is the customer now the curator by virtue of how they're asking questions today?" Summary These five takeaways are aligned with the five big AI questions. AI adoption begins with talking to DMO staff to understand what the organization is working with. Love the idea about marrying structured and self-directed learning, and being intentional about that with staff. At some point, for AI adoption to scale and continually evolve on an ongoing basis, there needs to be AI leaders in any organization who pick up the torch and inspire their colleagues to lean into AI. Otherwise, things tend to plateau with the same people using the same AI models. AI policy is intended to encourage staff to innovate with AI as much as it's meant to protect organizations. AI is the death of "I don't know," so it can benefit all staff in all departments. That in itself is enough ROI to validate initial investments in AI. The tools can provide a foundation of knowledge and direction for problem solving and strategic planning exponentially better than traditional search. Some organizations, like Visit Greece who we work with, have phenomenal website data structure ideally optimized for AI search. Meanwhile, one CEO told me "Our website is a mess with outdated content and poor data structure. We need to rebuild from scratch with AI search top of mind." Chat is the new marketplace, and AI is eating the entire funnel including in-destination. Moreover, AI chat data provides DMO leaders with insights into what visitors are asking about. Although, I think as chat adoption scales mainstream, the conversations will evolve beyond asking for a good hotel or restaurant. Greg Oates

Why Small Steps With AI Create Big Wins for Tourism Organizations Sep 22 Written By Greg Oates Key Theme: How to Align Strategic Risk Management and Progressive AI Implementation The rush to transform everything with AI has dominated boardroom discussions since ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Yet the most successful organizations aren't pursuing wholesale AI overhauls. They're taking calculated, incremental steps that deliver real value while building capabilities for the future. MIT researchers interviewed senior managers at 21 large companies actively using generative AI. Their findings challenge the prevailing narrative about AI transformation. Companies are deliberately choosing "small t" transformations over risky, large-scale implementations. This approach works particularly well for tourism organizations where customer trust and regulatory compliance matter deeply. Tourism organizations face unique challenges with AI adoption. Customer data privacy concerns run high. Regulatory requirements vary across jurisdictions. Service quality directly impacts reputation. The research reveals that successful companies treat AI implementation like climbing a risk slope. They start with low-risk internal applications before moving to customer-facing solutions. This measured approach isn't about being timid. It's about being smart. Tourism CEOs can build organizational confidence, develop necessary skills, and demonstrate tangible value before tackling more complex implementations. Start With Universal Productivity Tools That Employees Already Want to Use The research uncovered a surprising reality. Employees were already using ChatGPT and other public AI tools without permission. Companies responded by providing secure, private versions of these tools. This grassroots adoption pattern offers tourism organizations a clear starting point. Consider how your marketing team writes destination descriptions. Your operations staff creates training materials. Your finance team prepares reports. These tasks consume hours of employee time across every department. Private AI instances from providers like ChatGPT or Claude eliminate security concerns while boosting productivity. McKinsey built a custom platform called Lilli that connects AI to 40 internal knowledge sources. The result? Seventy-five percent employee adoption in under a year. Time savings up to 30%. Substantially improved work quality. Tourism organizations don't need to build something this sophisticated initially. Even basic AI writing assistants can transform daily work. Microsoft Copilot integration takes this further. Employees can search across company documents instantly. They can pull content from emails, meeting transcripts, and presentations. One manager described it as having "a super search engine" for company information. Imagine your team finding that obscure policy document from three years ago in seconds rather than hours. The beauty of starting here? Minimal risk. Maximum adoption. Employees want these tools. They're probably already using consumer versions. Providing enterprise versions addresses security concerns while meeting existing demand. Your IT team maintains control. Your employees get productivity gains. Everyone wins. Some employees will still seek external tools for specific needs. One product manager uses Midjourney for quick visuals. Another uses voice-to-text tools for performance reviews. Accept this reality. Focus on providing core tools internally while establishing clear guidelines for external tool usage. Deploy AI for Specific Roles While Keeping Humans in Control Once basic AI tools gain traction, tourism organizations can target specific job functions. The key insight from the research? Maintain human oversight for quality control. This "human in the loop" approach reduces risk while capturing efficiency gains. Customer service represents an ideal starting point for tourism organizations. AI can help agents find information quickly. It can suggest responses in real time. It can analyze call patterns to identify coaching opportunities. MIT researchers found AI coaching tools increased call center productivity by 14% on average. New and low-skilled workers improved by 34%. Morgan Stanley equipped financial advisors with an AI assistant trained on over one million internal documents. The tool doesn't replace advisors. It helps them find information faster so they can focus on customer relationships. Tourism organizations can apply this same principle. Help your concierge staff access local recommendations instantly. Enable tour guides to answer obscure historical questions accurately. Support reservation agents with instant access to availability across properties. CarMax demonstrates another powerful application. The company uses AI to generate descriptions for over 5,000 car pages. Manual creation would take multiple humans 11 years. With AI, it takes hours. The 80% approval rate from editorial review proves quality doesn't suffer. Tourism organizations can apply this to property descriptions, tour summaries, and destination guides. Creative teams at Dentsu use AI throughout their workflow. From proposals to budgeting to ideation. The emerging technology director noted employees spend less time on mundane tasks. They create higher-quality content with less effort. Tourism marketing teams can similarly accelerate campaign development, social media content creation, and promotional material design. Finance departments traditionally resist new technology. Yet some organizations successfully use AI for audit reports, regulatory compliance, and fraud detection. Amazon's finance team reports employees shifted from repetitive tasks to critical thinking work. Tourism organizations can start with expense report processing or invoice matching before tackling complex financial analysis. Transform Customer Experiences Gradually With Clear Boundaries Customer-facing AI sits highest on the risk slope. Yet the potential rewards justify careful exploration. The research shows companies succeeding by setting clear boundaries and expanding gradually. Chatbots evolved from frustrating phone trees to sophisticated conversational agents. John Hancock's insurance chatbots handle common queries effectively. Human agents focus on complex issues. Starbucks, Domino's, and CVS expanded to voice interactions. Video interactions come next. Tourism organizations can start with FAQ chatbots on their websites. Add booking assistance once that works well. Expand to voice-based concierge services when ready. Personalization transforms online shopping experiences. Tapestry, parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, uses real-time language modifications. The conversational tone mimics in-store associates. Revenue increased at least 3%. Tourism organizations can personalize trip recommendations based on past bookings. Adjust website content for different traveler segments. Customize email campaigns for individual preferences. Software companies already embed AI throughout their products. Adobe users create and modify images effortlessly. Canva simplifies presentation creation. Lucidchart converts text descriptions into flowcharts. Tourism organizations benefit as their existing software vendors add AI features. Property management systems will suggest optimal pricing. Booking platforms will predict cancellation risks. Marketing tools will automate campaign optimization. The key? Start small. Test thoroughly. Expand gradually. A failed internal productivity tool frustrates employees. A failed customer-facing AI damages your brand. Move up the risk slope deliberately. Build Foundational Capabilities Before Attempting Major Transformations The research revealed an uncomfortable truth. Scaling AI from pilot to production is harder than expected. Data quality issues multiply. Edge cases appear more frequently. Integration challenges compound. Many organizations discovered they needed stronger foundations before pursuing ambitious AI projects. CarMax's chief information officer emphasized data quality. "Good data will give you good results from AI." Poor data produces unreliable outputs. Tourism organizations must audit their data systems. Customer records across multiple systems need reconciliation. Historical booking data requires cleaning. Property information needs standardization. Governance structures matter equally. Who approves AI projects? How do you measure success? What happens when AI makes mistakes? Establish these frameworks before scaling implementations. Small pilots can proceed without perfect governance. Enterprise deployments cannot. Capital One's chief scientist warned against the "gold-rush mentality." Thoughtful, responsible implementation beats rushed deployment. Build the scaffolding to bring everyone along. Tourism organizations should resist pressure to match competitors' AI announcements. Focus on sustainable progress over headlines. Management buy-in proves essential for larger projects. One technology company's AI efforts stagnated until the CEO personally championed them. Small wins build credibility for bigger investments. Document productivity gains from initial deployments. Share customer satisfaction improvements. Make the business case concrete before requesting major funding. Summary: Small Transformations Today Enable Big Transformations Tomorrow The research delivers a clear message for tourism CEOs. Successful AI implementation doesn't require revolutionary change. It requires evolutionary progress. Start with universal productivity tools that employees already want. Target specific roles with human oversight. Transform customer experiences within careful boundaries. Build foundational capabilities systematically. This approach particularly suits tourism organizations. Your business depends on human connections. Technology should enhance these connections, not replace them. Your customers value authentic experiences. AI should enable better experiences, not artificial ones. Your reputation takes years to build and moments to destroy. Measured AI deployment protects what you've built while enabling future growth. The companies studied aren't waiting for perfect AI solutions. They're using today's technology to solve real problems while preparing for tomorrow's possibilities. They're training employees, cleaning data, and establishing governance. When breakthrough AI capabilities arrive, they'll be ready to capitalize quickly. Tourism organizations can follow this same path. Deploy AI writing assistants next month. Add customer service chatbots next quarter. Enhance personalization next year. Each step builds on the last. Each success enables the next. Small transformations compound into competitive advantage. The AI transformation race isn't won by the fastest starter. It's won by consistent, strategic progress. Tourism CEOs who embrace "small t" transformation today position their organizations for "big T" transformation tomorrow. The journey starts with a single step up the risk slope. Greg Oates

How to Develop AI Strategy for Your Organization Oct 12 Written By Greg Oates The 2050 City AI Roadmap provides a high-level strategic framework for how DMOs and other organizations can capitalize on AI to optimize internal operations, resources and knowledge, and ultimately, drive partner revenue. DMOs have all kinds of strategic plans, master plans, business and marketing plans, etc. The 2050 City AI Roadmap outlines the process to develop your AI strategic plan. It defines the big picture outlook for AI as the future of commerce, and it proposes a methodology to help DMO leaders prioritize, organize and navigate how they go about integrating AI across their organization. Presently, we're rolling this out with Visit Mesa , Tourism Richmond in British Columbia, and The Florida Keys & Key West . The three CEOs for those organizations have all agreed to share takeaways and business outcomes with each others' teams to cross-pollinate learning and accelerate AI process integration. That spirit of knowledge sharing and co-learning for me is huge, because we as an industry are all pretty much flying blindly with AI from a macro perspective. Yes, we've come a long way in the last year. Every DMO CEO I talk to these days is now implementing various AI processes and seeing value. However, we're all kind of flying this plane while we're building it at the same time, and we don't really have a destination, or even due north, in mind. The 2050 City AI Roadmap was designed to identify where we're going with this emergent technology that's both incredibly powerful and often highly unpredictable. It also defines how high-end AI chat platforms, like Matador Network's GuideGeek AI , are the tip of the spear for agentic commerce. The following guidelines are based on experience in the workplace to deliver new value with AI for your team, board, industry partners and community stakeholders. Internal & External Direction Every decision related to AI strategy should first be defined through an internal or external lens. Your board members will typically view internal workplace optimization as tactical. Externally, AI integrations that are consumer-facing and revenue generating are usually perceived as more strategic. Internal Facing From an internal standpoint, the focus of the AI Roadmap is on optimizing operations to take advantage of an organization's aggregate of resources and knowledge. Imagine the totality of insights across every team member in terms of their expertise and networks in their communities. AI systems are designed to pool and capitalize on that, but only if an organization's knowledge base is structured intelligently. That means rebuilding your folder structures and files naming conventions so an AI can find everything. According to Slack, workers spend 41% of their time on menial tasks, including endless hours just looking for information. The overall losses related to productivity, quality of work and workplace, and physical/mental health are crazy. So let's start there with AI strategy to address our internal digital dumpster fire. External Facing Externally, from a marketing, sales and visitor/partner engagement perspective, AI strategy begins with integrating a robust AI chat platform like GuideGeek. DMOs have never really had proprietary information on who their visitors are. They have geo-location, credit card spend, event attendance data, etc., which show visitor behavior. But none of those really identify visitor motivations and mindsets indepth. With an AI chat platform, DMOs can now pull analytics showing what visitors are actually asking and what they want to know on an individual and aggregate basis. We launched our new GuideGeek V2 analytics dashboard this past week, which provides deeper, fuller insights into visitor psychographics. That data then informs all kinds of resource allocation decisions related to content development, AI SEO strategy, data analysis, product and destination development, community engagement, etc. CEO Roles AI is best defined as a new digital "co-intelligence" that can communicate, reason and create for the first time ever, versus just another new technology. We emphasize that AI is really a new environment for collaboration more than anything, just not solely among humans anymore. Learning AI is not like learning Photoshop. You can only "teach" AI up to a point, like trying to teach someone how to ride a bike. You can't teach a child how to stay on two wheels without falling in a classroom. He or she actually has to start pedaling, and eventually the child's mind and body basically have a conversation, so to speak, with the bike to grasp the fundamentals of moving forward successfully. Same with AI. The only way to learn AI is to use AI. Helping human teams embrace this new co-intelligence (and it's not like there's a choice) falls under the umbrella of change management. That's a CEO's wheelhouse. It will take more than a few years for many humans to reconcile their minds and values with this new relationship, and it falls on the CEO's shoulders to steward that reconciliation. Likewise, CEOs oversee AI governance, policy and privacy. I've shared before how AI governance should be viewed less like a car brake and more like a steering wheel to inform, direct and accelerate AI adoption and integration. Lastly, only CEOs can scale long-term AI benefits and business outcomes effectively. You can't really delegate this. AI efforts will plateau at times, some or many AI experimentations will fail, and there are always staff members who will drag their feet because they just don't like AI. DMO CEOs are chief people officers and it's on them to create the right culture for scaling AI platforms and processes effectively for everyone in their crews. Agentic AI This is where things get interesting. AI agents and agentic commerce might sound super confusing for many or most staff members. Lots of land mines to watch out for, sure, but even more reasons for us building a macro DMO AI strategic framework. One of the key objectives for the AI Roadmap is to elevate AI agents and agentic commerce as the two interrelated cornerstones for AI strategy, and explain why. Doing so shows the true big picture value of AI, and it drives home how we eventually need to move way beyond training people the basics of prompting. Yes, it's intimidating, but we introduce the labels and contexts relating to agentic AI early on in the process. That gets some people thinking bigger about AI, and it entices the AI champions in the group to start experimenting with agents. AI Agents (Internal) For internal AI strategy, leading DMOs are developing AI agents and automated workflows to address the aforementioned 41% of time that staff members spend on grunt work and trying to find information. They are proven, they work, and most of all, they deliver measurable ROI. We're working with outside contractors at Matador to develop and implement agents and automations for both ourselves internally and for DMO clients. We are already seeing success, and there's been a recent influx among our people asking for agents. It's an amazing thing to see when staff members start requesting new AI integrations like that, proactively. That's when you know your AI strategy is working at least on some level. Agentic Commerce (External) AI agents are also the foundation for agentic commerce. According to Mastercard , "Agentic commerce is a new form of online and mobile shopping, in which an AI agent 'closes the loop' or completes tasks for a user — such as searching for items, comparing options and making a purchase — with limited or no manual inputs needed from that user. For example, while chatting in a generative AI app, you could tell the AI agent, 'Book me a nonstop flight to London for under $600 next week — no red-eyes,' and the agent will review airlines, nearby airports and your loyalty memberships and payment card rewards to identify the best option, purchase it and then share it with you." Just like with AI agents, developing agentic commerce architecture covers a wide spectrum of sophistication and capabilities. Going back to the analogy of flying a plane while building it with no clear final destination in mind, agentic commerce is the point on the map where we want to land. With GuideGeek, we have Kayak, GetYourGuide, Skyscanner and other booking tools integrated into the platform with a click-through UX/UI. Looking ahead, we're working with one national tourism organization to bring some of their national partners' booking engines (air, hotel, tour op, etc.,) into the platform to eventually convert sales in-chat. Subscribe to Mastercard Signals to keep up-to-date on agentic commerce and access intelligence like this Mastercard Payments Trends Navigator report. Staff Training & AI Integration Training staff and implementing AI processes across all departments is really the meat of the 2050 City Roadmap. But none of that should proceed without DMO leadership embracing all the above, and communicating it clearly to all staff. Easier said than done, though. Leadership needs to continually communicate a high-level approach to AI strategy, because it won't really click for many staff (or leadership) at the beginning of this process. That, of course, needs to be married with all the practical training initiatives we're continuing to develop. We've already learned a ton with the present work we're doing training DMO teams. Here are a few very basic takeaways just to start explaining our process. There are obviously many more educational modules following these, ranging from predictive analytics to specific department AI training in areas like HR, finance and legal. Conduct an internal AI survey asking all staff to share their perceptions and usage of AI. Follow that up with small group interviews across the organization, and transcribe everything with an AI notetaker. We use Granola, but there are many others. Also, explain to staff that all meetings regarding AI will be recorded to create an internal knowledge base to identify opportunities, challenges and takeaways over time. Start training with a focus on just the paid/pro models of ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. Some staff feel confused with the sheer variety of available AI tools in front of them. We explain that, at the end of the day, the basics of using AI include an end user, an AI tool, and a knowledge base. Get people on board with that, and then show how most of the AI tools they have access to are similar in many ways. One of the fastest methods to advance AI understanding is showing staff how to create custom GPTs in ChatGPT. Some team members will pick up on these quickly and start integrating them into their workflows right away. These are the people who typically make up your internal AI taskforce. Explain and show how Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot are AI workhorses that connect with the majority of people's daily workflows. However, humans tend to think of those as just the next evolution of search engines. This is mental wiring that needs to be broken. Gemini and Copilot are great/good in some ways, but I've found that training staff on just those three native LLMs first (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) is more effective for seeing the light. Google NotebookLM has a lot of fans. I like to walk teams through it because it's a good way to reinforce what a knowledge base is, like we do with the custom GPTs. Also, the automated audio and video podcasts are crowd pleasers, especially with the new Join function where users can engage directly with the agentic podcast hosts. People don't seem to want to read anymore. This was a rude awakening for us when we first launched the AI Roadmap with a series of online training materials. We now know we need to deliver short video instruction if we want anyone to actually look at the educational content. People love Descript for AI-powered video creation. Once we started showing how to use Descript, we were pleasantly surprised to see how staff really leaned in. Teaching Descript provides a fun break early in the process because people can see pretty amazing results in minutes and wrap their minds around the process fairly easily. Ask all staff to share how they're using AI effectively and where they see AI failing them. Catalogue the case studies and share across the organization to accelerate learning, inspire a healthy sense of internal competition, and track learning over time. Staff members are also often wowed seeing AI agents in action. We use n8n to develop agents, where you can create a lot of basic automated workflows quickly. Once a few early adopters see how agents can take over some of their more tedious, time-consuming tasks, others will jump in. Feedback Loop & Funding/Board Support This line in the AI Roadmap is broken down into tactical internal optimization and more strategic, consumer-facing and revenue-generating sales, marketing and stakeholder engagement. I don't have a lot to share for this section and the following one because our focus to date has been mostly on the above phases. Feedback Loop The reason we record every engagement with AI Roadmap clients is to scale learning, so if one person learns something, everyone can benefit. That will be further multiplied when we starting sharing takeaways across DMOS, and eventually the industry as a whole. Visit Mesa, Tourism Richmond and Visit Florida Keys are eager to lead this initiative, and we plan to launch a new AI thought leadership framework collectively in 2026. Funding & Board Support The spark that led to developing the AI Roadmap happened almost a year ago when a board member for a large DMO told me that she viewed AI integration as merely a tactic. If this work can elevate AI in the minds of board members toward a more high-level strategic imperative, then we'll have achieved part of our mission. There's still some work to be done first though to collect more case studies showing direct AI business outcomes before we can make a more solid case for additional funding for AI integrations. AI Strategic Plan We've produced a mockup of what we think an AI Strategic Plan will eventually look like, but it's too early to show presently. For now, we've identified three overarching pillars, each with potential strategies, action items, timelines and targets. The KPIs are crucial, of course, for scaling AI strategy across the travel industry. Right now, we're thinking the three pillars might look like the following, although this is all up in the air right now: Optimize Internal Operations & Knowledge: The strategies include cleaning up internal folders/files to improve AI outcomes in general and develop AI agents specifically. A lot in here on training, experimentation, overall adoption, success measures, etc. Increase Partner Revenue with Agentic AI: Defining how DMOs develop AI agents to fuel agentic commerce is the big goal overall with the AI Roadmap. Initial strategies in this pillar begin with more low hanging fruit though, such as website redevelopment, optimizing for AI SEO, AI chat integration, etc. Expand Community Collaboration: We're seeing more DMOs take a leading role in AI education for their industry and community stakeholders. The 2050 City Roadmap is perfectly suited for informing how DMO leaders can facilitate community AI workshops and increase the organization's overall relevance and value. Greg Oates

Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Kara Franker , president and CEO of The Florida Keys & Key West tourism organization, was among the first DMO leaders to embrace AI platforms and processes in 2023 when she was chief executive at Visit Estes Park in Colorado. In May 2024, Franker published two papers on AI strategy and policy: From the Base of the Rocky Mountains to the World: A case study through Visit Estes Park’s journey into Generative AI solutions — and how your DMO can carve its own AI path Navigating AI and the Law in the Travel Industry: An Introduction to Legal Implications for DMOs The first paper highlights how Visit Estes Park integrated GuideGeek AI chat into their website and three Meta platforms: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The DMO also branded the chat Rocky Mountain Roamer to give it an identity and bit of personality. The second paper focused on AI policy and data privacy, security and compliance. Franker, who is an attorney, co-wrote that with Roxanne Steinhoff , also an attorney at Steinhoff Law, who leads the firm’s destination marketing and sports tourism practice. I caught up with Franker to see how her perspectives on AI strategy and policy are evolving almost a year later. Greg Oates: You've been leading AI strategy in tourism for almost two years beginning with your work at Visit Estes Park. However, there’s still a lack of AI training today specific for DMO CEOs, and many leaders are presently unsure how to proceed with AI. As a CEO, what’s your take on that? Kara Franker: I'm not surprised that there's a lack of training because there's just so much for everybody to wrap their heads around. I think some people are trying to watch and wait and see. My philosophy has been more of a fall-forward, fail-forward kind of approach. That's why I put the white papers out. Anybody could learn from what we had done, and do it better. You know, a case study is sometimes the best way to figure this stuff out, so that's why we did it. The second paper on AI policy was with Roxanne Steinhoff on the legal and ethical implications of AI. Because when I would go and speak in front of groups, those were always the big questions from the leadership. They don't know how far is too far once you open this can of worms. That's why we got together and started to put guardrails in place that we thought might make sense for people to study, just as a first stab at it. That all launched last summer, so I do think that there's a little bit of education out there but we could definitely use more. GO: What do DMOs need to know about AI policy at a very high level in terms of privacy and security? KF: Employee and client information should be kept private and not uploaded into any AI tools. That could be a big deal, thinking of all the different rules and regulations about collecting information, especially how it's more stringent in Europe than in the United States. That can cause potential problems if you're uploading, say, a client list that has personal cell phones, email addresses or other information that people just don't want out there. So, it's really more about information that's attached to a person. And then, is there competitive data that you don't necessarily want others to have? Possibly, but so much of what we do in the DMO space is public anyways so the lines for that are pretty blurry. I’m trying to imagine a scenario where a DMO is, like, basically hacking somebody else's information through AI. I can’t imagine that’s worth the time and effort, or even possible. GO: A few months ago we were discussing what AI tools might be available for DMO departments like HR and accounting to help with privacy, compliance, efficiency, etc. But everything available seems to be enterprise grade and out of reach for DMOs. So what’s the answer for scaling AI across an organization? KF: I think this is a huge need. I hired somebody from Cisco who’s my new VP of technology and partnerships. She's a total AI nerd like I am, and way more qualified to dive into all this. She and I have been looking at different options to put together, almost like little plugins. We really, really need this. For example, how do we take an AI solution from the legal world to analyze all our contracts so that we don't have to spend as many hours with attorneys, because we really just need a template, right? And then for HR, same thing. How do we organize all our employee files into a much more streamlined and effective system? And then there’s our policies. We're a nonprofit but everything we do is so heavily influenced by County government. We have so many compliance issues, so I want an AI to learn every single piece of County policies so we’re able to compare and contrast what we're doing with those policies. I haven't been able to find anything to help with these things. We've looked at a lot of different options but it's like what you're saying. They're these big enterprise pieces built for law firms or financial people, and they’re all really expensive. None of them fit the mold for improving different operations at a DMO. In my mind, the marketing side is covered, especially with GuideGeek, and there are so many great options now for everything involved with marketing. So I feel like that's been tackled and done really well. But for the operations, we need more. I mean, we’ve just got to keep digging deeper, I think. GO: When you and your technology person from Cisco figure all this out, will you share what you find with the rest of us? KF: Of course, always. GO: Backing up a bit, you were arguably the very first DMO CEO to lean into AI, at least in North America, when you were with Visit Estes Park. How did you convince your board that investing in AI was important at the time, and what were some of your processes with bringing along staff? KF: We were fortunate in the sense that the board was all in and the staff were all in. And I don't mean to make age a part of it, but the staff was a little on the young side and they were all very ambitious. Everybody wanted to try to figure it out. So we made the argument to the board, if we could figure out some of what AI could do, it would make the community stronger and they could take pieces of it back to their businesses. There wasn't really anybody who was against experimenting and trying it out. We made some mistakes along the way and we put that in the white paper. Also, when we first rolled out GuideGeek, which scrapes the website, we found a few holes in our content. There were particular board members who didn't have very robust information about their business, so they got a little bit mad, but not in a, like, burn it down way. It was more of, "Oh, okay, we have some work to do." So part of the AI process has to actually be community outreach. It can't just be about the technology. We have to talk to all our partners and get really robust information from them, so when the AI crawls the site it gets the best possible information about our partners. GO: One thing you did at Visit Estes Park was brand your GuideGeek AI as Rocky Mountain Roamer on your website and three Meta platforms. We use that as a case study a lot, and emphasize that a DMO should promote their AI just like any other channel, right? KF: Definitely. We knew we had to put money behind marketing the tool if we wanted people to interact with it. Traditionally with a DMO, one of your calls to action is to send people to the website. Our new call to action for a lot of our campaigns back then was to send people to the AI, so we called it Rocky Mountain Roamer to help promote and drive traffic to it. And then in terms of KPIs, we wanted to track all the interactions you can see in the backend, but not just how many people used it. We wanted to know how long people interacted with the AI, what their journey was, and what they were asking about because that’s where things get really interesting. GO: After the initial thrill of launching GuideGeek, how did you manage how staff used AI internally? Were there any incentives involved to help spur adoption and experimentation? KF: The incentive for my team was, well, it wasn't really an incentive. It was a requirement. They had to write weekly reports for me about how they tested something with AI, whatever it was. It could apply to their job or not, I didn't really care. So I almost forced them to try AI. But then people started really getting into it. They were getting more and more user friendly with different AI tools, and they would be like, “Oh, I like Anthropic because of this or that,” because they were branching out from just using ChatGPT. So, yeah, there has to be almost like a culture of AI in your DMO for it to really work, and it's on the CEO to create and foster that. Greg Oates

Join Matador Network's AI Playground at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Matador Network, GuideGeek AI and U.S. Travel are launching the inaugural "AI Playground" at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix, August 17-19. The educational space, hands-on demo area, genius bar and live sessions will run all three days during the conference. We are also producing programming specific for travel industry CEOs, along with other sessions dedicated for senior executives, highlighting actionable AI strategies focusing on real world business outcomes. Leading up to ESTO, I'll be reaching out to many of you requesting any AI-related success stories and/or questions you might have for the AI Playground. Looking back over the last two years, it's clear the industry is turning a corner in 2025 when it comes to AI learning and adoption. Many DMOs and their industry partners are now integrating AI processes and platforms across their organizations, whereas last year many destination leaders were still in wait-and-see mode. For those of you still on the fringes, it is our ambition that the AI Playground will plant a flag in the ground showing how AI is now a proven strategy for helping DMOs further deliver on their mandate. "AI is clearly powering the future of travel and how people explore the world today," says Ross Borden, founder and CEO of Matador Network. "We are stoked to be working with U.S. Travel and investing in our industry to produce the AI Playground. AI will become standard operating procedure for every DMO soon, and we're excited to help lead this journey." DMO CEOs on AI Strategy Matador launched its proprietary GuideGeek AI chat platform for DMO websites and social media channels almost two years ago. We now have more than 40 DMOs onboard, and we're expanding the scope of GuideGeek AI with new hotel groups and tour operators joing in recent months. Based on our experience working with municipal, regional and national organizations across the global visitor industry, we have unparalleled insights into how conversational AI is changing the relationship between destinations and visitors, as well as how DMOs operate internally. In preparation for ESTO 2025, we launched this GuideGeek Destination AI newsletter in January to ramp up our industry outreach and further expand our understanding of how DMO leaders are navigating the rise of AI. Here are five stories from the newsletter that inform high-level decision making related to AI strategy, with input from more than 15 CEO DMOs: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI : Our first post with 12 DMO CEOs highlighted the wide range of questions they have. One asked for the five big AI questions he should know about. Another wants practical advice on five AI initiatives that he can implement, like, tomorrow. Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism : CEO Royce Chwin, who helms Destination Vancouver, shared why his organization was one of the first DMOs in the world to dive into AI. Destination Toronto & Visit Denver CEOs on the 5 Big AI Questions in Tourism : Two chief executives, Andrew Weir in Toronto and Richard Scharf in Denver, worked out what they believe are the five big AI themes/questions that DMOs need to focus on, as touched on in the first post. Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation : Newly installed Florida Keys CEO Kara Franker, who is also an attorney, shed light on AI policy, compliance and the need for more non-enterprise AI solutions for her organization. Visit Mesa CEO Launches New DMO AI Road Map : Another visionary DMO chief executive, Visit Mesa leader Marc Garcia is bringing a new level of structure and direction for integrating AI processes and platforms. Next up, Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau, will be discussing AI strategy from a business events perspective. I also met with Cody Chomiak, vice president of marketing at Travel Manitoba, who's really lighting a fire in Canada around AI thought leadership and adoption. He'll be sharing a few powerful AI case studies from his provincial marketing organization, both internal and visitor-facing. AI Playground at ESTO 2025 The AI Playground this year will feature three stations at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge . We will have our Matador GuideGeek team and U.S. Travel staff on hand to guide participants through the space, along with some invited AI experts from around the industry. We'll be digging into a handful of paid AI models including ChatGPT Plus/Teams, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro, Google AI Pro, Microsoft Copilot Pro and Manus. We'll show how AI is best navigated at DMOs by bucketing strategy into three unique categories: Search, Create and Sales. Specific use cases will include content generation and data analysis, AI SEO and AI-optimized web development, AI policy and governance, staff adoption, building custom GPTs for sales proposals, and automated workflows and AI agents, among others. The three stations are: The Prompt Lab welcomes all attendees to come in and test drive various AI models. The interactive, hands-on learning station will have multiple laptops for experimenting with AI tools for people of all skill levels. We'll have a bunch of paid AI models pre-loaded for live demos and one-on-one conversations showing how AI actually works and some of what it accomplishes across different departments. Feel free to bring your own laptop if you like. The Genius Bar is designed for individual and group Q&A about real world AI strategy, implementation and ROI. We'll be collecting all the questions posed to share with the broader industry afterward, so we'll have a couple crowdsourcing boards to help generate new ideas and explore new solutions. Reach out to me if you want to schedule time to talk during ESTO. The AI Theater seating area will host a range of AI-focused dialogues, micro-presentations and a few dedicated sessions designed for CEOs, as well as other senior executives. The programming schedule for all those will engagements be included in the ESTO agenda. Most importantly, all the conversations at the AI Playground will highlight tangible AI case studies and specific business outcomes. The 5 Big Questions About AI One of the best things to come out of all the interviews with DMO CEOs this year is our list of the five big AI questions that chief executives need to focus on. These questions will likely evolve a bit, but for now they're providing direction for how we're developing the AI Playground and how DMOs are moving forward with AI integration. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? I would love to hear your feedback on any the above and how we can make the ESTO 2025 AI Playground as valuable as possible for you and your teams. Reach out at greg@matadornetwork.com . Greg Oates

Visit Mesa CEO Launches New AI Roadmap Aug 25 Written By Greg Oates Visit Mesa in Arizona kicked off a new internal initiative this week to integrate AI processes and platforms across the organization. I worked with Visit Mesa to help develop their new DMO AI Roadmap, which provides a 5-phase strategic framework that most any visitor organization can use as a template. The project officially began this week during Visit Mesa’s spring board meeting to communicate why the organization is moving forward with AI to optimize the DMO’s value for Mesa’s visitor industry and the local community. Marc Garcia, CATP , president and CEO of Visit Mesa, has been eager to start this initiative. He was one of the dozen CEOs who contributed to the first GuideGeek Destination AI story a few months back, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI. For that deep dive into a CEO's mindset regarding AI, Garcia asked: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” The Visit Mesa DMO AI Roadmap answers those questions. “I've recognized that AI is extremely important not only for the world moving forward, but specifically for our industry,” Garcia explained at the beginning of this project. “We at Visit Mesa need to get out in front of it. Even as a small to medium-sized DMO with our budget, we've always taken pride in the fact that we’re typically at the forefront of the latest and greatest in terms of technology, and so this is just an extension of that.” The following is a high-level overview of the DMO AI Roadmap and each of the five phases. However, like all strategic planning, there is a big jump between developing a plan and executing it effectively. This is especially true with internal AI training. In any given organization today, there is often a wide breadth of how people perceive AI and how proficient they are with AI models. It will take time to educate and align everyone around shared benefits for the organizations and staff, expected processes, intended outcomes and success metrics. Visit Mesa AI Roadmap The DMO AI Roadmap is a structured, phased approach for educating staff and integrating AI across DMO departments. The goals for the roadmap are to optimize internal operations, enhance sales and marketing outcomes, inspire staff self-learning, future-proof the organization, and contribute to how well local industry and community leaders adopt AI best practices and benefit from them. There are two imperatives that should be established and agreed upon among leadership at the very beginning. Integrating AI processes and platforms is an imperative for the DMO to ensure its relevancy and long-term impact in the local visitor economy. If leadership doesn’t fully believe that, this strategic framework won’t work. AI proficiency is an imperative for staff members for their future growth and marketability. That said, you can’t really force people to embrace, learn and use AI intentionally, but the job market will. The following phases are highly fluid and some of the processes can be rolled out concurrently. Ultimately, these phases provide structure for effectively and responsibly implementing a new technology that has no precedent. Because of generative AI, machines can now do three things they haven’t been able to do before. They have the ability to reason, the ability to communicate, and the ability to generate stuff based on that reasoning and communication. Meaning, AI is messy. Integrating it into our daily workflows is also messy because it's challenging us to rethink our relationship with technology. But as Kate Yordi, director of marketing at Visit Mesa, said during the board meeting this week, “Finally, we have some direction.” Phase 1: Leadership Alignment & Staff Communication As discussed at length in previous Destination AI posts, the DMO CEO must make it clear to all staff that the organization prioritizes AI because the organization prioritizes being relevant. It certainly helps, as is the case with Visit Mesa, when the CEO is fully backed by the board to invest in AI integration. During the board meeting, one member asked, “What do you need from us, Marc?” That’s a good sign. For the DMO AI Roadmap to work, all leadership needs to not only have a basic understanding of AI tools, they need to actually use them as well on a regular basis. That goes a long way in driving agency across the organization. However, making that happen typically requires some C-suite training to explain the primary AI models more indepth: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot and/or Google Gemini depending on the specific workplace platform(s) the organization uses. Identifying and prioritizing just a handful of AI models like that brings a lot of clarity to the process right off the bat. You see people's shoulders relax when they're confronted with 5-6 AIs versus dozens. (Yes, VEED, Gamma, Manus, Sora, Granola, Slack AI, etc., are all really cool but let's not start there.) A common lament among DMO leadership related to AI is, “Where do we even start?” Leadership should then discuss and begin to answer the five big questions all CEOs face when navigating AI integration, as vetted in the aforementioned Destination AI post about what CEOs want regarding AI education: How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI (who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI) to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and quality of work? How do we redevelop our content and channels to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI for business purposes to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The next step in this phase, at a basic level, is communicating to staff why they’re being asked to embrace AI. The following is not meant to be comprehensive, but a CEO would likely want to articulate: The purpose of the AI Roadmap, guiding principles, and the phases and processes involved How AI integration will take time and people will evolve at different paces It’s ok if everyone feels like they’re building the plane while flying it Everyone is encouraged to use AI and will be supported, but there will also be guardrails in place AI adoption and use cases will become part of employee reviews, but traditional roles, responsibilities and key success metrics are still the priority "How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents." — Marc Garcia, president and CEO, Visit Mesa Phase 2: Staff Assessment & AI Task Force Sitting down and asking staff how they feel about AI and how/if they’re using it is a good way to begin. Depending on the size of the organization, this can be done with every staff member individually or a representative group from each department. Generally people fall into three camps when it comes to AI: 1) Those who are already using AI on a regular basis; 2) those who are curious and have experimented a bit, but they don’t actively engage with AI tools; and 3) those who don’t see much value in AI. This last group can also include people who outright oppose AI, but they make themselves apparent pretty quickly. Data also shows there is often a significant percentage of staff who use AI in secret because they’re not sure they’re allowed to use it for work purposes. The second way to collect staff sentiment and AI capacity is with a blind online survey asking everyone what they like about AI, what concerns them, how they feel about job security, what they want to learn, what they hope to achieve, etc. Everything is anonymous so you can expect a wide variety of feedback ranging from constructive/optimistic to fears of an impending robot apocalypse. Once complete, all the data should be synthesized into key takeaways for leadership and shared with staff to show a high level of transparency right from the beginning of this process. The second part of this phase is developing an AI task force. The value of this cannot be overemphasized. Choose a small group of AI champions from various departments to do three things: Provide direction for stewarding the various processes in each phase as effectively as possible from beginning to end Share constructive and thoughtful input they’re hearing from other staff members about how things are proceeding well and where there are challenges Help scale AI adoption across teams by showing how they’re using AI effectively to everyone else in the organization An internal AI task force or council is invaluable because the members are motivated and they want to learn. Mostly, their enthusiasm and success with AI will begin to rub off on many of their colleagues and inspire self-learning and greater adoption among the teams. But not all. There will be those who disengage, and there can be a significant number of them. Over time, they should be consulted to understand their trepidation, which should then be addressed. This is a challenge I'm having with one organization where a significant cohort are saying they're too busy to learn AI. Meanwhile, the majority of the staff are reporting daily usage with effective results, which definitely wasn't the case a few months ago. And even with those leaning in, the level of improvement and AI Iearning will be slow at times. This is why it’s critical for the CEO and the rest of management to be all-in and consistently participate in staff training sessions to show direction, intention and support. It’s very easy for the novelty of AI training to wear off after the first few months. This is where the AI task force can be instrumental to help maintain overall staff interest and keep engagement levels as high as possible. "Finally, we have some direction." — Kate Yordi, director of marketing, Visit Mesa Phase 3: AI Policy & Investments Developing an official AI policy and governance manual accomplishes two primary objectives: It protects the organization against legal and financial liability by establishing how all employees are required to use AI responsibly. It encourages and gives license for staff to proactively experiment with AI because there are clear guidelines in place about how to do so. There are many DMOs who have created AI policies and are willing to share with the rest of the industry. These are typically not lengthy documents (3-4 pages) nor full of legalese. Generally they’re written so every single employee can understand everything in them. Sections in these policies often include: Positioning/Purpose Statement: Expresses how and why the organization needs to be intentional about implementing AI processes Primary Objectives and Intended Outcomes: Defines the business case for how the organization is attempting to deliver on its core mandate of driving revenue to local businesses in alignment with community priorities Guiding Principles: Establishes the principles of responsible AI use in alignment with the values of the organizations related to themes such as inclusivity, bias, authenticity, veracity, collaboration, knowledge sharing, etc. AI Definitions: Provides clear explanations of AI terminology used in the document and workplace AI Tools: Identifies specific AI models that the organization provides access to Data Input: Dictates clear rules about what employees can upload into AI models and what they can’t upload, such as personal information of any person Monitoring: Defines how the organization reserves the right to monitor AI practices Training & Support: Defines opportunities for professional growth and learning AI on an ongoing basis There are other items that DMOs might include in the above list, and they vary depending on how HR, financial and legal departments interpret AI governance, but it serves as a foundation. One key consideration for DMO leadership when it comes to policy is identifying which pro AI models to invest in. Paid AI tools provide higher levels of privacy and security because AI companies don’t train on them, or at least there’s the choice to select that option. Many DMOs, for example, purchase annual subscriptions for paid ChatGPT Team accounts ($25 per employee monthly) for staff to use for work, which is a first step for protecting the IP and other interests of the organization. Other paid AI models are then provided to specific departments based on need and the specific attributes of the tools, such as Claude for marketing and social media staff because many consider it the best AI for content creation. Phase 4: AI Education & Implementation This is the most important thing in training teams to embrace and use AI effectively. You want to foster an environment where structured learning evolves into self-learning. That’s the only way this scales. When staff members with little experience in AI start exploring how to use AI on their own, and they start helping their colleagues see new ways to use AI, that’s a pretty special thing. From an education standpoint, the DMO AI Roadmap begins at a high level defining AI’s place in online history. AI is the third transformational shift since the PC was invented, including: The mainstream web/internet in the 1990s; the evolution of mobile/social/cloud and apps in the 2000s; and gen AI in the 2020s. These are the only three times when big tech went all-in and pivoted their business models around a new technology. I then break AI training into the following buckets, and again, this is all very surface level and not meant to be comprehensive. Also, creating engaging demos are everything, and that's not also easy because AI demos can be a real slog sometimes. But, showing how different AIs provide real value is key for people to internalize their learning and use it more intuitively over time: Explain how pre-gen AI tech is deterministic and gen AI is probabilistic, which messes with a lot of people’s minds. Gen AI outputs are based on statistical patterns and probabilities, just like the human brain processes ideas and information. Traditional tech is based on absolutes, delivering the same output based on the same input. Old tech is about information. AI is about knowledge. Spend a lot of time on this with workshops and demos. Highlight the capabilities of only three AI models to start: ChatGPT for brainstorming and planning; Claude for writing and data analysis; and Perplexity for conversational search. The other two, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, are more general purpose. They also do amazing things (Gemini 2.5 Pro is great for reasoning), but focusing on the first three will provide direction at the beginning so people don’t get overwhelmed. At the very minimum, leadership should have a basic understanding of those three. Explain how AI search isn't 100% perfect but it's a 1,000% better than old search. Define how DMOs and all brnads are redesigning their websites and content strategy to optimize for AI search, and the basics of AI SEO . I would argue the most important thing for using AI is really understanding how generative AI = conversational AI. It's a dialogue. It's called "chat" for a reason. This is where I’ve heard the most positive feedback from teams I’ve worked with. It happens when people move beyond the Google mindset—where search is one and done—and they see the real value of iterative conversations with AI models that evolve with each exchange in the discussion, just like a human conversation. This also removes some misperceptions about how to prompt. Yes, there are some basic rules about how to prompt well. But beyond that, it’s vastly more beneficial to explore AI conversations further with thoughtful follow-up prompts that flow logically and organically to achieve the best results. Explore how the real value of AI extends beyond just efficiency and productivity gains. That's a dangerous dialogue with staff who can construe that as leading to more work or being terminated over time. The bigger value and better narrative is how AI increases creativity and knowledge, and how those both influence overall quality of work, marketing effectiveness, sales productivity, staff culture and pride, job satisfaction and growth opportunities, etc. Really dig into the advanced features of the paid models: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro. Aside from the added security and privacy they provide, they offer functions not available in the free models and their outputs are significantly better. ChatGPT Projects and custom GPTs, Claude Projects and Perplexity Spaces are where the magic happens. Create an environment where staff members are eager to share their successes with AI with the rest of the organization. This feedback loop is critical for steering education and driving adoption, and it’s one of the most important roles for the internal AI task force. AI-training meetings can be highly effective during video calls but they often have the greatest impact during in-person workshops. Also, make sure to give staff a specific amount of hours during the week to develop their AI skills. Explore options for AI chat platforms and the benefits they provide for visitors and local industry partners. I work with Matador Network, which developed the industry leading GuideGeek AI chat platform. The feedback from 35+ DMO clients is impressive and irrefutable, but there is still much work to do educating visitors and industry about AI chat strategy and their benefits to continually increase adoption and business outcomes. The DMO AI Roadmap also provides guidance for developing various learning and engagement formats: Schedule weekly or bi-weekly meetings specifically, and only, for AI training with both internal and external people sharing insights Create a library of AI educational materials for staff to reference Start a weekly internal AI newsletter to share how teams are using AI Start a Slack or similar channel dedicated for AI education, AI news updates, knowledge sharing, etc Start a weekly and optional one-hour AMA meeting for everyone to ask everyone else questions (highly effective) Create a regular schedule for staff to report back to leadership or department heads about how they’re using AI and what they’re achieving with it Phase 5: Success Tracking I kick off every AI presentation identifying the three AI models mentioned above—ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity—followed by the assertion that, "AI is the death of 'I don't know.'" That is arguably the biggest ROI for integrating AI in a DMO or any other type of organization. There are few questions that are too complex or too intimidating for DMO staff to approach with confidence and conviction if they know how to use those three AI models effectively. I shared an example previously where I used Perplexity Pro to educate myself about how board governance is evolving . That for me was something I knew was out of my realm of expertise, but now I feel I can speak with some semblance of authority about that to any board because of AI. Before gen AI, I dismissed board governance as one of those things I'd just have to leave in the dark. That said, trying to explain how AI helps staff become more self-reliant, where they can always build a foundation of understanding for anything to empower themselves, only goes so far with a board. They're looking for more quantitative KPIs. Here are just some examples of that in a DMO context. In 2025, defining KPIs for AI integration is an evolving science, and we as an industry are still figuring a lot of this out. Therefore, this list is nowhere near comprehensive and it will evolve, but we have ample data today to validate the following: Using AI for search and content development saves significant time and increases opportunities for higher output and increased creativity for producing blog posts, social media, videos, marketing campaigns, etc. Developing custom GPTs (in ChatGPT Plus) for group sales is a proven strategy for creating better, more customized proposals in much less time. That gives sales staff more time for brainstorming and prospecting leading to higher production. That's a fact. In this case, group sales people are actually pumped to try a new technology. Using AI for regression analysis and scenario modeling increases the accuracy of how DMOs predict visitor volumes year-round, event attendance, economic impact, etc. One of the biggest conversations in DMOs today is how to develop content and websites to rank higher in AI search. Developing best practices in AI SEO leads to higher traffic. That is a core mandate for any DMO, and no DMO can afford to ignore that over time. AI chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI are driving real business. As described in PhocusWire in March, New York City Tourism + Conventions launched its GuideGeek-powered "Ellis" meeting-specific AI chat in January. ROI to date: 100% increase in traffic to the meeting planner website, 800+ AI-driven queries in the first month, 50% growth in newsletter sign-ups, and 10% increase in time spent on the site. Summary The AI train has left the station and it's gaining steam. The DMO AI Roadmap is the next logical step for helping DMO CEOs and their teams integrate AI processes and platforms. As Visit Mesa's Kate Yordi said, "Finally, we now have direction." That's a big deal for DMO staff to feel that way. Generative AI has been with us for more than two years now, but a structured and phased approach for integrating AI across DMO departments has been the missing piece. Visit Mesa's DMO AI Roadmap is going to evolve as the team works through the process, but at least now there's a vision and scope. Visit Mesa CEO Marc Garcia and the board are fully committed—a critical first step for embarking on this journey. Also, this strategic framework for how DMOs approach AI is going to underpin the interactive AI Playground activation at U.S. Travel's upcoming ESTO conference in Phoenix, August 17-19. U.S. Travel and GuideGeek are partnering to develop educational programming for the hands-on AI training experience and series of thought leadership. Greg Oates

How AI Improves DMO and Community Master Planning Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Many DMOs are developing 10-year destination master plans to optimize their visitor economy in alignment with local community priorities. I've participated in producing dozens of them from Miami to Mesa. They often take as long as a year to complete because there's so much focus on community engagement in various formats: interviews, focus groups, town halls, surveys, visioning sessions, etc. The tourism industry talks about the importance of community a LOT. However, when you're working with a DMO, you never really dig into what actually moves the needle across so many endless community demands, not on a tactical and hyperlocal level. You're not really held accountable for any measure of success when it comes to community-specific initiatives, ranging from improving City Hall permitting processes for small businesses to tracking the movement of unhoused. A master plan needs to address those and amplify those kinds of pressing needs for the destination overall. The expectation is not really to fix them. That’s not the role of a DMO. It's a whole different ballgame when you're developing a long-term strategic framework for a community organization like Near Southside, Inc . in Fort Worth. Success and being accountable for fixing things is expected. Located at the periphery of the downtown core, Near Southside is the most interesting community in North America right now. The ex-industrial district can be loosely compared to Austin 20 years ago with the same cultural DNA and similar community values, based on a fiercely protective love for local, creative and independently owned small businesses. That's under threat. In the last few years, as Near Southside evolved into the coolest 'hood east and west of the Pecos Line, real estate prices are rising commensurately. We all know how this story often ends with the encroachment of national brands sanitizing the soul of a place that made it attractive in the first place. Near Southside is intent on rewriting that story. AI Processes for Strategic Planning Here's where AI comes in. Because of the multitude of overlapping challenges and evolving dynamics in the community, our team needs to crunch and debate a ton of qualitative and quantitative data. Addressing gentrification touches on so many aspects of how communities operate. Therefore, we are over-indexing on community engagement to get as many perspectives as possible to identify how the community best evolves in the face of rapid change. The amount of inputs we're getting is substantive, and we want to inventory all of it as thoroughly as possible to build a super comprehensive knowledge base for the AI to cull through, connect dots and output insights. Every individual zoom call with stakeholders is recorded with Granola AI, which produces full transcripts but the summaries are too light. So we created custom GPTs with instructions for everything we want in the summaries, including comprehensive overviews, key takeaways with detailed context for each, the most insightful quotes related to those takeaways, and all action items that stakeholders recommended. With the GPT, we can fire full transcripts into the chat, press "enter" and receive highly valuable, high quality and uniform summaries almost immediately. We're doing the same with the focus groups but the custom GPTs require a different set of instructions. The two-hour transcripts capture the conversations with 10-20 stakeholders convened across specific industry and community segments. For those, the GPTs bucket corresponding high-level takeaways and tactical action items related to the same theme. That has immeasurable value because these conversations are all over the place. It's great working with locals who are so passionate about where they live and how, but that means you're getting feedback from a firehose and someone taking notes doesn’t capture all the nuance. Using custom GPTs to produce these summaries and populate takeaways is as good or better than any team could do manually. Everything is stored in Airtable. Forget Google or Microsoft cloud platforms. Airtable is an AI-powered, relational database/spreadsheet beast for organizing data and automating basic workflows. The tables combine all project information in one place, such as a running list of pending/completed interviews and focus groups and their AI-generated summaries. Airtable can then auto-generate a summary of the summary in the same table for clients to easily review everything being collected on a daily basis to whatever degree they prefer. Once you use Airtable, you'll never look at Google Drive the same way again. I've never had so many insights so well organized, so thorough and so easy to share with a team and client to help inform each project phase. The client loves the transparency, immediacy and structure, naturally, versus waiting for the next weekly update to read a few bullet points in a PowerPoint. Here's the thing. Because we've been so intentional about collecting such a high quality and comprehensive volume of feedback, we have a motherlode of a knowledge base for AI to work with. We can then enter all that in bulk into Google NotebookLM or ChatGPT/Claude Projects to pull out anything from high-level aggregate takeaways to anything super customized or tactical. For example, the client was interested in hearing specifically just what developers had to say about gentrification. I wanted highlights related to anything discussed regarding City Hall processes. It’s super easy to pull reports together for those and anything else. Ultimately, you can use AI to deliver an outline, a strategy map and a very rough draft of a destination master plan. All you need to do is combine all of the above together, plus PDFs of all relevant public and private planning documents, PDFs of all relevant case studies and best practices, and detailed instructions about the purpose, elements, structure, etc., of the plan. People will disagree, sure. I'm not dismissing the expertise of people who put these things together, because they bring deep context to every conversation and decision made during the development of a master plan. Everything happening now in Near Southside has happened somewhere else. When you can bring takeaways from those places to any present situation, it helps provide direction for everyone in the room. Again, I’m not saying that AI is replacing humans. People get all kinds of worked up over that, especially in travel and tourism. I am saying you can create a better, more strategic and more informed master plan in a much more streamlined fashion when you employ AI strategically to better prepare a community for the future. That's just a fact. I have four more community focus groups today in Near Southside. The expectation among everyone is that their contributions will make a demonstrable difference in their neighborhood. We can’t just speak to the challenges. We need to fix them and our processes with AI are giving everyone more confidence that we can deliver on that. Wondering how many DMOs are interested in employing similar AI-first strategies to get a better handle on how to help their communities. Greg Oates

How Visit Richmond is Using AI to Sell More Conventions Aug 2 Written By Greg Oates DMO CEOs want specific use cases for AI showing how they drive measurable business results. Here's a great example for capitalizing on AI to drive meetings and conventions volume from Lauran Peoples , director of sales marketing and business development at Visit Richmond in Virginia. Peoples works in the organization's 13-person sales team and reports to the VP of sales. Her role has three core functions: She is the main liaison between the destination sales and marketing departments; she develops and leads campaign strategy for the sales department; and she works with her colleagues to optimize strategic partnerships. Peoples' role is somewhat unique as a liaison between sales and marketing in that she lives on the sales side, versus marketing. She also stands out in our industry as an emerging voice in AI innovation. If you're going to U.S. Travel's ESTO conference this month in Phoenix, look for her and me working in the show's inaugural AI Playground educational activation. Greg Oates: Can you explain your role at Visit Richmond, specifically in terms of how you bridge the sales and marketing teams? Lauran Peoples: It's becoming more common in DMOs for sales teams to have a marketing liaison, but usually that person is based on the marketing team and is mostly assigned to sales to help with creative. The issue is when that marketing liaison is based on the marketing team, they don't have much exposure to the field and what's happening out of market with your salespeople. Our sales team has 45 trade shows this upcoming fiscal year, so they're traveling almost every week. With my situation in Richmond, they're getting real-time data and downloads about what's happening in each destination, so that gives them more authentic conversations to engage planners. Not having someone assigned to a team like that creates a huge disconnect and leaves opportunity on the table. GO: Tell us a little about your journey with AI. LP: I've been working in hospitality for 20 years. Last year, I heard some younger people on the team talking about ChatGPT. So I was like, okay, I don't know anything about that. I went to PCMA Convening Leaders in January and the opening session was all about AI. I remember sitting there feeling like a dinosaur. Feeling very behind. I realized this is a lot more serious and widespread than I thought, so I left and tasked myself with using ChatGPT once a day. Initially, I couldn't differentiate how it wasn't like Google. I was asking it how many tablespoons are in this or that, kind of thing. Since then, my understanding of AI has progressively increased around more complex and comprehensive capabilities. It has streamlined my productivity, but more importantly, AI has become a thought partner for me to bounce all these ideas and scenarios around that I didn't have before. I think that a lot of people are adopting AI and using it as a communications assistant, or a writing assistant. But the part for me that's really exciting and valuable with AI is analyzing and aggregating data and getting it to show you things that you need help with, like sales. GO: Can you share an example? LP: Sure. I took five datasets: five years of lost business, five years of definite business, and three marketing reports from different campaigns we were running with outside agencies like Sojourn and Digital Edge. Those campaigns give us demographic insights because we were targeting certain areas. I also grabbed our sales deployment sheet, which tells you who has what market. I uploaded all of those into ChatGPT and asked it to identify the top five locations for each of our managers based on their market segments. Some results weren't surprising, but there were a few that popped up like Orlando that we've never traditionally considered. When I asked ChatGPT why Orlando, it showed how the city has a large hobby market. It turns out there are a lot of hobby conventions that meet in Orlando. After I compiled the top five locations for each manager, I asked ChatGPT to give me the top five accounts in each of those locations. Then I asked for unique selling propositions for each of those accounts as to why Richmond would be a perfect fit. Finally, I asked it to rank those five destinations based on probability of success. GO: Have you seen any of this result in new business opportunities? LP: Yes. One location that showed up was Philadelphia. Richmond is four hours from Philadelphia, but like Orlando it hasn't typically been on our radar. However, based on the data from ChatGPT, Philly came up as a recommendation. So we sent one of our sales managers to Philadelphia, and she ended up hosting 18 planners, including some who drove from over an hour away to see her. She got such a great response that I had to jump in and go with her because she couldn't host 18 clients by herself. AI has now informed our sales strategy for Philly, and the region is now part of our dedicated sales strategy. We've allocated funds for that sales manager in Philly to join chapters of organizations like MPI and PCMA. So that's how we know there had to be some accuracy to our approach with AI. GO: How do the sales managers feel about you doing this AI analysis? LP: They appreciate it. It's a balance because most sales managers at DMOs aren't entry level; they've been in hospitality for a long time. This is a new process and a new tool for them. Some have destinations they like to go to over and over because they're successful there. But my role is to support business enablement and sales enablement to help them do what they do better and uncover new business. So how we're using AI provides them with additional actionable research. GO: I think one of the most underrated strategies for AI is developing custom GPTs in ChatGPT to help sales teams develop more customized and effective proposals more quickly. Are you building those at all? LP: Yes, definitely. About a month and a half ago, I programmed a GPT for the sales team called "Prospecting Partner." It's trained on our sales collateral and all our information, so it knows our convention packages and understands our jurisdiction and seven localities. The sales managers have been using it to prospect smarter. I included suggested prompts to go beyond just, "Give me a prospecting email." We can get really specific, like, "Help me re-engage an association planner who just lost grant funding." It also provides strategies specifically related to that, and then you can ask how to execute those strategies. So, for example, we know from reports that finance and insurance is an opportunity market for us. It's a small percentage of our current business but it has the highest average daily rate, which makes it very attractive to our hotel partners. So our salespeople are asking ChatGPT for ways we can develop business in the finance and insurance market, and really dig into that. Ultimately, AI is helping our sales team think bigger, smarter and more strategically. I've asked the sales team if they found this helpful, and, you know, salespeople are not an easy crowd. They said yes across the board. With the ChatGPT Enterprise version, I can't see their exact prompts due to privacy, but I can see the number of conversations they're having with the tool, so I know they're actively using it. GO: How are other people on your team using AI? LP: My two direct reports are our CRM database administrator and our sales coordinator. My sales coordinator does support work for the entire team, so she's using ChatGPT a lot for ideation, like when a sales manager needs an itinerary to entertain clients in Chicago. My CRM database administrator uses ChatGPT as a communication assistant because sometimes analytical personality types can benefit from exploring more communication nuances. She's also started incorporating it into data cleanup, using it to analyze reports and suggest what's missing or what would be beneficial. She uses it to help fill in gaps and identify what's not being asked or said. GO: What are some of your future plans with AI? LP: We're launching microsites for destination sales and sports, and I think it will set a model for the rest of the organization because we’re replacing our website from pre- to post-AI, like most DMO sites these days. We're currently writing copy for the microsites, and I've been getting into structured data and semantic clarity. You don't search ChatGPT or prompt ChatGPT with the same language you search Google, so content has to be written differently. Previously, you'd go to Google and say "restaurants near me." Now with ChatGPT, it's more of a conversation, so you'll say, "Hey, I'm in Scott's Addition historic district in Richmond with my kids, and we're looking for a vegan restaurant." That semantic clarity allows AI to respond with much more specific answers. I think we need to anticipate AI searches, as opposed to Google searches, in how we write content. Everyone is subconsciously expecting a personally curated experience today. When I go on Amazon, I'm expecting it to make connections that I like this, so I might also like this, without me having to tell it certain things. That's where we have to move towards, or we get eclipsed or become obsolete, especially if we're just thinking of ourselves as brokers for a destination. Greg Oates

Visit Phoenix CEO on Leading AI Strategy and Being Chill About It Jul 28 Written By Greg Oates I learned a lot about how DMO leaders can confidently integrate AI processes into their organizations after speaking with Ron Price, CDME, president and CEO of Visit Phoenix. Price is somewhat new to AI but his staff have been doing cool things with various LLMs for a while. He says his primary role with AI is providing the Visit Phoenix team with an enabling environment for success built on a culture of trust. Price accomplishes that by inspiring everyone to experiment with AI, be aware of the liabilities, share their wins, have fun with it, reach out to others for advice, and most of all, validate everything. Although, what stood out for me the most talking with Price is his calm and clear approach to AI, basically inferring (in my words, not his)... "We got this. We might do something amazing today with AI or we might not, but either way we're fully committed to seeing what it can do. We're also going to figure this AI thing out by collaborating with our many DMO industry friends. Because AI is going to change everything in a hurry, and we at Visit Phoenix are not going to be caught staring out at a Sonoran sunset while the world passes our city by." That's the vibe I got. That's leadership. That's what being a CEO means, at least for me. AI is confusing, sure, and CEOs have to worry about their boards and electeds. The thing is, we're more than two and a half years into generative AI now, and it's not going to wait for CEOs to decide if they can "trust AI" or not. I think we can all learn from Price a few things: We can de-escalate all the hubris and hand-wringing surrounding AI by being open to possibilities and having a clear set of principles, especially related to responsible AI use and verification. You can have fun with AI and focus on business outcomes at the same time. The DMO industry needs to collaborate and share best practices more intentionally to accelerate AI education, innovation and integration. We must encourage DMO staff to use AI today so they can steer the future of our industry tomorrow. Price likes talking about AI. I would encourage any DMO CEOs on the fence with AI to reach out to him. Greg Oates: Ron, how do you use AI? Ron Price: I use AI every single day, going back now about a month and a half. I'm just fascinated and interested in what it's able to do. I wouldn't say I'm an early adopter, of course, although there are some people who aren't even on it yet. Me personally, I use it for everything, like if I'm curious about something that's happening within the region. Or maybe I want to quickly compile a lot of data to help solve a problem or answer questions as I get ready for different meetings. More or less, my brain is always just firing, like, "What if we tried this or that?" And so, this year has been a cool realization about what AI can do, and seeing how it's pulling all the sources through to validate what it responds with. We have also integrated AI with Microsoft Copilot. We pay for everyone to have access to that, and then we also have a ChatGPT Team account for our staff. GO: Where else are you seeing value with AI at Visit Phoenix? RP: In our world, it's marketing, it's content. I love being surrounded by people who can write really well. It's an art to me, and I don't possess that art. It's like someone playing the piano. I'm in awe of that. So AI gives people the ability to write better, and it's okay to lean into it. Don't feel threatened by it. AI is able to give you that one golden nugget, or it suggests that one good idea that can really help someone when they're writing. Here's the fun part. Every day, we're learning something unique. We have the Cronkite School of Journalism in Phoenix, and some of the students are here. We kind of give them free rein, and we're also teaching them at the same time. The way that they use AI is amazing. It's fun to walk down the hall to see them because I'm always like, "How did you write that? How did you create that image? How did you pull that data and research together?" It's just a different generation. We're also seeing where our people are asking AI things like, "If I'm a salesperson, how do I influence a group to come here in the middle of the summer for a conference? Why is it fun to be here for a conference when it's 110 degrees out?" And what does AI have to say? Well, one thing that's great about, say, Grok, for example, it's pulling from all these little texts on Twitter, or X. They're from people saying, "Hey, I know it's summertime in Phoenix but look what I got to do." Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use. GO: Does your staff using AI increase your organization's impact in the community? RP: We not only focus on growing tourism in our community, but we're also joined at the hip with economic development. We look at our role as we're here to build a better community through tourism. And so, when you think about utilizing all the data out there, we always ask ourselves, "How could AI help us consolidate that data and crunch the numbers faster to give us a clearer picture of what we think we know?" For example, how much business that comes in through our leads touch our priority sectors? And of those sectors, which ones align extremely well with what we're doing here at Visit Phoenix? Is it semiconductors? Is it bio-med? Is it something that leans into the engineering side because of what ASU and the Department of Defense are doing? We've seen we can go back and look at the data and get a better picture of those things now. Also, as an example, we have a high propensity to book business around the semiconductor space. So we're utilizing these AI tools to quickly do research like, "Give me a list of the top semiconductor conferences that take place around the world." The responses are quicker and the results are better versus doing a traditional Google search. It's able to pull from a lot of different sources, so that's another way we're using AI. “Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use.” GO: How do you define the role of a CEO to guide a DMO forward with AI? RP: Setting up the rules of the game is important. There are areas of liability we have to be aware of about what you can and can't be pulling in. Those are the types of things we needed to figure out, you know, basically, "What is our rule book for using AI?" I like giving people the ability to use AI as they will. I think it works best whenever people know that it's a tool we want them to utilize. And if it can help us at the end of the day tell a better story, be smarter as we go after business, and be smarter with our analytics to help build our marketing strategy stronger, then use it. I try to build a team of leaders so they're CEOs of their own divisions, and I want them to be thought leaders in their areas. Also, I think AI enables us to get to answers quickly, but, and this is important, how do we validate those answers? We're really good at Visit Phoenix when it comes to validating answers, but we're usually doing it by going the long way and understanding how AI responded like it did. We're reading source by source by source, and then we kind of come to our own conclusion. It's like we're not just focused on the punch line of a joke. We can also tell you the structure of the joke. You always have to validate. We get excited about using AI because it just puts us in a new position. I think it's good to have a CEO that supports that, but that support comes from a trust within the organization. I trust that people are going to utilize AI to help make us better. GO: What keeps you up at night regarding AI? RP: My fear is how do we control and ensure that someone isn't producing something negative on our behalf, and then launching it to the world, and using this incredible tool to hurt us? Because there are people that are extremely gullible who believe whatever they're looking at. That's kind of where my brain goes sometimes. It's only because of what I've already seen these tools can do. I think across the DMO industry, we'll have some "ahas," especially when we get together in various forums to exchange ideas. We need to be talking with each other about, "Here are some things that work really well with AI, and here are the headwinds." And then, "These are the things you need to realize could happen with AI, and here are some ways you can mitigate those problems." The more we can learn from others about how they're using AI, the better. I think what you're putting together about AI strategy with all your insights is going to be extremely valuable. GO: Thank you. So, what are you thinking about next with AI? RP: As AI continues to grow, and we've talked about it here internally, what is the value of a website? In fact, we just started our next fiscal year, July 1. Website visits is no longer a key metric that we're going after. As a leader, I like knowing what's three steps ahead. We currently have these tools, but how are they going to change the way we make decisions going forward? At some point, a lot of what we're talking about now is going to be white noise. And what then? It doesn't mean our jobs of promoting a destination change. It means we're going to get so much better at telling our story through so many different avenues. I believe that our reach is actually going to broaden. We're still going to be responsible for promoting our destination and selling our destination, but how we tell the story and how we show the story is going to change as these tools evolve. Back in the day, a lot of us were reading about Moore's Law and how things just keep improving and getting cheaper, especially in technology. Now we're moving into a space where the rate of growth with AI is going to be something we've never seen before. Greg Oates

German Convention Bureau Leader on the Future of AI-Powered Meetings Jul 27 Written By Greg Oates After the global financial crisis ended in 2011, a few cities and nations around the world began promoting themselves to meeting and convention organizers based on their intellectual capital, versus venues and attractions. Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau (GCB), led this strategy in Europe at the time. Around the same year, I was visiting the House of Logistics & Mobility (HOLM) think tank in Frankfurt. The GCB suggested I visit there to better understand this new direction for attracting high-value business events in advanced industries. "The city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," Dr. Stefan Walter told me, who was a professor at HOLM at the time. "So, this [GCB] strategy is about finding the strengths of our strengths, our core competencies, and for Germany, that’s knowledge and infrastructure. It’s also about connecting ideas.” That has been my due north working in the travel industry ever since. This idea that meeting planners and attendees can tap into a deep knowledge base in a host destination, specific to their interests, for me, is intoxicating. The challenge is it takes a ton of work connecting local leaders in specific advanced industries, like aviation in Frankfurt or e-mobility in Stuttgart, with large global organizations in those same industries and convince them to bring their big annual event to Germany. It's also pretty high level. From an attendee standpoint, if I'm in Hamburg and want to learn about HafenCity, the largest urban makeover in Europe, it's not like I can easily access a bunch of people and organizations leading the future of urban development. Which, would be cool, right? AI is helping make that a reality. Germany's national Open Data/Knowledge Graph project is an ambitious AI-powered initiative to build a massive network of industry suppliers, academic organizations and business leaders across the country. Basically, by indexing the visitor industry and intellectual capital supply chain, Germany can connect the brightest minds in Germany with the rest of the world more seamlessly, effectively and equitably. An "interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," if you will. I spoke with Mr. Schultze to learn more about how AI is impacting the meetings and convention industry in Germany. Greg Oates: How is AI evolving across Germany's visitor industry? Specifically, how are your municipal CVBs and other partners thinking about and using AI right now? Matthias Schultze: Like much of the world, things really accelerated for us around two years ago with the rise of tools like ChatGPT. Suddenly, everyone, from corporates to associations, started thinking seriously about AI. We saw an opportunity and created an innovation platform called ebx.lab . It’s a peer-to-peer learning community for event planners, where we partner with scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute to explore how AI might reshape the business events space. From those early sessions, we have published a few white papers and identified a few core insights. AI clearly has potential to personalize experiences, optimize event planning processes, improve engagement and networking, and maybe most exciting, support predictive analytics. That last one, especially, being able to anticipate trends or behaviors based on data, is what feels most transformative to me personally. GO: How is the GCB embracing AI internally? MS: We developed our own internal AI strategy for the German Convention Bureau. We wanted to give both our team and our stakeholders a shared framework, something that outlined where we are today, where we want to go, and how we get there. It’s called "Driven by People, Powered by Data," and that title really reflects our belief that AI is a tool, not a solution in itself. People need to lead the process. The strategy helps us clarify not just what we can do with AI, but also what we can’t or shouldn’t do, at least not yet. It outlines our roadmap and aligns everyone across our organization and membership. GO: Is that strategy available publicly? MS: Yes, though only in German for now. But with the right AI tools, you can translate it quickly. The strategy touches on everything from marketing and communications to event planning, workflow automation, customer personalization, sustainability, and even ethics and compliance. The ethics component is particularly important. As exciting as AI is, we have to keep guardrails in place. Within our organization, we’re working hard to ensure that AI isn’t something siloed or limited to leadership. It needs to be embedded across every level. Everyone in the organization is expected to develop basic AI literacy. We’ve also worked on minimum viable products for things like dashboards and customer-facing chatbots. Some are already in use today. GO: You've always been a strong and vocal proponent for sustainability in business events. How is AI supporting you there? MS: I’m very proud of a project we developed with 29 other European countries: the Sustainability Hub for Events . It’s an AI-driven platform that brings together all kinds of sustainability related data—certifications, guidelines, best practices—and makes them accessible through an interactive AI agent. Planners can ask things like, “Can you help me build a sustainable menu?” or input event details to estimate their CO₂ footprint. It’s highly practical, and it’s making a real difference for event planners who need fast, reliable and actionable sustainability information. GO: We've talked about your Open Data and Knowledge Graph project in Germany numerous times in the past. Is that now live? MS: It’s technically live but still in progress, and probably always will be, in a sense. We’re continuously expanding it. The Open Data Germany project by the German National Tourist Board is live with its Knowledge Graph. The Open Data MICE project, which is implemented in close cooperation with the GNTB, is not yet live. One exciting element launching soon is an interactive map of research institutions in Germany. It will show where key research and innovation is taking place, including medical tech, renewable energy and so on, and link that data to infrastructure like hotels and conference venues. The idea is to visualize Germany as a knowledge landscape. If you’re planning an event and you want to anchor it around a theme like urban mobility, the map will show you which regions are most active in that field and match you with the relevant venues and experts. GO: One theme I keep obsessing about, and it's felt like a bit of a fantasy for more than a decade, is that the city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine. That idea is a direct quote from your House of Logistics and Mobility in Frankfurt, and it’s stuck with me ever since I heard it back in 2011. It's this idea of a city as a platform. Do you think we're getting closer to executing on this idea, where innovation at all levels is more accessible and shareable for more people? Ultimately what we're talking about here is the democratization of knowledge and excellence. MS: I love that idea. I really do. I think there are two layers to it. On one level, we have the smart city movement with systems that integrate transportation, energy, data and infrastructure to make better decisions. That’s already happening in many places across Europe. But on a deeper level, regarding your fantasy.... Let's say you could land in Munich, be interested in urban tech, and immediately connect with people, events and institutions aligned with that interest—that’s becoming possible too. The data already exists. It’s just scattered. But with open data standards, machine readability, and the right AI tools, we can start connecting those dots. Your fantasy city may not be so far off.

A CEO's Playbook for AI Integration Oct 10 Written By Greg Oates Your competitors are talking about AI. Your board is asking about AI. Your partners want to see your AI strategy. Many DMOs are debating the potential of AI, while an increasing number of others are already extracting real business and organizational value. The difference isn't budget or technical talent. It's knowing exactly where to look for opportunities and how to scale what works. 3 Non-Negotiables You Must Lead This, Not Delegate It: AI transformation dies in committee. The organizations seeing real results have CEOs who champion specific initiatives, remove bureaucratic friction, and signal that AI adoption is a strategic priority. This doesn't mean micromanaging prompts. It means creating air cover for teams to experiment and fail fast. Complex Impresses, Simple Delivers: Your instinct will be to pursue the flashy, sophisticated AI applications that sound impressive in board presentations. Resist it. The organizations generating real ROI start with mundane problems: expense report processing, meeting summarization, competitive monitoring, etc. These boring use cases build organizational confidence and create the foundation for more ambitious projects. Your People Know Where the Problems Are: The best AI applications emerge from the intersection of daily frustration and technological possibility. Run hackathons. Create cross-functional workshops. Ask your teams what they do that feels like waste. The solutions they surface will be more practical and impactful than anything your consultants recommend. Start Here Stop looking for AI opportunities everywhere. Focus your organization's attention on three specific areas where AI creates immediate, measurable value. The Tedium Tax: Every role in your organization includes mind-numbing tasks that consume time without creating value: data entry, compliance documentation, procurement reports, staff vacation tracking, etc. Think of these as your "Anti To-Do List." These are tasks systematically eliminated by asking, "How can I never have to do this again?" Your teams are paying a tedium tax every day. AI is the refund. The Expertise Bottleneck: Projects stall when teams hit the limits of their skills and wait for other departments. Marketing needs data analysis and campaign design mockups. Finance and HR need custom GPTs. Sales needs meetings-related technical specifications translated into customer language. AI breaks these bottlenecks by giving every team superpowers they never had before. The Blank Page Problem: Knowledge work involves ambiguous challenges where the path forward isn't clear: Strategy development, market analysis, problem diagnosis, etc. AI excels at generating multiple approaches, analyzing incomplete information, and proposing next steps when your teams are stuck. It's the thinking partner that's always available and never runs out of ideas. 6 Use Cases OpenAI's analysis of 600+ successful implementations across various industries reveals that virtually every valuable AI application falls into one of six categories. Show your teams these six use cases and they'll start finding opportunities everywhere. Content Creation: Use AI for first drafts of everything: strategy documents, marketing campaigns, product and experience descriptions, customer and community communications. AI maintains your brand voice while eliminating the blank page problem. Research and Synthesis: AI powers information gathering at superhuman speed, including market analysis, competitive intelligence, customer feedback synthesis, regulatory research, etc.. AI doesn't just find information. It structures it exactly how you need it for decision-making. Coding for Everyone: Your non-technical teams can now write Python scripts, SQL queries, and data visualizations. Your engineering teams debug faster and prototype in unfamiliar languages. AI democratizes technical capability while accelerating your experts. Data Analysis Without Degrees: Upload spreadsheets, dashboard screenshots or raw data files and get structured analysis without requiring PhD-level statistics knowledge. This is arguably the most undervalued opportunity that delivers immediate results for most DMOs. Strategic Thinking Partner: AI is a beast for brainstorming, scenario planning, product and event development, asset mapping, risk analysis, etc. AI helps structure complex problems and identifies considerations your teams might miss. This is my favorite use case for AI. Intelligent Automation: Use platforms like n8n, Relay and others to create repeatable processes that run themselves, such as weekly competitive updates, financial reporting, sales and marketing workflows, a ton of admin duties, etc. Create the process once, then let AI handle the execution while humans focus on exceptions and strategy. Implementation is Where DMOs Fail Most AI initiatives fail because organizations treat them like traditional software deployments. They're not. AI is about change management and behavioral transformation up and down the org chart. AI implementation requires different approaches to discovery, prioritization and scaling. Systematic Opportunity Hunting: Don't wait for AI use cases to emerge organically. Run structured discovery sessions where teams audit their workflows for repetitive tasks, skill bottlenecks, and ambiguous challenges. Make this process ongoing, not a one-time exercise. The Impact-Effort Matrix: Not every AI opportunity deserves attention. Prioritize based on business impact versus implementation effort. Quick wins build momentum. High-value, high-effort projects become strategic investments. Everything else gets parked until technology makes it easier. Innovation as Culture: Internal competitions accelerate discovery while building AI literacy across your organization. The goal isn't technical sophistication. It's practical business solutions that teams actually want to use. Measure What Matters: Track time saved, accuracy improved, costs reduced and capability expansion. But also measure qualitative impacts: employee satisfaction, process improvements, competitive advantages. Use this data to guide scaling decisions. Build Your AI Process Move beyond random experimentation to systematic capability building. I like Estée Lauder's 5-phase process to ensure repeatable success with AI. Does this resonate with you for your DMO? Design: Define your purpose, scope and success criteria for AI integration in a 2-page brief. No scope creep. No technical complexity for its own sake. Prepare: Ask department heads to gather relevant data and best practices. AI tools should reflect organizational knowledge, not generic approaches. Build and Test: Hire contractors where necessary to help teams develop automations/agents, implement training, integrate datasets and validate accuracy. Focus on usability, not just functionality. Launch: Deploy with user guides and change management support. Technology deployment is easy. User adoption across all departments is a total headache at first. Optimize: Feedback loops drive continuous improvement based on actual usage patterns. AI applications evolve with business needs and improved capabilities. Key Insight: Always start with fundamental questions: Why build this? What problem does it solve? What impact will it have? Is the measurement for success quantitative or qualitative? Organizations that answer these questions clearly will build more successful AI applications than those focused primarily on technical capability. Build AI-Native Workflows The most sophisticated implementations integrate AI across entire business processes rather than individual tasks. This evolution positions organizations for the agentic AI capabilities coming next. Process Decomposition: Break complex workflows into constituent tasks, identify where each AI use case category adds value, and create integrated approaches spanning from research through execution. Marketing workflows might integrate research for market understanding, analysis for opportunity mapping, ideation for strategy, content creation for product and destination development, and automation for distribution. Cross-Functional Integration: AI facilitates better collaboration by translating between departments. Technical specifications become marketing language. Customer requirements inform sales priorities. Financial models drive strategic planning. Future-Proofing for Agents: Current workflow integration prepares your organization for AI agents that can complete entire projects independently. Teams that understand how to break processes into AI-addressable components will leverage these capabilities immediately when available. The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done. This cognitive shift creates advantages that compound over time and become increasingly difficult for competitors to replicate. "The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done." Key Takeaways The question isn't whether AI will transform our industry. It's whether you'll be leading that transformation or reacting to it. Start with clear, achievable use cases and systemic approaches to build the organizational muscle needed for transformation. AI advantage isn't about having the most technical teams or biggest budgets. It's about developing capabilities for organization-wide discovery, adoption, implementation and scaling of practical business solutions. The organizations moving beyond experimentation to systematic implementation today will be best positioned to leverage the more sophisticated AI capabilities emerging tomorrow. The agents are coming. Will you be ready? Greg Oates

The ROI of AI Agents Aug 21 Written By Greg Oates Based on a bunch of conversations at DI Annual 2025 this month, it's clear that many DMO executives still equate generative AI primarily with writing and editing in ChatGPT. But as one COO of a large U.S. DMO told me, "Surely there's more to all this than just learning about prompting." So many ways to respond to that. Meanwhile, there are also DMO leaders who established AI road maps for their organizations going back two years. For them, they're increasingly focused on developing AI-powered automated workflows and their more sophisticated cousins, AI agents. The purpose of these synthetic workflows is to automate tedious, time-consuming and repetitive tasks to free up staff to focus on more high-value work. Think of it as an evolution from using AI to building AI. You begin by visually mapping what people do in your organization. Then you identify where AI can potentially take over all the mundane stuff better and faster. I’ve been working with my colleagues at Matador Network to develop automated workflows for our Studio team. We have endless terabytes of client video created during the last 10 years. Now, with AI, we want to capitalize on those existing assets to create new video, but first we need to use AI to understand what we actually own. We contracted Erick Bonilla , founder of Pocho.tech based in Uruguay, to build a series of new AI workflows in n8n. One of the automations is designed to cull through 10 years of video files in Dropbox and catalogue everything in Airtable. The AI then creates standardized file names, project IDs, links for raw edited videos and finished client hero/cutdown videos, and location and content tags. The cost to develop the AI workflow was about $2,000 all-in, and it saved more than a month of work at a mid-level manager salary. The beauty of automations/agents is you can measure ROI annually fairly easily, which will help wake up your board if they're sleeping on AI. Moreover, once an automation is in place, the savings will continue to accrue in the future indefinitely for tasks still required, and there’s zero human error. During a staff Zoom, I asked members of our Studio team if they felt these new agents signaled to them the beginning of the end of some people’s jobs. The response was unanimous. Nobody wants to do this type of repetitive grunt work. I spoke with Bonilla for his take on the future of AI agents. Greg Oates: Erick, what services does Pocho.tech provide? Erick Bonilla: We identify opportunities within organizations of all sizes, where we believe implementing AI systems can dramatically improve the efficiency of operations. We can create workflows that process data, or we can create AI agents capable of reasoning, analyzing data, creating reports, and providing decision-makers with an enhanced way of digesting information. I have been doing this for almost two years, working with people mostly in the Middle East, the US and Latin America. The Pocha company site is brand new as I try to expand in the world of AI. GO: What’s the difference between automated workflows and agents? EB: A workflow is like a mass production factory. It's a set of operations that work through specific logic to automate a repetitive process that a human has done before. This could be writing and reading emails, writing summaries, reformatting and transferring content through different tools and applications, etc. An AI agent is a thinking environment that makes decisions for you. You can set a workflow for reading your emails. But then you can have an AI agent that summarizes your emails and tells you, if you have 10 emails, what those 10 emails are about in just one email, SMS text, WhatsApp message, Google doc or whatever. GO: So an AI agent has more autonomy and decision-making capabilities than an automated workflow? EB: Definitely. The AI agent is capable of being completely autonomous to make decisions within a given context. You give it a context with defined restrictions that narrows the scope of the decisions it can make. GO: Can you provide any success stories where you worked with a client who had a specific challenge, and you created an automated workflow or agent that successfully delivered a solution? EB: The most recent example is an EdTech company in Boston that provides a training and placement program for clean energy jobs. They've been operating for the past five years, but there’s been a lack of funds, employees and program applicants to scale beyond Massachusetts. So they decided to use AI and automation to build flows without having to invest a lot of money in hiring people. What I did was streamline the application process for people interested in entering the educational program. We created a form and a workflow that takes the information from the application and puts it into an application tracking system. This system has workflows that can trigger emails, daily reports, weekly reports and invitations to interview. Then I created an AI agent. Once the applicants are interviewed by a human, we take the transcript of that, analyze it using AI, and build a report for the decision maker so they can decide if this person is capable of entering the program or not. We also created a scoring system. We built it based on human criteria, which is subjective, and then we converted that into an objective dataset so we could classify people and score them based on numbers. All of this is done by an AI agent that sets a score for the applicant at the end of the interview. Then we have a leaderboard where people are ranked, and the top 15 get into the education program and placement process. GO: Were they happy with the end result? EB: Oh yeah, very happy. Here's where the beauty and magic come in. Now the CEO can envision a way of expanding outside Massachusetts, and tell her team, "Hey, we're going to New York!" Where before, she thought she needed to hire more people in each new state to oversee the operation. And, because an AI agent works 24/7, she doesn't have to wait until 8am to get a report or transcription, or anything anymore. So now, she can think about how to scale her company more successfully without having to hire more people. GO: What's the road map looking ahead? Where are you going with the company in terms of next steps? EB: We're trying to create an outreach system because the purpose of the company is not only to train people but also to place them in clean tech job positions. The outreach system is going to help the team find more companies with open positions, so the company can place more people in those positions. We’re building a system involving AI agents and workflows where we're going to take a picture of all the open positions and analyze and understand them using AI. We want to know, what are the requirements in terms of learning and knowledge capacity for people to get in these positions, so the company can build a better training program. GO: What was the biggest challenge working with them? EB: I think the most important one, and this is something anyone working on this will experience, is the resistance of some team members who don't trust the performance of AI enough. People who have low experience working with AI, and maybe only know ChatGPT, will look at this and say, "I don't believe this can work." So that means there’s a lot of educational work. People need enough knowledge about what AI tools are capable of to suggest what can and can’t work. I think that's the main challenge. But once people see it working, they start to lean into AI. Suddenly, they become like, "This is great. Can you add this other metric? Can you make it do this other thing too? Can you make me one for my personal side hustle?" It's interesting when you see people moving from resistance to acceptance. GO: Working with you has firmly cemented something I've been preoccupied with this year. It's this: One of the most exciting things about AI, which is giving us more time back during the day, requires the most boring thing, which is having uniform file and data structure. As we've discovered together only too well, AI can't reach its full potential unless you have everything structured super cleanly. The analogy I often use is that AI is like an 8-year-old savant. The person is brilliant but he or she often needs really consistent environments and clear guardrails, or things go sideways or just crash. Can you talk about what any organization needs to focus on when it comes to file and data structure? EB: I think one of the most basic things, and I'm living this with a company I'm helping right now, is documenting files and folders exactly the same. You must set protocols for everything when you’re building a folder system to store content and data. That's one of the biggest challenges for companies trying to implement AI automation with poorly standardized systems. When we didn’t have AI a few years ago, we didn't think of a machine reading our documents or files. We never thought that could be possible, so we never really focused on creating really good file structure. The biggest challenge for companies, coming back to Matador, is how to organize the field of play so that AI doesn't struggle. We easily lose the excitement of implementing AI in an organization when an AI is trying to navigate a maze of poorly organized files. For that, you need to build SOPs that tell everyone on the team, “We're going to be naming files this way now so that a 5-year-old can read the titles and understand what's in every one of them. Because if a 5-year-old can read this set of folders and understand what's inside all of them, then AI can do that too. And if AI can find and read everything, then AI can do some truly amazing things and save companies a lot of money. GO: So how are organizations like ours, which have been in operation for a long time, supposed to go back decades and reorganize all our files? EB: We can run a workflow that can do that for you. That's where the ROI comes in. You can make a one-time investment building a workflow that's going to completely standardize all your filing and foldering. But if you do that, you have to know that the ROI might not show up right away. It's going to start paying off later in terms of the time, money, stress and everything it’s going to give back. A CEO must understand that the return on that investment is going to be ongoing through the years, not in the next quarter necessarily. If you have that mentality, then your company is going to become AI-first. GO: You’ve told me before that AI is not a tool, it's a culture. Can you explain that? EB: Right now, the biggest obstacle for AI expanding in many companies are the CEOs. I understand the challenges because they fear a lot of reputational risk. You have a board and customers that are going to be judging you. If you don't have a very good AI road map, then it could turn into a failure, and the fingers are going to be pointing at you. I understand that completely. But AI should be a culture within companies, and that starts top down because the CEO has to embrace trial and error. AI is going to fail at least during the first time you start with any automation. It's like when you're building a prompt. We were talking the other day, and you said using AI is not about writing the perfect first prompt. It's that fifth or sixth prompt that's going to get you to the right answer. You're going to be iterating with automation, too. That's something CEOs have to transmit throughout the organization. GO: I think for many tourism organizations, we haven’t even begun talking about the big picture value of AI. From an internal perspective, for example, agents offer a whole new level for optimizing operations with AI. EB: Yes, exactly. When we're in a company and we're facing challenges, the first intuitive thinking is, "How can I solve this? I'm going to Google it.” Now we're transitioning to, "How can I solve this? I'm going to ask ChatGPT.” This is great, but that's not AI-first. That's changing one tool for another. You're still browsing. It's literally the same thing. You're not really using AI. AI-first means, "I do this thing that's consuming 10 hours a week. I do the same thing every time. I spend two hours every day doing the same four steps. How can I use AI to automate this?" That's AI-first because you're using AI to stop wasting time. I think that's the culture we should be striving for. If a CEO injects the whole company with that mindset, then the employees are going to eventually use AI to solve their issues more independently and autonomously. At the end of the day, what AI really does is gives us more time and more of our lives back, and we have not yet understood that because it's new. But it's true, AI is the way for humans to have more life. GO: I want that. EB: We all do. GO: I have this belief that eventually, in any organization, all meetings will be recorded and deposited into a central knowledge base where an AI can summarize everything and connect all the key takeaways. I might have a meeting and someone on the other side of the world has a meeting, and the AI will know we're talking about the same thing. It will see and surface how there's potential opportunity to connect our efforts. It's like one plus one equals three, or more. Do you think that's where we're going and that it will benefit companies? EB: Definitely. It's the most common sense thing to do, but I know it's also counterintuitive because there are many people who would not like to have all conversations recorded. The fidelity, the accuracy of the information, and it all being in one place and uniformly structured, is everything. You can have thousands of conversations and tell the AI, "Go here and search for this specific idea in all the transcripts where we have talked about that." You just need to build the SOPs. Then a human can quality control it and say, "This is right. This isn't right. Maybe we can tweak this, or build on that." GO: I’ve experienced this firsthand where people are vehemently against this idea of all company meetings being recorded. For many it portends that clichéd dystopic future we see in science fiction, where everything's controlled and you have no freedom, right? EB: I can see it too. We must remember that these tools can be turned off. If we let the technology control us, then that's on us. I think at the end of the day, it's about how do you balance the risk and rewards? This is something CEOs are used to. Do you prefer to live in blindness and have an uncompetitive company because you decided not to take that risk with automation? Or do you take the risk and have everything recorded, even though some people are going to say it’s Orwellian in a way, and even though ultimately it's going to improve everybody's life? We have to find that balance, and that’s the CEO’s role to determine what’s best overall for the company, customers and employees in the future. GO: Any last thoughts? EB: I think we are not quite there yet to know for sure the amount of ROI that is going to come from agents and automations. Definitely it is going to be positive ROI. For that, I'm completely sure. What I'm not sure is how do we measure ROI based on the anticipated lifetime value of the process? So much is changing so quickly and it's difficult to see the future. As the tools get better, then the workflow gets better too, so the ROI increases, right? Except, we don't really have models for that. For CEOs, I think, they have to try to envision how they can measure the value of automations now, and how that might evolve exponentially in the future. Greg Oates

What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates CEOs at destination marketing and management organizations (DMOs) are seeking AI guidance specifically tailored to their chief executive roles. A CEO in the U.S. told me recently that current AI education is often too surface level, vague, unstructured, or trying to cover too much ground to be useful for a chief executive. He said, "We've been talking for a while now about how we need AI education targeting leadership, but it doesn't really exist." While destination leaders face many more questions about AI than answers, one thing is 100% clear: CEOs must own and lead their organizations' AI integration across all departments. AI isn't something to outsource or delegate to others, and it's not a "marketing thing" for the CMO to figure out. Conor Grennan , chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, consults with clients on AI strategy from JPMorgan to NASA. I asked him how important it is for CEOs to lead AI education, adoption and integration across their organizations. “CEOs have to understand how to use AI and why; they really have to have felt the delight about what AI can do,” he said. "They also have to see clearly how AI is a leadership and change management challenge, not a tech challenge. Then they need to start out being vulnerable, and be able to say, ‘Hey, I was skeptical about AI. I didn’t understand it, either. But now I can explain the way I learned it and how to communicate why it’s important to help other people understand it.” So why do CEOs need to understand AI? Jeff Bezos answered that at The New York Times DealBook Summit last year. He described how “modern AI is a horizontal enabling layer" that will soon be integrated into every device and digital application in existence. "These kind of horizontal layers like electricity and compute and now artificial intelligence, they go everywhere," he said. "I guarantee you there is not a single application that you can think of that is not going to be made better by AI." Here's the clip: Strategic AI Approaches I met with about a dozen CEOs in North America to find out what they want to know about AI specifically from a CEO perspective. Some leaders are seeking big-picture guidance with a broad overview of high-level strategy. "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” one CEO told me. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" Another chief executive said, “We see three areas of opportunity for AI: Administrative tasks and general productivity; marketing chat, SEO and data readiness; and helping customers find information about our city more effectively.… The two most important things I want to know are how to develop AI policy and how is AI changing SEO." A year ago, most CEOs had a wait-and-see attitude about AI, following how the technology evolved and what their cohorts in other organizations were doing. Today, there is a general consensus among CEOs that they need to invest in AI, but the question is how and where. One CEO told me he knows he needs to integrate AI tools and processes into his DMO, but he has three overarching questions that he wants answered first, at least at a high level: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” Other CEOs are seeking clarity on the basic fundamentals of AI: "I need to understand what are the problems that we're trying to solve with AI. What is the purpose of a chatbot, for example? What am I buying, and what can we as an organization accomplish with it?" And then others just want immediate actionable solutions: "I'm not interested in hypotheticals. Show me five ways I can implement AI on Monday. Give me turnkey AI solutions that work today." AI Data is King Personalized data is one of generative AI’s biggest value propositions. Conversational AI (chat) is the new marketplace, and it’s eating the entire funnel including in-destination engagement. In some cities, AI chat conversations between DMOs and visitors is exceeding 25% in-destination, giving DMOs a way to influence visitor behavior in real time. Also, in some industry segments like tours and activities, in-chat conversations are driving in-destination bookings with partners like GetYourGuide. Everyone is looking for first/zero-party data around that. “We have a low level of proprietary data about who is in our destination and what they’re doing,” asserted one CEO. “We have a few disparate data sources, but we need to connect those, and we want to be able to use it predictively. For example, we're looking at regression analysis to help develop future scenario modeling, and we're looking at AI to help us with that." Another CEO said, “We need data that provides material value for our partners. That’s our mandate. How are our visitors spending money and where? How are they behaving and traveling through our area? How can we help people find our partners in a more personalized way?” And one CEO added, "A key priority for us is figuring out the data equation so outbound messaging can be tailored to a 1-on-1 relationship.” Striving for that direct individual customer engagement has been the holy grail for marketers for decades. The ability to deliver mass personalization at scale is now coming into focus with enhanced AI data curation. National organizations like Destination Canada and Germany Travel have invested millions of dollars in data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to restructure their tourism product data from scratch, capitalize on the data more effectively to rank higher in AI search, and drive incremental revenue to partners. That's what the future looks like. For more information, check out the new Canadian Tourism Data Collective and Germany's Open Data Project . Today, local tourism organizations are starting to see how data structure and content architecture are strategic imperatives for them, too. One municipal CEO explained, "I think it might almost be too early to have this conversation in some areas until AI matures more. One thing I am eager to know now is how do we develop a data lake to structure our own data and messaging to make it easier for AI search tools to find." AI search and SEO are a huge conversation today. During the past year, the #1 question I heard while speaking about AI with dozens of North American destination organizations, their boards and key industry/community stakeholders, was: How do we rank higher in AI search? What happens when AI buries organic content? What’s going to happen to our websites? Are they going to disappear? Is a DMO without a website still a DMO? How do we need to produce content differently? And, what the heck is a data lake? One CEO I spoke with is planning on developing a new website for her organization. She said, "I don't even know what I don't know about AI search, but we need to figure some of that out before we start spending any money." Along with data, defining KPIs for AI integration is a hot topic of debate, and presently there isn’t a complete and codified list of metrics that DMO leaders agree on. That said, perhaps the travel and tourism industry collectively needs to understand what AI is, and what it can accomplish at scale, before attaching too many metrics to it. A CMO told me at DI MarCom Summit this month, “People didn’t ask about ROI with the internet when it first came around. We just knew we had to have it,” because it was a new channel for reaching visitors. Same as AI now. Expanding on that, he suggested that DMOs need to break AI success tracking into awareness metrics and performance metrics, and get that conversation right before anything else. Staff AI Adoption Unlike previous technology evolutions, there doesn’t seem to be as much of a generational divide between early adopters of AI and everyone else. The industry can’t look to Gen Z for guidance about how to use AI to the same degree we once asked Millennials for insights about Instagram. Again, driving AI adoption across an organization begins with the CEO. Once that’s established, the real challenge is convincing department leaders and staff to lean into AI. It's a challenge because there is widespread concern, skepticism and/or suspicion among many staff members across many industries that they’re being asked to learn new technologies that will eventually replace them. Leadership should say to employees that no one can force them to use AI, but the job market will. The data is clear. According to the Linkedin/Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index : 79% of leaders agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with Al skills than a more experienced one without 66% of leaders won’t hire someone without AI skills 60% of leaders worry their organization lacks a plan and vision to implement AI And that's a year old. But, understandably, emphasizing those numbers comes across as threatening. A better strategy for driving AI adoption is finding staff members who are already seeing success with AI, supporting them with access to education and pro AI models, and working out from there. The more employees see their colleagues using AI, the more some of them feel inclined to lean in. Therefore, every DMO needs a comprehensive strategic AI road map that includes purpose, policy, education, integration and a continuous feedback loop across all levels of staff. CEOs need to create a space for that. "We're giving our staff time to play around with AI, but they have to present what they're focusing on and what they're learning to their individual supervisor," a CEO told me. Another added, “We're focusing on staff adoption. But I need you to explain to me what works, how to implement, and what should I watch out for." I'm presently working with our departments at Matador Network to explore a bunch of various AI models to optimize workflows, boost creativity, enhance strategic planning, diversify product, etc. There's a well-communicated mandate from the top that Matador will become an AI-first company, and sooner than later. To help accelerate that, we created an AI task force to bring more perspectives from across the company together to integrate AI into operations. That has been valuable with some immediate takeaways, such as staff is now reaching out and asking for assistance with AI. But it's only a start. "There's this idea that if you can get a core group of people using AI then their attitudes and behaviors will spread organically throughout the rest of the company," said Conor Grennan at NYU. "It doesn't work that way. You have to find the people who have fears about AI and listen to them to understand why. You have to say, 'Yes, AI does suck at that, but here's what it's good at.' You also need to weed out the negative people who are against AI outright. They're dangerous." 5 Key Takeaways Let's go back to that first CEO who wants to know the five big questions about AI. Based on the input from the above CEOs, here's a first stab at that: How can I create AI policy that serves our organization but doesn't suppress experimentation among staff? (Interestingly, policy did not come up that much with the CEOs I spoke with.) How do we need to develop our websites, content and data to rank higher in AI search? How is AI SEO different, and the same, as old SEO? What are existing AI chat platforms accomplishing, how are visitors using them, and how are they influencing travel decision making and purchase behavior? If AI is not just for marketing, what does the ecosystem of AI tools for all departments look like across the organization? And what do they do in terms of increasing productivity, creativity and quality? How do I get staff to buy in? We know AI is an imperative for our organization's competitive advantage and relevance. And we know AI is an imperative for employees for their professional growth and marketability. But how do we get our people to really believe in the need to embrace AI? Greg Oates

Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Royce Chwin, president and CEO of Destination Vancouver , personifies how a DMO chief executive needs to establish and articulate the mandate for integrating AI across the organization. That was the topic of our last Destination AI post where 12 CEOs explained: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . Early in 2024, Chwin addressed the full staff in Destination Vancouver’s office before a session I was presenting there on AI. “We cannot not do this,” he said, stating that the organization needed to adopt AI processes to stay relevant in the industry and increase its value in the community. If Destination Vancouver is positioning itself as an innovative DMO, he explained, then the road ahead with AI was clear. Since then, Destination Vancouver launched a new website fully integrated with AI where visitors can customize how they find travel information. The build was a two-year process requiring an inordinate amount of learning to capitalize on generative AI. The team also developed an AI policy guide that Chwin shared for this post. The comprehensive document is designed to "provide clear protocols that maximize and encourage the use of Al tools where appropriate and safe to do so, while minimizing any potential risks and concerns." The policy guide encourages staff to use AI for "enhancing productivity, efficiency, creativity or decision-making." It defines when not to use AI models and how staff is required to review and validate all AI outputs for accuracy and bias. Also, Stefan Hawes, vp of global marketing, initiated the development of an internal AI Council, bringing together a diverse group of staff to coordinate AI processes across the organization. Chwin shared an internal briefing report outlining the purpose of the Council as follows: It is recommended that an AI Council be established immediately to provide a centralized body for managing AI-related initiatives and to expand training opportunities for team members. The Council will focus on: Setting strategic priorities related to AI Selecting use cases, implementing projects/initiatives/AI software purchases and evaluating their effectiveness Developing a data strategy to support AI adoption and initiatives Developing an AI education, literacy and adoption program Ensuring ethical compliance Fostering cross-departmental collaboration to maximize the impact of AI projects We created a similar AI task force at Matador, and the value of that cannot be overstated to better assess how staff from different departments perceive, and misperceive, AI in general. I talked with Chwin this week to better understand how a DMO CEO can best lead strategic AI implementation across his or her organization. The purpose of this post is to help inform, inspire and influence other CEOs to consider the opportunities of AI in a new light. Greg Oates: Royce, you've been a strident proponent of AI for a couple years now, and yet there are many other CEOs who are still reticent. How did you personally come to decide Destination Vancouver needed to embrace AI? Royce Chwin: The perception still of some DMOs is that we are behind when it comes to technology. We're slow to adapt. We're slow to evolve. You see all these other organizations in the travel sphere around us that are able to move much quicker. They might be capitalized better. They can adjust. They can pivot quicker to take on these new technologies, and they can experiment seemingly without the degree of fear or consternation that maybe some DMOs have. So, I think there's lots of different reasons. For us, I mean, it's day and night. We can't not do that. Our entire ecosystem that we play in has some level of AI being used. Number one is our customers. They’re using AI. So it goes back to that same idea that you and I have discussed many times before: How do we as a DMO stay relevant and how do we show value? AI is a response to answering those two things. GO: In many organizations today, there’s often skepticism and suspicion among staff about how AI might take their jobs, or they’re dismissive of AI altogether. How does your team feel about AI overall? RC: I'm not finding a fear in our organization for using AI. I think it's a different set of challenges. I think there are so many derivatives of AI out there that people don't know what to focus on. Because you can’t and don't need to focus on 40 different AI tools. The question is, what are the best tools that are most relevant to the work that I need to do? That, I think, in my experience is a bigger challenge. My sense of it is that AI can be so overwhelming. It can seem unbelievably complicated. So we had to ask ourselves, do we have the time, resources and skill sets to simply understand it? Secondly, are we asking better questions to understand what in the organization we need to solve, and can AI help? GO: In a previous post, I shared input from 12 DMO CEOs about how they feel about AI. What are you hearing from other CEOs? RC: I was over in Europe recently for Destinations International’s Global Leaders Forum where I was onstage with Sherrif Karamat (CEO of PCMA) and Petra Stušek (CEO at Ljubljana Tourism). We were talking about the importance of face-to-face meetings and so on, and Sherrif made a comment that DMOs are really behind using AI. It was kind of a blanket statement, and he's not wrong. But, I said to Sheriff that I think a lot of DMOs are behind because it's like throwing confetti in somebody's face and asking them to pick the best pieces. They don't even know what they're trying to evaluate, and it’s also moving so fast. In the meantime, our customers are running around us using AI for all kinds of things. And so I think that there's not so much a fear of using AI. It’s more that people are questioning how to respond to the increasing emergence of AI because they’re thinking, “I'm not really 100% clear on the business problem I'm trying to solve that supports my mandate.” For us, and you saw it when you visited, we were really clear on what it is that we needed to do. We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI. “We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI.” GO: I’ve been asserting that CEOs should own and lead AI adoption in their organizations to have the best chance for success. I don't mean lead it day to day. I mean the chief executive must establish the mandate that AI is something the organization is going to invest in, and articulate why and how to the entire staff. Connor Grennan, chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, emphasized to me that’s the only way this works. Do you agree? RC: Yes, I absolutely believe it must come from the CEO because the CEO has to clear the vision with the team. And with something as seismic as AI, and how it’s evolving in our daily life, in our world, I think the CEO has a responsibility to address it and how it will impact the organization. Everyone needs to understand how we’re going to use AI in alignment with our mission and strategic goals, and how it will support the mandate. That's all CEO level. That's the responsibility on my head. Also, I can't imagine going in front of my Board and asking, “Hey, what are you doing with AI? What should we do with AI?” So it has to come from the CEO, but my Board has also enabled me. Like, there's no grief from my Board. Zero. We are fully enabled. GO: You've created the necessary structure to help govern AI integration with your AI Policy and AI Council. Can you expand on the thinking behind those? RC: We developed an AI policy that’s designed to enable people to use AI and not discourage them from experimenting. Obviously, some education is required in terms of proprietary information and those kinds of things. But we're really leaning into this and we're going to assign some time for it to enable the organization to experiment and play with AI without fear of reprisal. Naturally there needs to be governance around it, but governance does not mean stopping creativity. Governance means we’re creating and delivering new opportunities for creativity. There just needs to be structure around that. Also, Stefan came up with the idea of pulling together an AI Council in the organization, which I think is fantastic. We're getting individuals from each business line, including myself, and we’re going to talk about AI, its impacts, what we need to be thinking about, and how we'll improve our website and the organization as a whole. So we're creating dialogue around it to define opportunities. For example, I'm really excited about AI as it relates to all the country market analysis that we do. We've been doing that by spreadsheet, but now we’re exploring AI to provide the insights we need to inform our market planning more effectively. There are lots of different examples like that, but you only discover them by being open to experimenting with AI. Greg Oates

Toronto & Denver Tourism Leaders on the 5 Big AI Questions for CEOs Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates A year from now, the travel and tourism sector might look back and thank Andrew Weir, president and CEO of Destination Toronto , for catalyzing how DMOs move forward with AI. At PCMA Convening Leaders in January this year, I asked Weir what CEOs need to understand about AI at a high level. Numerous other CEOs have told me there’s a complete lack of AI education specifically designed for DMO chief executives. His answer was first shared anonymously in our previous post, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” said Weir. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" At the end of that post I suggested what those five questions might be based on all the CEO insights in there, and I've since been shopping them around to vet them. A few weeks ago, for example, Richard Scharf, president and CEO at Visit Denver , suggested restructuring the questions to create a more logical hierarchy. Now, the first three deal with internal operations while the last two identify external, visitor-facing priorities. Yesterday, I spoke again with Weir, as well as Paula Port, vice president of marketing at Destination Toronto, for their input on the five questions. The goal here is to provide clear structure around AI platforms and processes for DMOs leading up to Matador Network’s collaboration with U.S. Travel at ESTO in Phoenix this fall. Together, we’ll be co-hosting an interactive, multi-station “AI Playground” educational activation during the three days of the conference. Here are the five big AI questions. These will evolve but now we have a foundation to begin building consensus on how DMOs can capitalize on opportunities and navigate challenges with AI today. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The 5 Big AI Questions 1. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? A growing number of DMO leaders say their teams embrace AI for the most part, and many are actively developing basic AI strategy. That’s a significant shift from a year ago. At the same time, there's still varying degrees of cynicism and skepticism about AI in other organizations. I asked Weir about his staff. “I don't feel like we're dragging the team into this,” he said. “It's really more a matter of how people are at such different places with AI. So our goal is figuring out how to channel all their knowledge and energy, and kind of align and unify that, without stifling anyone’s creativity.” Scharf at Visit Denver emphasized that this question should be the first one, because successful AI integration begins with understanding your staff’s grasp of AI and their appetite for leaning into it. “ChatGPT is growing like Zoom did a few years ago so we know we need to use it,” he said. “The first thing we did was survey staff to assess how they feel about AI, and how or if they’re using it. Then we started off with small bites like email. Now we think of AI as a toolkit, and we're continuing to explore what tools are appropriate for different needs.” Port added that AI integration across teams works best with both structured and self-directed learning. “We started by making everything (ChatGPT Plus, Google Gemini) available to everyone, so they were given access to tools and resources, but a lot of this is really self-directed learning,” she said. “What we're seeing now is people have taken advantage of that and moved forward with it. Some maybe a little bit further than others, so maybe we need to address that. I think we still need more use cases and more structured learning because we're not all at the same level in terms of knowing and understanding how to put AI to use.” 2. How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? Destination Toronto was one of the first North American municipal DMOs to develop an AI policy. They began the process by pulling examples from larger government-operated tourism organizations including Destination Canada and Destination British Columbia. “We set up that policy structure first in terms of what we wanted as an organization, and also being very clear that any use of AI was meant to drive business results,” said Weir. “I think we were able to get there pretty quickly because we didn't create a series of regulations. We built a series of philosophies and principles to guide where we go. It was meant to put guardrails around protecting information, while at the same time, stimulate learning and sharing. Because we said to the team that you are free and encouraged to use AI, but there is an expectation that you will share what you've learned.” Port explained further that, “We leveraged existing processes already in place from a content perspective in terms of bias, IT usage, etc. We have an assessment process for any sort of software application that we're looking to use, so we did the same with AI.” (Note: The next GuideGeek Destination AI post will be with Kara Franker, president and CEO of Visit Florida Keys, who is also an attorney. We discussed AI policy at length.) 3. How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? Scharf stated that integrating AI platforms and processes beyond marketing is “where all the work is happening now.” His organization is switching out regular stand up meetings with extended AI workshops and visiting speakers to learn more about AI tools for various use cases across departments. Leadership, he said, including himself, are present at these meetings so everyone is learning together. Weir and Port both addressed this question, saying they need to first explore how Simpleview, Cvent and other tech partners are integrating AI functionality before looking at any new AI platforms. We discussed PCMA’s Project Spark , an AI-native event development tool that includes the new Destinaitor destination sourcing platform. DMO leadership and sales teams are exploring Spark to understand how clients are using new AI software to evaluate, compare and source destinations for business events. Others, like Kara Franker mentioned above, are looking for new AI solutions to optimize their HR and accounting departments, but she said many of the available options presently are only enterprise grade. Something DMOs should really look at, and I’m not sure how/if many already are, but there is proven value in creating custom GPTs for sales teams. GPTs are like mini ChatGPTs designed for specific purposes that anyone with a ChatGPT Plus account can create. For example, a sales rep can build a knowledge base inside a GPT by uploading sales materials, examples of successful bids, product information, pricing, team members, case studies, testimonials and other data. The next step is to develop internal GPT instructions to direct what the GPT does and what it prioritizes. Following that, the rep can then chat with the GPT and ask it to create a customized bid for a potential client that pulls all relevant source materials from the knowledge base that best supports the pitch. I’m imagining the ability to create custom GPTs is going to soon be a standard and required capability for all sales teams. One of the earliest enterprise examples of this was Salesforce’s Einstein GPT, which has since morphed into Agentforce. We use them at Matador because of improved efficiency and quality. GPTs also provide a new option for creative brainstorming, which some salespeople appreciate who don't identify as being super creative. Increases in sales production can be clearly identified. However, there's increasing conversation about tracking success in other departments. When AI delivers clear improvements in efficiency and saves people significant time, how do you measure that? One concern is that people will then just work a six hour day versus eight hours. The common thinking is that organizations will need to adjust productivity benchmarks, but this is a messy conversation. I don’t know enough to comment on that yet, but I wanted to put a pin in it because it’s something we’ll all need to look at eventually as AI scales in the workforce. 4. How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? I was addressing Visit Denver’s Board a while back and one member suggested that DMOs won’t need websites soon because they’ll be replaced by a ChatGPT-like window. I’m surprised by how much this comes up. For one thing, DMOs will always need some kind of online knowledge base for AI search queries. If anything, that will require more content and more comprehensive product information because AI search thrives more than anything on data structure, clarity and specificity. That said, the web user interface will likely evolve considerably. Expect to hear a lot more about how DMOs are developing data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to optimize data structure for AI search. For further context, here's a Perplexity Pro response to the question: "Are tourism boards developing data lakes and warehouses to optimize their sites for AI search?" Weir suggested that this conversation about the future of websites is not unlike what we went through 15 years ago, when people were lamenting the death of DMO sites because social media was deemed by some as the new web. More important, he asserted, is seeing how AI search is evolving and being prepared to adapt strategy. “I think there is a push-pull here between how we lead and where customers are at,” said Weir. “We want to deliver more information through our AI assistant and AI search in general, but customers aren't really there yet. I don't know what the percentage is, but the majority of people are still using Google. They're still beginning an interaction on the web by entering search terms in Google the traditional way. At some point, that's going to flip, right? It's going to be a few percent more each month or quarter, whatever that is. But how far ahead of it do we get? And how do we calibrate? We can try to lead on this, but you know, we also have to stay in step with where our customers are too.” 5. How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? Chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI have dashboards that clearly identify what visitors are asking about in the destination. That helps inform content and product development strategy, and the data is valuable for community engagement. AI chat platforms also operate 24/7 in 50+ languages, which helps DMO influence in-destination travel and spending for a much wider audience than ever before. How to best capitalize on conversational AI, and ultimately conversational commerce, is an evolving topic because we’re still in the early days where travelers are learning they can search with large language models and trust them. ChatGPT has 400 million weekly users but ChatGPT only added full functioning search capability for all users a few months ago. Consumers are just beginning to understand that they can now “talk” to a city. To help accelerate understanding and adoption of AI chat among visitors, Port asserted that the onus is on DMOs to promote their AI chat robustly like any other channel. Weir did that recently by highlighting Destination Toronto’s GuideGeek-powered “6ix” chat platform on LinkedIn, asking, “Ever had a chat directly with a city?” Weir was specifically promoting the organization’s WhatsApp platform, where people can now have a highly personalized, iterative conversation directly with Destination Toronto via the GuideGeek AI integration. The same functionality exists with the other Meta platforms, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. A few hours after Weir's post I received a Slack message from our CTO Stefan Klopp wondering what was going on in Toronto. WhatsApp volume was spiking, he said, and he was asking if Toronto had sent out a press release promoting 6ix, or something. No, it was just a quick CEO social media post. Also, Tourism New Zealand just launched a new campaign in collaboration with “A Minecraft Movie” that integrates GuideGeek-powered prompt questions to trigger further engagement. So, those are just a couple examples of how DMO/NTOs can drive AI chat engagement. The question for Weir and Port though is about the types of questions people are asking in AI chat platforms. Presently, a lot of the chat conversations are more utilitarian, related to queries about hotels, restaurants, attractions, events, directions, etc. So as conversational AI adoption increases, will DMOs focus more on developing content that answers those basic types of questions, like what hotel, restaurant or attraction is highly rated, and how to get there. Or, should DMOs continue to focus mainly on developing what is generally perceived as more inspirational destination and experiential content? "The question then becomes about responding to inquiries versus the inspirational side," explained Port. "Like, all of these articles, all of this content that we serve up, that is not in response to a question per se. It's more packaged to inspire people. I think a lot of that's going to have to exist outside our environments, maybe, whether it's influencers, it's your earned media strategy, it's content partnerships, things like that. That's where I think the inspiration will exist. But we really have to move to being more of the informative one, on our website or whatever a website is. But it needs to be very specific in answering questions. We already see that on GuideGeek." Weir summed up, saying, "I think this ends up relating more to, again, that question of where the customers are. Are we putting ourselves in a position to answer their questions and deliver the information in the way they're looking for it, using AI and the data lake approach? Or, are we curators like we've always been, inspiring visitors with local experiences, or is the customer now the curator by virtue of how they're asking questions today?" Summary These five takeaways are aligned with the five big AI questions. AI adoption begins with talking to DMO staff to understand what the organization is working with. Love the idea about marrying structured and self-directed learning, and being intentional about that with staff. At some point, for AI adoption to scale and continually evolve on an ongoing basis, there needs to be AI leaders in any organization who pick up the torch and inspire their colleagues to lean into AI. Otherwise, things tend to plateau with the same people using the same AI models. AI policy is intended to encourage staff to innovate with AI as much as it's meant to protect organizations. AI is the death of "I don't know," so it can benefit all staff in all departments. That in itself is enough ROI to validate initial investments in AI. The tools can provide a foundation of knowledge and direction for problem solving and strategic planning exponentially better than traditional search. Some organizations, like Visit Greece who we work with, have phenomenal website data structure ideally optimized for AI search. Meanwhile, one CEO told me "Our website is a mess with outdated content and poor data structure. We need to rebuild from scratch with AI search top of mind." Chat is the new marketplace, and AI is eating the entire funnel including in-destination. Moreover, AI chat data provides DMO leaders with insights into what visitors are asking about. Although, I think as chat adoption scales mainstream, the conversations will evolve beyond asking for a good hotel or restaurant. Greg Oates

Why Small Steps With AI Create Big Wins for Tourism Organizations Sep 22 Written By Greg Oates Key Theme: How to Align Strategic Risk Management and Progressive AI Implementation The rush to transform everything with AI has dominated boardroom discussions since ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Yet the most successful organizations aren't pursuing wholesale AI overhauls. They're taking calculated, incremental steps that deliver real value while building capabilities for the future. MIT researchers interviewed senior managers at 21 large companies actively using generative AI. Their findings challenge the prevailing narrative about AI transformation. Companies are deliberately choosing "small t" transformations over risky, large-scale implementations. This approach works particularly well for tourism organizations where customer trust and regulatory compliance matter deeply. Tourism organizations face unique challenges with AI adoption. Customer data privacy concerns run high. Regulatory requirements vary across jurisdictions. Service quality directly impacts reputation. The research reveals that successful companies treat AI implementation like climbing a risk slope. They start with low-risk internal applications before moving to customer-facing solutions. This measured approach isn't about being timid. It's about being smart. Tourism CEOs can build organizational confidence, develop necessary skills, and demonstrate tangible value before tackling more complex implementations. Start With Universal Productivity Tools That Employees Already Want to Use The research uncovered a surprising reality. Employees were already using ChatGPT and other public AI tools without permission. Companies responded by providing secure, private versions of these tools. This grassroots adoption pattern offers tourism organizations a clear starting point. Consider how your marketing team writes destination descriptions. Your operations staff creates training materials. Your finance team prepares reports. These tasks consume hours of employee time across every department. Private AI instances from providers like ChatGPT or Claude eliminate security concerns while boosting productivity. McKinsey built a custom platform called Lilli that connects AI to 40 internal knowledge sources. The result? Seventy-five percent employee adoption in under a year. Time savings up to 30%. Substantially improved work quality. Tourism organizations don't need to build something this sophisticated initially. Even basic AI writing assistants can transform daily work. Microsoft Copilot integration takes this further. Employees can search across company documents instantly. They can pull content from emails, meeting transcripts, and presentations. One manager described it as having "a super search engine" for company information. Imagine your team finding that obscure policy document from three years ago in seconds rather than hours. The beauty of starting here? Minimal risk. Maximum adoption. Employees want these tools. They're probably already using consumer versions. Providing enterprise versions addresses security concerns while meeting existing demand. Your IT team maintains control. Your employees get productivity gains. Everyone wins. Some employees will still seek external tools for specific needs. One product manager uses Midjourney for quick visuals. Another uses voice-to-text tools for performance reviews. Accept this reality. Focus on providing core tools internally while establishing clear guidelines for external tool usage. Deploy AI for Specific Roles While Keeping Humans in Control Once basic AI tools gain traction, tourism organizations can target specific job functions. The key insight from the research? Maintain human oversight for quality control. This "human in the loop" approach reduces risk while capturing efficiency gains. Customer service represents an ideal starting point for tourism organizations. AI can help agents find information quickly. It can suggest responses in real time. It can analyze call patterns to identify coaching opportunities. MIT researchers found AI coaching tools increased call center productivity by 14% on average. New and low-skilled workers improved by 34%. Morgan Stanley equipped financial advisors with an AI assistant trained on over one million internal documents. The tool doesn't replace advisors. It helps them find information faster so they can focus on customer relationships. Tourism organizations can apply this same principle. Help your concierge staff access local recommendations instantly. Enable tour guides to answer obscure historical questions accurately. Support reservation agents with instant access to availability across properties. CarMax demonstrates another powerful application. The company uses AI to generate descriptions for over 5,000 car pages. Manual creation would take multiple humans 11 years. With AI, it takes hours. The 80% approval rate from editorial review proves quality doesn't suffer. Tourism organizations can apply this to property descriptions, tour summaries, and destination guides. Creative teams at Dentsu use AI throughout their workflow. From proposals to budgeting to ideation. The emerging technology director noted employees spend less time on mundane tasks. They create higher-quality content with less effort. Tourism marketing teams can similarly accelerate campaign development, social media content creation, and promotional material design. Finance departments traditionally resist new technology. Yet some organizations successfully use AI for audit reports, regulatory compliance, and fraud detection. Amazon's finance team reports employees shifted from repetitive tasks to critical thinking work. Tourism organizations can start with expense report processing or invoice matching before tackling complex financial analysis. Transform Customer Experiences Gradually With Clear Boundaries Customer-facing AI sits highest on the risk slope. Yet the potential rewards justify careful exploration. The research shows companies succeeding by setting clear boundaries and expanding gradually. Chatbots evolved from frustrating phone trees to sophisticated conversational agents. John Hancock's insurance chatbots handle common queries effectively. Human agents focus on complex issues. Starbucks, Domino's, and CVS expanded to voice interactions. Video interactions come next. Tourism organizations can start with FAQ chatbots on their websites. Add booking assistance once that works well. Expand to voice-based concierge services when ready. Personalization transforms online shopping experiences. Tapestry, parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, uses real-time language modifications. The conversational tone mimics in-store associates. Revenue increased at least 3%. Tourism organizations can personalize trip recommendations based on past bookings. Adjust website content for different traveler segments. Customize email campaigns for individual preferences. Software companies already embed AI throughout their products. Adobe users create and modify images effortlessly. Canva simplifies presentation creation. Lucidchart converts text descriptions into flowcharts. Tourism organizations benefit as their existing software vendors add AI features. Property management systems will suggest optimal pricing. Booking platforms will predict cancellation risks. Marketing tools will automate campaign optimization. The key? Start small. Test thoroughly. Expand gradually. A failed internal productivity tool frustrates employees. A failed customer-facing AI damages your brand. Move up the risk slope deliberately. Build Foundational Capabilities Before Attempting Major Transformations The research revealed an uncomfortable truth. Scaling AI from pilot to production is harder than expected. Data quality issues multiply. Edge cases appear more frequently. Integration challenges compound. Many organizations discovered they needed stronger foundations before pursuing ambitious AI projects. CarMax's chief information officer emphasized data quality. "Good data will give you good results from AI." Poor data produces unreliable outputs. Tourism organizations must audit their data systems. Customer records across multiple systems need reconciliation. Historical booking data requires cleaning. Property information needs standardization. Governance structures matter equally. Who approves AI projects? How do you measure success? What happens when AI makes mistakes? Establish these frameworks before scaling implementations. Small pilots can proceed without perfect governance. Enterprise deployments cannot. Capital One's chief scientist warned against the "gold-rush mentality." Thoughtful, responsible implementation beats rushed deployment. Build the scaffolding to bring everyone along. Tourism organizations should resist pressure to match competitors' AI announcements. Focus on sustainable progress over headlines. Management buy-in proves essential for larger projects. One technology company's AI efforts stagnated until the CEO personally championed them. Small wins build credibility for bigger investments. Document productivity gains from initial deployments. Share customer satisfaction improvements. Make the business case concrete before requesting major funding. Summary: Small Transformations Today Enable Big Transformations Tomorrow The research delivers a clear message for tourism CEOs. Successful AI implementation doesn't require revolutionary change. It requires evolutionary progress. Start with universal productivity tools that employees already want. Target specific roles with human oversight. Transform customer experiences within careful boundaries. Build foundational capabilities systematically. This approach particularly suits tourism organizations. Your business depends on human connections. Technology should enhance these connections, not replace them. Your customers value authentic experiences. AI should enable better experiences, not artificial ones. Your reputation takes years to build and moments to destroy. Measured AI deployment protects what you've built while enabling future growth. The companies studied aren't waiting for perfect AI solutions. They're using today's technology to solve real problems while preparing for tomorrow's possibilities. They're training employees, cleaning data, and establishing governance. When breakthrough AI capabilities arrive, they'll be ready to capitalize quickly. Tourism organizations can follow this same path. Deploy AI writing assistants next month. Add customer service chatbots next quarter. Enhance personalization next year. Each step builds on the last. Each success enables the next. Small transformations compound into competitive advantage. The AI transformation race isn't won by the fastest starter. It's won by consistent, strategic progress. Tourism CEOs who embrace "small t" transformation today position their organizations for "big T" transformation tomorrow. The journey starts with a single step up the risk slope. Greg Oates

How to Develop AI Strategy for Your Organization Oct 12 Written By Greg Oates The 2050 City AI Roadmap provides a high-level strategic framework for how DMOs and other organizations can capitalize on AI to optimize internal operations, resources and knowledge, and ultimately, drive partner revenue. DMOs have all kinds of strategic plans, master plans, business and marketing plans, etc. The 2050 City AI Roadmap outlines the process to develop your AI strategic plan. It defines the big picture outlook for AI as the future of commerce, and it proposes a methodology to help DMO leaders prioritize, organize and navigate how they go about integrating AI across their organization. Presently, we're rolling this out with Visit Mesa , Tourism Richmond in British Columbia, and The Florida Keys & Key West . The three CEOs for those organizations have all agreed to share takeaways and business outcomes with each others' teams to cross-pollinate learning and accelerate AI process integration. That spirit of knowledge sharing and co-learning for me is huge, because we as an industry are all pretty much flying blindly with AI from a macro perspective. Yes, we've come a long way in the last year. Every DMO CEO I talk to these days is now implementing various AI processes and seeing value. However, we're all kind of flying this plane while we're building it at the same time, and we don't really have a destination, or even due north, in mind. The 2050 City AI Roadmap was designed to identify where we're going with this emergent technology that's both incredibly powerful and often highly unpredictable. It also defines how high-end AI chat platforms, like Matador Network's GuideGeek AI , are the tip of the spear for agentic commerce. The following guidelines are based on experience in the workplace to deliver new value with AI for your team, board, industry partners and community stakeholders. Internal & External Direction Every decision related to AI strategy should first be defined through an internal or external lens. Your board members will typically view internal workplace optimization as tactical. Externally, AI integrations that are consumer-facing and revenue generating are usually perceived as more strategic. Internal Facing From an internal standpoint, the focus of the AI Roadmap is on optimizing operations to take advantage of an organization's aggregate of resources and knowledge. Imagine the totality of insights across every team member in terms of their expertise and networks in their communities. AI systems are designed to pool and capitalize on that, but only if an organization's knowledge base is structured intelligently. That means rebuilding your folder structures and files naming conventions so an AI can find everything. According to Slack, workers spend 41% of their time on menial tasks, including endless hours just looking for information. The overall losses related to productivity, quality of work and workplace, and physical/mental health are crazy. So let's start there with AI strategy to address our internal digital dumpster fire. External Facing Externally, from a marketing, sales and visitor/partner engagement perspective, AI strategy begins with integrating a robust AI chat platform like GuideGeek. DMOs have never really had proprietary information on who their visitors are. They have geo-location, credit card spend, event attendance data, etc., which show visitor behavior. But none of those really identify visitor motivations and mindsets indepth. With an AI chat platform, DMOs can now pull analytics showing what visitors are actually asking and what they want to know on an individual and aggregate basis. We launched our new GuideGeek V2 analytics dashboard this past week, which provides deeper, fuller insights into visitor psychographics. That data then informs all kinds of resource allocation decisions related to content development, AI SEO strategy, data analysis, product and destination development, community engagement, etc. CEO Roles AI is best defined as a new digital "co-intelligence" that can communicate, reason and create for the first time ever, versus just another new technology. We emphasize that AI is really a new environment for collaboration more than anything, just not solely among humans anymore. Learning AI is not like learning Photoshop. You can only "teach" AI up to a point, like trying to teach someone how to ride a bike. You can't teach a child how to stay on two wheels without falling in a classroom. He or she actually has to start pedaling, and eventually the child's mind and body basically have a conversation, so to speak, with the bike to grasp the fundamentals of moving forward successfully. Same with AI. The only way to learn AI is to use AI. Helping human teams embrace this new co-intelligence (and it's not like there's a choice) falls under the umbrella of change management. That's a CEO's wheelhouse. It will take more than a few years for many humans to reconcile their minds and values with this new relationship, and it falls on the CEO's shoulders to steward that reconciliation. Likewise, CEOs oversee AI governance, policy and privacy. I've shared before how AI governance should be viewed less like a car brake and more like a steering wheel to inform, direct and accelerate AI adoption and integration. Lastly, only CEOs can scale long-term AI benefits and business outcomes effectively. You can't really delegate this. AI efforts will plateau at times, some or many AI experimentations will fail, and there are always staff members who will drag their feet because they just don't like AI. DMO CEOs are chief people officers and it's on them to create the right culture for scaling AI platforms and processes effectively for everyone in their crews. Agentic AI This is where things get interesting. AI agents and agentic commerce might sound super confusing for many or most staff members. Lots of land mines to watch out for, sure, but even more reasons for us building a macro DMO AI strategic framework. One of the key objectives for the AI Roadmap is to elevate AI agents and agentic commerce as the two interrelated cornerstones for AI strategy, and explain why. Doing so shows the true big picture value of AI, and it drives home how we eventually need to move way beyond training people the basics of prompting. Yes, it's intimidating, but we introduce the labels and contexts relating to agentic AI early on in the process. That gets some people thinking bigger about AI, and it entices the AI champions in the group to start experimenting with agents. AI Agents (Internal) For internal AI strategy, leading DMOs are developing AI agents and automated workflows to address the aforementioned 41% of time that staff members spend on grunt work and trying to find information. They are proven, they work, and most of all, they deliver measurable ROI. We're working with outside contractors at Matador to develop and implement agents and automations for both ourselves internally and for DMO clients. We are already seeing success, and there's been a recent influx among our people asking for agents. It's an amazing thing to see when staff members start requesting new AI integrations like that, proactively. That's when you know your AI strategy is working at least on some level. Agentic Commerce (External) AI agents are also the foundation for agentic commerce. According to Mastercard , "Agentic commerce is a new form of online and mobile shopping, in which an AI agent 'closes the loop' or completes tasks for a user — such as searching for items, comparing options and making a purchase — with limited or no manual inputs needed from that user. For example, while chatting in a generative AI app, you could tell the AI agent, 'Book me a nonstop flight to London for under $600 next week — no red-eyes,' and the agent will review airlines, nearby airports and your loyalty memberships and payment card rewards to identify the best option, purchase it and then share it with you." Just like with AI agents, developing agentic commerce architecture covers a wide spectrum of sophistication and capabilities. Going back to the analogy of flying a plane while building it with no clear final destination in mind, agentic commerce is the point on the map where we want to land. With GuideGeek, we have Kayak, GetYourGuide, Skyscanner and other booking tools integrated into the platform with a click-through UX/UI. Looking ahead, we're working with one national tourism organization to bring some of their national partners' booking engines (air, hotel, tour op, etc.,) into the platform to eventually convert sales in-chat. Subscribe to Mastercard Signals to keep up-to-date on agentic commerce and access intelligence like this Mastercard Payments Trends Navigator report. Staff Training & AI Integration Training staff and implementing AI processes across all departments is really the meat of the 2050 City Roadmap. But none of that should proceed without DMO leadership embracing all the above, and communicating it clearly to all staff. Easier said than done, though. Leadership needs to continually communicate a high-level approach to AI strategy, because it won't really click for many staff (or leadership) at the beginning of this process. That, of course, needs to be married with all the practical training initiatives we're continuing to develop. We've already learned a ton with the present work we're doing training DMO teams. Here are a few very basic takeaways just to start explaining our process. There are obviously many more educational modules following these, ranging from predictive analytics to specific department AI training in areas like HR, finance and legal. Conduct an internal AI survey asking all staff to share their perceptions and usage of AI. Follow that up with small group interviews across the organization, and transcribe everything with an AI notetaker. We use Granola, but there are many others. Also, explain to staff that all meetings regarding AI will be recorded to create an internal knowledge base to identify opportunities, challenges and takeaways over time. Start training with a focus on just the paid/pro models of ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. Some staff feel confused with the sheer variety of available AI tools in front of them. We explain that, at the end of the day, the basics of using AI include an end user, an AI tool, and a knowledge base. Get people on board with that, and then show how most of the AI tools they have access to are similar in many ways. One of the fastest methods to advance AI understanding is showing staff how to create custom GPTs in ChatGPT. Some team members will pick up on these quickly and start integrating them into their workflows right away. These are the people who typically make up your internal AI taskforce. Explain and show how Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot are AI workhorses that connect with the majority of people's daily workflows. However, humans tend to think of those as just the next evolution of search engines. This is mental wiring that needs to be broken. Gemini and Copilot are great/good in some ways, but I've found that training staff on just those three native LLMs first (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) is more effective for seeing the light. Google NotebookLM has a lot of fans. I like to walk teams through it because it's a good way to reinforce what a knowledge base is, like we do with the custom GPTs. Also, the automated audio and video podcasts are crowd pleasers, especially with the new Join function where users can engage directly with the agentic podcast hosts. People don't seem to want to read anymore. This was a rude awakening for us when we first launched the AI Roadmap with a series of online training materials. We now know we need to deliver short video instruction if we want anyone to actually look at the educational content. People love Descript for AI-powered video creation. Once we started showing how to use Descript, we were pleasantly surprised to see how staff really leaned in. Teaching Descript provides a fun break early in the process because people can see pretty amazing results in minutes and wrap their minds around the process fairly easily. Ask all staff to share how they're using AI effectively and where they see AI failing them. Catalogue the case studies and share across the organization to accelerate learning, inspire a healthy sense of internal competition, and track learning over time. Staff members are also often wowed seeing AI agents in action. We use n8n to develop agents, where you can create a lot of basic automated workflows quickly. Once a few early adopters see how agents can take over some of their more tedious, time-consuming tasks, others will jump in. Feedback Loop & Funding/Board Support This line in the AI Roadmap is broken down into tactical internal optimization and more strategic, consumer-facing and revenue-generating sales, marketing and stakeholder engagement. I don't have a lot to share for this section and the following one because our focus to date has been mostly on the above phases. Feedback Loop The reason we record every engagement with AI Roadmap clients is to scale learning, so if one person learns something, everyone can benefit. That will be further multiplied when we starting sharing takeaways across DMOS, and eventually the industry as a whole. Visit Mesa, Tourism Richmond and Visit Florida Keys are eager to lead this initiative, and we plan to launch a new AI thought leadership framework collectively in 2026. Funding & Board Support The spark that led to developing the AI Roadmap happened almost a year ago when a board member for a large DMO told me that she viewed AI integration as merely a tactic. If this work can elevate AI in the minds of board members toward a more high-level strategic imperative, then we'll have achieved part of our mission. There's still some work to be done first though to collect more case studies showing direct AI business outcomes before we can make a more solid case for additional funding for AI integrations. AI Strategic Plan We've produced a mockup of what we think an AI Strategic Plan will eventually look like, but it's too early to show presently. For now, we've identified three overarching pillars, each with potential strategies, action items, timelines and targets. The KPIs are crucial, of course, for scaling AI strategy across the travel industry. Right now, we're thinking the three pillars might look like the following, although this is all up in the air right now: Optimize Internal Operations & Knowledge: The strategies include cleaning up internal folders/files to improve AI outcomes in general and develop AI agents specifically. A lot in here on training, experimentation, overall adoption, success measures, etc. Increase Partner Revenue with Agentic AI: Defining how DMOs develop AI agents to fuel agentic commerce is the big goal overall with the AI Roadmap. Initial strategies in this pillar begin with more low hanging fruit though, such as website redevelopment, optimizing for AI SEO, AI chat integration, etc. Expand Community Collaboration: We're seeing more DMOs take a leading role in AI education for their industry and community stakeholders. The 2050 City Roadmap is perfectly suited for informing how DMO leaders can facilitate community AI workshops and increase the organization's overall relevance and value. Greg Oates

Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Kara Franker , president and CEO of The Florida Keys & Key West tourism organization, was among the first DMO leaders to embrace AI platforms and processes in 2023 when she was chief executive at Visit Estes Park in Colorado. In May 2024, Franker published two papers on AI strategy and policy: From the Base of the Rocky Mountains to the World: A case study through Visit Estes Park’s journey into Generative AI solutions — and how your DMO can carve its own AI path Navigating AI and the Law in the Travel Industry: An Introduction to Legal Implications for DMOs The first paper highlights how Visit Estes Park integrated GuideGeek AI chat into their website and three Meta platforms: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The DMO also branded the chat Rocky Mountain Roamer to give it an identity and bit of personality. The second paper focused on AI policy and data privacy, security and compliance. Franker, who is an attorney, co-wrote that with Roxanne Steinhoff , also an attorney at Steinhoff Law, who leads the firm’s destination marketing and sports tourism practice. I caught up with Franker to see how her perspectives on AI strategy and policy are evolving almost a year later. Greg Oates: You've been leading AI strategy in tourism for almost two years beginning with your work at Visit Estes Park. However, there’s still a lack of AI training today specific for DMO CEOs, and many leaders are presently unsure how to proceed with AI. As a CEO, what’s your take on that? Kara Franker: I'm not surprised that there's a lack of training because there's just so much for everybody to wrap their heads around. I think some people are trying to watch and wait and see. My philosophy has been more of a fall-forward, fail-forward kind of approach. That's why I put the white papers out. Anybody could learn from what we had done, and do it better. You know, a case study is sometimes the best way to figure this stuff out, so that's why we did it. The second paper on AI policy was with Roxanne Steinhoff on the legal and ethical implications of AI. Because when I would go and speak in front of groups, those were always the big questions from the leadership. They don't know how far is too far once you open this can of worms. That's why we got together and started to put guardrails in place that we thought might make sense for people to study, just as a first stab at it. That all launched last summer, so I do think that there's a little bit of education out there but we could definitely use more. GO: What do DMOs need to know about AI policy at a very high level in terms of privacy and security? KF: Employee and client information should be kept private and not uploaded into any AI tools. That could be a big deal, thinking of all the different rules and regulations about collecting information, especially how it's more stringent in Europe than in the United States. That can cause potential problems if you're uploading, say, a client list that has personal cell phones, email addresses or other information that people just don't want out there. So, it's really more about information that's attached to a person. And then, is there competitive data that you don't necessarily want others to have? Possibly, but so much of what we do in the DMO space is public anyways so the lines for that are pretty blurry. I’m trying to imagine a scenario where a DMO is, like, basically hacking somebody else's information through AI. I can’t imagine that’s worth the time and effort, or even possible. GO: A few months ago we were discussing what AI tools might be available for DMO departments like HR and accounting to help with privacy, compliance, efficiency, etc. But everything available seems to be enterprise grade and out of reach for DMOs. So what’s the answer for scaling AI across an organization? KF: I think this is a huge need. I hired somebody from Cisco who’s my new VP of technology and partnerships. She's a total AI nerd like I am, and way more qualified to dive into all this. She and I have been looking at different options to put together, almost like little plugins. We really, really need this. For example, how do we take an AI solution from the legal world to analyze all our contracts so that we don't have to spend as many hours with attorneys, because we really just need a template, right? And then for HR, same thing. How do we organize all our employee files into a much more streamlined and effective system? And then there’s our policies. We're a nonprofit but everything we do is so heavily influenced by County government. We have so many compliance issues, so I want an AI to learn every single piece of County policies so we’re able to compare and contrast what we're doing with those policies. I haven't been able to find anything to help with these things. We've looked at a lot of different options but it's like what you're saying. They're these big enterprise pieces built for law firms or financial people, and they’re all really expensive. None of them fit the mold for improving different operations at a DMO. In my mind, the marketing side is covered, especially with GuideGeek, and there are so many great options now for everything involved with marketing. So I feel like that's been tackled and done really well. But for the operations, we need more. I mean, we’ve just got to keep digging deeper, I think. GO: When you and your technology person from Cisco figure all this out, will you share what you find with the rest of us? KF: Of course, always. GO: Backing up a bit, you were arguably the very first DMO CEO to lean into AI, at least in North America, when you were with Visit Estes Park. How did you convince your board that investing in AI was important at the time, and what were some of your processes with bringing along staff? KF: We were fortunate in the sense that the board was all in and the staff were all in. And I don't mean to make age a part of it, but the staff was a little on the young side and they were all very ambitious. Everybody wanted to try to figure it out. So we made the argument to the board, if we could figure out some of what AI could do, it would make the community stronger and they could take pieces of it back to their businesses. There wasn't really anybody who was against experimenting and trying it out. We made some mistakes along the way and we put that in the white paper. Also, when we first rolled out GuideGeek, which scrapes the website, we found a few holes in our content. There were particular board members who didn't have very robust information about their business, so they got a little bit mad, but not in a, like, burn it down way. It was more of, "Oh, okay, we have some work to do." So part of the AI process has to actually be community outreach. It can't just be about the technology. We have to talk to all our partners and get really robust information from them, so when the AI crawls the site it gets the best possible information about our partners. GO: One thing you did at Visit Estes Park was brand your GuideGeek AI as Rocky Mountain Roamer on your website and three Meta platforms. We use that as a case study a lot, and emphasize that a DMO should promote their AI just like any other channel, right? KF: Definitely. We knew we had to put money behind marketing the tool if we wanted people to interact with it. Traditionally with a DMO, one of your calls to action is to send people to the website. Our new call to action for a lot of our campaigns back then was to send people to the AI, so we called it Rocky Mountain Roamer to help promote and drive traffic to it. And then in terms of KPIs, we wanted to track all the interactions you can see in the backend, but not just how many people used it. We wanted to know how long people interacted with the AI, what their journey was, and what they were asking about because that’s where things get really interesting. GO: After the initial thrill of launching GuideGeek, how did you manage how staff used AI internally? Were there any incentives involved to help spur adoption and experimentation? KF: The incentive for my team was, well, it wasn't really an incentive. It was a requirement. They had to write weekly reports for me about how they tested something with AI, whatever it was. It could apply to their job or not, I didn't really care. So I almost forced them to try AI. But then people started really getting into it. They were getting more and more user friendly with different AI tools, and they would be like, “Oh, I like Anthropic because of this or that,” because they were branching out from just using ChatGPT. So, yeah, there has to be almost like a culture of AI in your DMO for it to really work, and it's on the CEO to create and foster that. Greg Oates

Join Matador Network's AI Playground at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Matador Network, GuideGeek AI and U.S. Travel are launching the inaugural "AI Playground" at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix, August 17-19. The educational space, hands-on demo area, genius bar and live sessions will run all three days during the conference. We are also producing programming specific for travel industry CEOs, along with other sessions dedicated for senior executives, highlighting actionable AI strategies focusing on real world business outcomes. Leading up to ESTO, I'll be reaching out to many of you requesting any AI-related success stories and/or questions you might have for the AI Playground. Looking back over the last two years, it's clear the industry is turning a corner in 2025 when it comes to AI learning and adoption. Many DMOs and their industry partners are now integrating AI processes and platforms across their organizations, whereas last year many destination leaders were still in wait-and-see mode. For those of you still on the fringes, it is our ambition that the AI Playground will plant a flag in the ground showing how AI is now a proven strategy for helping DMOs further deliver on their mandate. "AI is clearly powering the future of travel and how people explore the world today," says Ross Borden, founder and CEO of Matador Network. "We are stoked to be working with U.S. Travel and investing in our industry to produce the AI Playground. AI will become standard operating procedure for every DMO soon, and we're excited to help lead this journey." DMO CEOs on AI Strategy Matador launched its proprietary GuideGeek AI chat platform for DMO websites and social media channels almost two years ago. We now have more than 40 DMOs onboard, and we're expanding the scope of GuideGeek AI with new hotel groups and tour operators joing in recent months. Based on our experience working with municipal, regional and national organizations across the global visitor industry, we have unparalleled insights into how conversational AI is changing the relationship between destinations and visitors, as well as how DMOs operate internally. In preparation for ESTO 2025, we launched this GuideGeek Destination AI newsletter in January to ramp up our industry outreach and further expand our understanding of how DMO leaders are navigating the rise of AI. Here are five stories from the newsletter that inform high-level decision making related to AI strategy, with input from more than 15 CEO DMOs: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI : Our first post with 12 DMO CEOs highlighted the wide range of questions they have. One asked for the five big AI questions he should know about. Another wants practical advice on five AI initiatives that he can implement, like, tomorrow. Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism : CEO Royce Chwin, who helms Destination Vancouver, shared why his organization was one of the first DMOs in the world to dive into AI. Destination Toronto & Visit Denver CEOs on the 5 Big AI Questions in Tourism : Two chief executives, Andrew Weir in Toronto and Richard Scharf in Denver, worked out what they believe are the five big AI themes/questions that DMOs need to focus on, as touched on in the first post. Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation : Newly installed Florida Keys CEO Kara Franker, who is also an attorney, shed light on AI policy, compliance and the need for more non-enterprise AI solutions for her organization. Visit Mesa CEO Launches New DMO AI Road Map : Another visionary DMO chief executive, Visit Mesa leader Marc Garcia is bringing a new level of structure and direction for integrating AI processes and platforms. Next up, Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau, will be discussing AI strategy from a business events perspective. I also met with Cody Chomiak, vice president of marketing at Travel Manitoba, who's really lighting a fire in Canada around AI thought leadership and adoption. He'll be sharing a few powerful AI case studies from his provincial marketing organization, both internal and visitor-facing. AI Playground at ESTO 2025 The AI Playground this year will feature three stations at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge . We will have our Matador GuideGeek team and U.S. Travel staff on hand to guide participants through the space, along with some invited AI experts from around the industry. We'll be digging into a handful of paid AI models including ChatGPT Plus/Teams, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro, Google AI Pro, Microsoft Copilot Pro and Manus. We'll show how AI is best navigated at DMOs by bucketing strategy into three unique categories: Search, Create and Sales. Specific use cases will include content generation and data analysis, AI SEO and AI-optimized web development, AI policy and governance, staff adoption, building custom GPTs for sales proposals, and automated workflows and AI agents, among others. The three stations are: The Prompt Lab welcomes all attendees to come in and test drive various AI models. The interactive, hands-on learning station will have multiple laptops for experimenting with AI tools for people of all skill levels. We'll have a bunch of paid AI models pre-loaded for live demos and one-on-one conversations showing how AI actually works and some of what it accomplishes across different departments. Feel free to bring your own laptop if you like. The Genius Bar is designed for individual and group Q&A about real world AI strategy, implementation and ROI. We'll be collecting all the questions posed to share with the broader industry afterward, so we'll have a couple crowdsourcing boards to help generate new ideas and explore new solutions. Reach out to me if you want to schedule time to talk during ESTO. The AI Theater seating area will host a range of AI-focused dialogues, micro-presentations and a few dedicated sessions designed for CEOs, as well as other senior executives. The programming schedule for all those will engagements be included in the ESTO agenda. Most importantly, all the conversations at the AI Playground will highlight tangible AI case studies and specific business outcomes. The 5 Big Questions About AI One of the best things to come out of all the interviews with DMO CEOs this year is our list of the five big AI questions that chief executives need to focus on. These questions will likely evolve a bit, but for now they're providing direction for how we're developing the AI Playground and how DMOs are moving forward with AI integration. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work?

Visit Mesa CEO Launches New AI Roadmap Aug 25 Written By Greg Oates Visit Mesa in Arizona kicked off a new internal initiative this week to integrate AI processes and platforms across the organization. I worked with Visit Mesa to help develop their new DMO AI Roadmap, which provides a 5-phase strategic framework that most any visitor organization can use as a template. The project officially began this week during Visit Mesa’s spring board meeting to communicate why the organization is moving forward with AI to optimize the DMO’s value for Mesa’s visitor industry and the local community. Marc Garcia, CATP , president and CEO of Visit Mesa, has been eager to start this initiative. He was one of the dozen CEOs who contributed to the first GuideGeek Destination AI story a few months back, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI. For that deep dive into a CEO's mindset regarding AI, Garcia asked: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” The Visit Mesa DMO AI Roadmap answers those questions. “I've recognized that AI is extremely important not only for the world moving forward, but specifically for our industry,” Garcia explained at the beginning of this project. “We at Visit Mesa need to get out in front of it. Even as a small to medium-sized DMO with our budget, we've always taken pride in the fact that we’re typically at the forefront of the latest and greatest in terms of technology, and so this is just an extension of that.” The following is a high-level overview of the DMO AI Roadmap and each of the five phases. However, like all strategic planning, there is a big jump between developing a plan and executing it effectively. This is especially true with internal AI training. In any given organization today, there is often a wide breadth of how people perceive AI and how proficient they are with AI models. It will take time to educate and align everyone around shared benefits for the organizations and staff, expected processes, intended outcomes and success metrics. Visit Mesa AI Roadmap The DMO AI Roadmap is a structured, phased approach for educating staff and integrating AI across DMO departments. The goals for the roadmap are to optimize internal operations, enhance sales and marketing outcomes, inspire staff self-learning, future-proof the organization, and contribute to how well local industry and community leaders adopt AI best practices and benefit from them. There are two imperatives that should be established and agreed upon among leadership at the very beginning. Integrating AI processes and platforms is an imperative for the DMO to ensure its relevancy and long-term impact in the local visitor economy. If leadership doesn’t fully believe that, this strategic framework won’t work. AI proficiency is an imperative for staff members for their future growth and marketability. That said, you can’t really force people to embrace, learn and use AI intentionally, but the job market will. The following phases are highly fluid and some of the processes can be rolled out concurrently. Ultimately, these phases provide structure for effectively and responsibly implementing a new technology that has no precedent. Because of generative AI, machines can now do three things they haven’t been able to do before. They have the ability to reason, the ability to communicate, and the ability to generate stuff based on that reasoning and communication. Meaning, AI is messy. Integrating it into our daily workflows is also messy because it's challenging us to rethink our relationship with technology. But as Kate Yordi, director of marketing at Visit Mesa, said during the board meeting this week, “Finally, we have some direction.” Phase 1: Leadership Alignment & Staff Communication As discussed at length in previous Destination AI posts, the DMO CEO must make it clear to all staff that the organization prioritizes AI because the organization prioritizes being relevant. It certainly helps, as is the case with Visit Mesa, when the CEO is fully backed by the board to invest in AI integration. During the board meeting, one member asked, “What do you need from us, Marc?” That’s a good sign. For the DMO AI Roadmap to work, all leadership needs to not only have a basic understanding of AI tools, they need to actually use them as well on a regular basis. That goes a long way in driving agency across the organization. However, making that happen typically requires some C-suite training to explain the primary AI models more indepth: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot and/or Google Gemini depending on the specific workplace platform(s) the organization uses. Identifying and prioritizing just a handful of AI models like that brings a lot of clarity to the process right off the bat. You see people's shoulders relax when they're confronted with 5-6 AIs versus dozens. (Yes, VEED, Gamma, Manus, Sora, Granola, Slack AI, etc., are all really cool but let's not start there.) A common lament among DMO leadership related to AI is, “Where do we even start?” Leadership should then discuss and begin to answer the five big questions all CEOs face when navigating AI integration, as vetted in the aforementioned Destination AI post about what CEOs want regarding AI education: How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI (who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI) to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and quality of work? How do we redevelop our content and channels to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI for business purposes to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The next step in this phase, at a basic level, is communicating to staff why they’re being asked to embrace AI. The following is not meant to be comprehensive, but a CEO would likely want to articulate: The purpose of the AI Roadmap, guiding principles, and the phases and processes involved How AI integration will take time and people will evolve at different paces It’s ok if everyone feels like they’re building the plane while flying it Everyone is encouraged to use AI and will be supported, but there will also be guardrails in place AI adoption and use cases will become part of employee reviews, but traditional roles, responsibilities and key success metrics are still the priority "How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents." — Marc Garcia, president and CEO, Visit Mesa Phase 2: Staff Assessment & AI Task Force Sitting down and asking staff how they feel about AI and how/if they’re using it is a good way to begin. Depending on the size of the organization, this can be done with every staff member individually or a representative group from each department. Generally people fall into three camps when it comes to AI: 1) Those who are already using AI on a regular basis; 2) those who are curious and have experimented a bit, but they don’t actively engage with AI tools; and 3) those who don’t see much value in AI. This last group can also include people who outright oppose AI, but they make themselves apparent pretty quickly. Data also shows there is often a significant percentage of staff who use AI in secret because they’re not sure they’re allowed to use it for work purposes. The second way to collect staff sentiment and AI capacity is with a blind online survey asking everyone what they like about AI, what concerns them, how they feel about job security, what they want to learn, what they hope to achieve, etc. Everything is anonymous so you can expect a wide variety of feedback ranging from constructive/optimistic to fears of an impending robot apocalypse. Once complete, all the data should be synthesized into key takeaways for leadership and shared with staff to show a high level of transparency right from the beginning of this process. The second part of this phase is developing an AI task force. The value of this cannot be overemphasized. Choose a small group of AI champions from various departments to do three things: Provide direction for stewarding the various processes in each phase as effectively as possible from beginning to end Share constructive and thoughtful input they’re hearing from other staff members about how things are proceeding well and where there are challenges Help scale AI adoption across teams by showing how they’re using AI effectively to everyone else in the organization An internal AI task force or council is invaluable because the members are motivated and they want to learn. Mostly, their enthusiasm and success with AI will begin to rub off on many of their colleagues and inspire self-learning and greater adoption among the teams. But not all. There will be those who disengage, and there can be a significant number of them. Over time, they should be consulted to understand their trepidation, which should then be addressed. This is a challenge I'm having with one organization where a significant cohort are saying they're too busy to learn AI. Meanwhile, the majority of the staff are reporting daily usage with effective results, which definitely wasn't the case a few months ago. And even with those leaning in, the level of improvement and AI Iearning will be slow at times. This is why it’s critical for the CEO and the rest of management to be all-in and consistently participate in staff training sessions to show direction, intention and support. It’s very easy for the novelty of AI training to wear off after the first few months. This is where the AI task force can be instrumental to help maintain overall staff interest and keep engagement levels as high as possible. "Finally, we have some direction." — Kate Yordi, director of marketing, Visit Mesa Phase 3: AI Policy & Investments Developing an official AI policy and governance manual accomplishes two primary objectives: It protects the organization against legal and financial liability by establishing how all employees are required to use AI responsibly. It encourages and gives license for staff to proactively experiment with AI because there are clear guidelines in place about how to do so. There are many DMOs who have created AI policies and are willing to share with the rest of the industry. These are typically not lengthy documents (3-4 pages) nor full of legalese. Generally they’re written so every single employee can understand everything in them. Sections in these policies often include: Positioning/Purpose Statement: Expresses how and why the organization needs to be intentional about implementing AI processes Primary Objectives and Intended Outcomes: Defines the business case for how the organization is attempting to deliver on its core mandate of driving revenue to local businesses in alignment with community priorities Guiding Principles: Establishes the principles of responsible AI use in alignment with the values of the organizations related to themes such as inclusivity, bias, authenticity, veracity, collaboration, knowledge sharing, etc. AI Definitions: Provides clear explanations of AI terminology used in the document and workplace AI Tools: Identifies specific AI models that the organization provides access to Data Input: Dictates clear rules about what employees can upload into AI models and what they can’t upload, such as personal information of any person Monitoring: Defines how the organization reserves the right to monitor AI practices Training & Support: Defines opportunities for professional growth and learning AI on an ongoing basis There are other items that DMOs might include in the above list, and they vary depending on how HR, financial and legal departments interpret AI governance, but it serves as a foundation. One key consideration for DMO leadership when it comes to policy is identifying which pro AI models to invest in. Paid AI tools provide higher levels of privacy and security because AI companies don’t train on them, or at least there’s the choice to select that option. Many DMOs, for example, purchase annual subscriptions for paid ChatGPT Team accounts ($25 per employee monthly) for staff to use for work, which is a first step for protecting the IP and other interests of the organization. Other paid AI models are then provided to specific departments based on need and the specific attributes of the tools, such as Claude for marketing and social media staff because many consider it the best AI for content creation. Phase 4: AI Education & Implementation This is the most important thing in training teams to embrace and use AI effectively. You want to foster an environment where structured learning evolves into self-learning. That’s the only way this scales. When staff members with little experience in AI start exploring how to use AI on their own, and they start helping their colleagues see new ways to use AI, that’s a pretty special thing. From an education standpoint, the DMO AI Roadmap begins at a high level defining AI’s place in online history. AI is the third transformational shift since the PC was invented, including: The mainstream web/internet in the 1990s; the evolution of mobile/social/cloud and apps in the 2000s; and gen AI in the 2020s. These are the only three times when big tech went all-in and pivoted their business models around a new technology. I then break AI training into the following buckets, and again, this is all very surface level and not meant to be comprehensive. Also, creating engaging demos are everything, and that's not also easy because AI demos can be a real slog sometimes. But, showing how different AIs provide real value is key for people to internalize their learning and use it more intuitively over time: Explain how pre-gen AI tech is deterministic and gen AI is probabilistic, which messes with a lot of people’s minds. Gen AI outputs are based on statistical patterns and probabilities, just like the human brain processes ideas and information. Traditional tech is based on absolutes, delivering the same output based on the same input. Old tech is about information. AI is about knowledge. Spend a lot of time on this with workshops and demos. Highlight the capabilities of only three AI models to start: ChatGPT for brainstorming and planning; Claude for writing and data analysis; and Perplexity for conversational search. The other two, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, are more general purpose. They also do amazing things (Gemini 2.5 Pro is great for reasoning), but focusing on the first three will provide direction at the beginning so people don’t get overwhelmed. At the very minimum, leadership should have a basic understanding of those three. Explain how AI search isn't 100% perfect but it's a 1,000% better than old search. Define how DMOs and all brnads are redesigning their websites and content strategy to optimize for AI search, and the basics of AI SEO . I would argue the most important thing for using AI is really understanding how generative AI = conversational AI. It's a dialogue. It's called "chat" for a reason. This is where I’ve heard the most positive feedback from teams I’ve worked with. It happens when people move beyond the Google mindset—where search is one and done—and they see the real value of iterative conversations with AI models that evolve with each exchange in the discussion, just like a human conversation. This also removes some misperceptions about how to prompt. Yes, there are some basic rules about how to prompt well. But beyond that, it’s vastly more beneficial to explore AI conversations further with thoughtful follow-up prompts that flow logically and organically to achieve the best results. Explore how the real value of AI extends beyond just efficiency and productivity gains. That's a dangerous dialogue with staff who can construe that as leading to more work or being terminated over time. The bigger value and better narrative is how AI increases creativity and knowledge, and how those both influence overall quality of work, marketing effectiveness, sales productivity, staff culture and pride, job satisfaction and growth opportunities, etc. Really dig into the advanced features of the paid models: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro. Aside from the added security and privacy they provide, they offer functions not available in the free models and their outputs are significantly better. ChatGPT Projects and custom GPTs, Claude Projects and Perplexity Spaces are where the magic happens. Create an environment where staff members are eager to share their successes with AI with the rest of the organization. This feedback loop is critical for steering education and driving adoption, and it’s one of the most important roles for the internal AI task force. AI-training meetings can be highly effective during video calls but they often have the greatest impact during in-person workshops. Also, make sure to give staff a specific amount of hours during the week to develop their AI skills. Explore options for AI chat platforms and the benefits they provide for visitors and local industry partners. I work with Matador Network, which developed the industry leading GuideGeek AI chat platform. The feedback from 35+ DMO clients is impressive and irrefutable, but there is still much work to do educating visitors and industry about AI chat strategy and their benefits to continually increase adoption and business outcomes. The DMO AI Roadmap also provides guidance for developing various learning and engagement formats: Schedule weekly or bi-weekly meetings specifically, and only, for AI training with both internal and external people sharing insights Create a library of AI educational materials for staff to reference Start a weekly internal AI newsletter to share how teams are using AI Start a Slack or similar channel dedicated for AI education, AI news updates, knowledge sharing, etc Start a weekly and optional one-hour AMA meeting for everyone to ask everyone else questions (highly effective) Create a regular schedule for staff to report back to leadership or department heads about how they’re using AI and what they’re achieving with it Phase 5: Success Tracking I kick off every AI presentation identifying the three AI models mentioned above—ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity—followed by the assertion that, "AI is the death of 'I don't know.'" That is arguably the biggest ROI for integrating AI in a DMO or any other type of organization. There are few questions that are too complex or too intimidating for DMO staff to approach with confidence and conviction if they know how to use those three AI models effectively. I shared an example previously where I used Perplexity Pro to educate myself about how board governance is evolving . That for me was something I knew was out of my realm of expertise, but now I feel I can speak with some semblance of authority about that to any board because of AI. Before gen AI, I dismissed board governance as one of those things I'd just have to leave in the dark. That said, trying to explain how AI helps staff become more self-reliant, where they can always build a foundation of understanding for anything to empower themselves, only goes so far with a board. They're looking for more quantitative KPIs. Here are just some examples of that in a DMO context. In 2025, defining KPIs for AI integration is an evolving science, and we as an industry are still figuring a lot of this out. Therefore, this list is nowhere near comprehensive and it will evolve, but we have ample data today to validate the following: Using AI for search and content development saves significant time and increases opportunities for higher output and increased creativity for producing blog posts, social media, videos, marketing campaigns, etc. Developing custom GPTs (in ChatGPT Plus) for group sales is a proven strategy for creating better, more customized proposals in much less time. That gives sales staff more time for brainstorming and prospecting leading to higher production. That's a fact. In this case, group sales people are actually pumped to try a new technology. Using AI for regression analysis and scenario modeling increases the accuracy of how DMOs predict visitor volumes year-round, event attendance, economic impact, etc. One of the biggest conversations in DMOs today is how to develop content and websites to rank higher in AI search. Developing best practices in AI SEO leads to higher traffic. That is a core mandate for any DMO, and no DMO can afford to ignore that over time. AI chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI are driving real business. As described in PhocusWire in March, New York City Tourism + Conventions launched its GuideGeek-powered "Ellis" meeting-specific AI chat in January. ROI to date: 100% increase in traffic to the meeting planner website, 800+ AI-driven queries in the first month, 50% growth in newsletter sign-ups, and 10% increase in time spent on the site. Summary The AI train has left the station and it's gaining steam. The DMO AI Roadmap is the next logical step for helping DMO CEOs and their teams integrate AI processes and platforms. As Visit Mesa's Kate Yordi said, "Finally, we now have direction." That's a big deal for DMO staff to feel that way. Generative AI has been with us for more than two years now, but a structured and phased approach for integrating AI across DMO departments has been the missing piece. Visit Mesa's DMO AI Roadmap is going to evolve as the team works through the process, but at least now there's a vision and scope. Visit Mesa CEO Marc Garcia and the board are fully committed—a critical first step for embarking on this journey. Also, this strategic framework for how DMOs approach AI is going to underpin the interactive AI Playground activation at U.S. Travel's upcoming ESTO conference in Phoenix, August 17-19. U.S. Travel and GuideGeek are partnering to develop educational programming for the hands-on AI training experience and series of thought leadership. Greg Oates

How AI Improves DMO and Community Master Planning Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Many DMOs are developing 10-year destination master plans to optimize their visitor economy in alignment with local community priorities. I've participated in producing dozens of them from Miami to Mesa. They often take as long as a year to complete because there's so much focus on community engagement in various formats: interviews, focus groups, town halls, surveys, visioning sessions, etc. The tourism industry talks about the importance of community a LOT. However, when you're working with a DMO, you never really dig into what actually moves the needle across so many endless community demands, not on a tactical and hyperlocal level. You're not really held accountable for any measure of success when it comes to community-specific initiatives, ranging from improving City Hall permitting processes for small businesses to tracking the movement of unhoused. A master plan needs to address those and amplify those kinds of pressing needs for the destination overall. The expectation is not really to fix them. That’s not the role of a DMO. It's a whole different ballgame when you're developing a long-term strategic framework for a community organization like Near Southside, Inc . in Fort Worth. Success and being accountable for fixing things is expected. Located at the periphery of the downtown core, Near Southside is the most interesting community in North America right now. The ex-industrial district can be loosely compared to Austin 20 years ago with the same cultural DNA and similar community values, based on a fiercely protective love for local, creative and independently owned small businesses. That's under threat. In the last few years, as Near Southside evolved into the coolest 'hood east and west of the Pecos Line, real estate prices are rising commensurately. We all know how this story often ends with the encroachment of national brands sanitizing the soul of a place that made it attractive in the first place. Near Southside is intent on rewriting that story. AI Processes for Strategic Planning Here's where AI comes in. Because of the multitude of overlapping challenges and evolving dynamics in the community, our team needs to crunch and debate a ton of qualitative and quantitative data. Addressing gentrification touches on so many aspects of how communities operate. Therefore, we are over-indexing on community engagement to get as many perspectives as possible to identify how the community best evolves in the face of rapid change. The amount of inputs we're getting is substantive, and we want to inventory all of it as thoroughly as possible to build a super comprehensive knowledge base for the AI to cull through, connect dots and output insights. Every individual zoom call with stakeholders is recorded with Granola AI, which produces full transcripts but the summaries are too light. So we created custom GPTs with instructions for everything we want in the summaries, including comprehensive overviews, key takeaways with detailed context for each, the most insightful quotes related to those takeaways, and all action items that stakeholders recommended. With the GPT, we can fire full transcripts into the chat, press "enter" and receive highly valuable, high quality and uniform summaries almost immediately. We're doing the same with the focus groups but the custom GPTs require a different set of instructions. The two-hour transcripts capture the conversations with 10-20 stakeholders convened across specific industry and community segments. For those, the GPTs bucket corresponding high-level takeaways and tactical action items related to the same theme. That has immeasurable value because these conversations are all over the place. It's great working with locals who are so passionate about where they live and how, but that means you're getting feedback from a firehose and someone taking notes doesn’t capture all the nuance. Using custom GPTs to produce these summaries and populate takeaways is as good or better than any team could do manually. Everything is stored in Airtable. Forget Google or Microsoft cloud platforms. Airtable is an AI-powered, relational database/spreadsheet beast for organizing data and automating basic workflows. The tables combine all project information in one place, such as a running list of pending/completed interviews and focus groups and their AI-generated summaries. Airtable can then auto-generate a summary of the summary in the same table for clients to easily review everything being collected on a daily basis to whatever degree they prefer. Once you use Airtable, you'll never look at Google Drive the same way again. I've never had so many insights so well organized, so thorough and so easy to share with a team and client to help inform each project phase. The client loves the transparency, immediacy and structure, naturally, versus waiting for the next weekly update to read a few bullet points in a PowerPoint. Here's the thing. Because we've been so intentional about collecting such a high quality and comprehensive volume of feedback, we have a motherlode of a knowledge base for AI to work with. We can then enter all that in bulk into Google NotebookLM or ChatGPT/Claude Projects to pull out anything from high-level aggregate takeaways to anything super customized or tactical. For example, the client was interested in hearing specifically just what developers had to say about gentrification. I wanted highlights related to anything discussed regarding City Hall processes. It’s super easy to pull reports together for those and anything else. Ultimately, you can use AI to deliver an outline, a strategy map and a very rough draft of a destination master plan. All you need to do is combine all of the above together, plus PDFs of all relevant public and private planning documents, PDFs of all relevant case studies and best practices, and detailed instructions about the purpose, elements, structure, etc., of the plan. People will disagree, sure. I'm not dismissing the expertise of people who put these things together, because they bring deep context to every conversation and decision made during the development of a master plan. Everything happening now in Near Southside has happened somewhere else. When you can bring takeaways from those places to any present situation, it helps provide direction for everyone in the room. Again, I’m not saying that AI is replacing humans. People get all kinds of worked up over that, especially in travel and tourism. I am saying you can create a better, more strategic and more informed master plan in a much more streamlined fashion when you employ AI strategically to better prepare a community for the future. That's just a fact. I have four more community focus groups today in Near Southside. The expectation among everyone is that their contributions will make a demonstrable difference in their neighborhood. We can’t just speak to the challenges. We need to fix them and our processes with AI are giving everyone more confidence that we can deliver on that. Wondering how many DMOs are interested in employing similar AI-first strategies to get a better handle on how to help their communities. Greg Oates

How Visit Richmond is Using AI to Sell More Conventions Aug 2 Written By Greg Oates DMO CEOs want specific use cases for AI showing how they drive measurable business results. Here's a great example for capitalizing on AI to drive meetings and conventions volume from Lauran Peoples , director of sales marketing and business development at Visit Richmond in Virginia. Peoples works in the organization's 13-person sales team and reports to the VP of sales. Her role has three core functions: She is the main liaison between the destination sales and marketing departments; she develops and leads campaign strategy for the sales department; and she works with her colleagues to optimize strategic partnerships. Peoples' role is somewhat unique as a liaison between sales and marketing in that she lives on the sales side, versus marketing. She also stands out in our industry as an emerging voice in AI innovation. If you're going to U.S. Travel's ESTO conference this month in Phoenix, look for her and me working in the show's inaugural AI Playground educational activation. Greg Oates: Can you explain your role at Visit Richmond, specifically in terms of how you bridge the sales and marketing teams? Lauran Peoples: It's becoming more common in DMOs for sales teams to have a marketing liaison, but usually that person is based on the marketing team and is mostly assigned to sales to help with creative. The issue is when that marketing liaison is based on the marketing team, they don't have much exposure to the field and what's happening out of market with your salespeople. Our sales team has 45 trade shows this upcoming fiscal year, so they're traveling almost every week. With my situation in Richmond, they're getting real-time data and downloads about what's happening in each destination, so that gives them more authentic conversations to engage planners. Not having someone assigned to a team like that creates a huge disconnect and leaves opportunity on the table. GO: Tell us a little about your journey with AI. LP: I've been working in hospitality for 20 years. Last year, I heard some younger people on the team talking about ChatGPT. So I was like, okay, I don't know anything about that. I went to PCMA Convening Leaders in January and the opening session was all about AI. I remember sitting there feeling like a dinosaur. Feeling very behind. I realized this is a lot more serious and widespread than I thought, so I left and tasked myself with using ChatGPT once a day. Initially, I couldn't differentiate how it wasn't like Google. I was asking it how many tablespoons are in this or that, kind of thing. Since then, my understanding of AI has progressively increased around more complex and comprehensive capabilities. It has streamlined my productivity, but more importantly, AI has become a thought partner for me to bounce all these ideas and scenarios around that I didn't have before. I think that a lot of people are adopting AI and using it as a communications assistant, or a writing assistant. But the part for me that's really exciting and valuable with AI is analyzing and aggregating data and getting it to show you things that you need help with, like sales. GO: Can you share an example? LP: Sure. I took five datasets: five years of lost business, five years of definite business, and three marketing reports from different campaigns we were running with outside agencies like Sojourn and Digital Edge. Those campaigns give us demographic insights because we were targeting certain areas. I also grabbed our sales deployment sheet, which tells you who has what market. I uploaded all of those into ChatGPT and asked it to identify the top five locations for each of our managers based on their market segments. Some results weren't surprising, but there were a few that popped up like Orlando that we've never traditionally considered. When I asked ChatGPT why Orlando, it showed how the city has a large hobby market. It turns out there are a lot of hobby conventions that meet in Orlando. After I compiled the top five locations for each manager, I asked ChatGPT to give me the top five accounts in each of those locations. Then I asked for unique selling propositions for each of those accounts as to why Richmond would be a perfect fit. Finally, I asked it to rank those five destinations based on probability of success. GO: Have you seen any of this result in new business opportunities? LP: Yes. One location that showed up was Philadelphia. Richmond is four hours from Philadelphia, but like Orlando it hasn't typically been on our radar. However, based on the data from ChatGPT, Philly came up as a recommendation. So we sent one of our sales managers to Philadelphia, and she ended up hosting 18 planners, including some who drove from over an hour away to see her. She got such a great response that I had to jump in and go with her because she couldn't host 18 clients by herself. AI has now informed our sales strategy for Philly, and the region is now part of our dedicated sales strategy. We've allocated funds for that sales manager in Philly to join chapters of organizations like MPI and PCMA. So that's how we know there had to be some accuracy to our approach with AI. GO: How do the sales managers feel about you doing this AI analysis? LP: They appreciate it. It's a balance because most sales managers at DMOs aren't entry level; they've been in hospitality for a long time. This is a new process and a new tool for them. Some have destinations they like to go to over and over because they're successful there. But my role is to support business enablement and sales enablement to help them do what they do better and uncover new business. So how we're using AI provides them with additional actionable research. GO: I think one of the most underrated strategies for AI is developing custom GPTs in ChatGPT to help sales teams develop more customized and effective proposals more quickly. Are you building those at all? LP: Yes, definitely. About a month and a half ago, I programmed a GPT for the sales team called "Prospecting Partner." It's trained on our sales collateral and all our information, so it knows our convention packages and understands our jurisdiction and seven localities. The sales managers have been using it to prospect smarter. I included suggested prompts to go beyond just, "Give me a prospecting email." We can get really specific, like, "Help me re-engage an association planner who just lost grant funding." It also provides strategies specifically related to that, and then you can ask how to execute those strategies. So, for example, we know from reports that finance and insurance is an opportunity market for us. It's a small percentage of our current business but it has the highest average daily rate, which makes it very attractive to our hotel partners. So our salespeople are asking ChatGPT for ways we can develop business in the finance and insurance market, and really dig into that. Ultimately, AI is helping our sales team think bigger, smarter and more strategically. I've asked the sales team if they found this helpful, and, you know, salespeople are not an easy crowd. They said yes across the board. With the ChatGPT Enterprise version, I can't see their exact prompts due to privacy, but I can see the number of conversations they're having with the tool, so I know they're actively using it. GO: How are other people on your team using AI? LP: My two direct reports are our CRM database administrator and our sales coordinator. My sales coordinator does support work for the entire team, so she's using ChatGPT a lot for ideation, like when a sales manager needs an itinerary to entertain clients in Chicago. My CRM database administrator uses ChatGPT as a communication assistant because sometimes analytical personality types can benefit from exploring more communication nuances. She's also started incorporating it into data cleanup, using it to analyze reports and suggest what's missing or what would be beneficial. She uses it to help fill in gaps and identify what's not being asked or said. GO: What are some of your future plans with AI? LP: We're launching microsites for destination sales and sports, and I think it will set a model for the rest of the organization because we’re replacing our website from pre- to post-AI, like most DMO sites these days. We're currently writing copy for the microsites, and I've been getting into structured data and semantic clarity. You don't search ChatGPT or prompt ChatGPT with the same language you search Google, so content has to be written differently. Previously, you'd go to Google and say "restaurants near me." Now with ChatGPT, it's more of a conversation, so you'll say, "Hey, I'm in Scott's Addition historic district in Richmond with my kids, and we're looking for a vegan restaurant." That semantic clarity allows AI to respond with much more specific answers. I think we need to anticipate AI searches, as opposed to Google searches, in how we write content. Everyone is subconsciously expecting a personally curated experience today. When I go on Amazon, I'm expecting it to make connections that I like this, so I might also like this, without me having to tell it certain things. That's where we have to move towards, or we get eclipsed or become obsolete, especially if we're just thinking of ourselves as brokers for a destination. Greg Oates

Visit Phoenix CEO on Leading AI Strategy and Being Chill About It Jul 28 Written By Greg Oates I learned a lot about how DMO leaders can confidently integrate AI processes into their organizations after speaking with Ron Price, CDME, president and CEO of Visit Phoenix. Price is somewhat new to AI but his staff have been doing cool things with various LLMs for a while. He says his primary role with AI is providing the Visit Phoenix team with an enabling environment for success built on a culture of trust. Price accomplishes that by inspiring everyone to experiment with AI, be aware of the liabilities, share their wins, have fun with it, reach out to others for advice, and most of all, validate everything. Although, what stood out for me the most talking with Price is his calm and clear approach to AI, basically inferring (in my words, not his)... "We got this. We might do something amazing today with AI or we might not, but either way we're fully committed to seeing what it can do. We're also going to figure this AI thing out by collaborating with our many DMO industry friends. Because AI is going to change everything in a hurry, and we at Visit Phoenix are not going to be caught staring out at a Sonoran sunset while the world passes our city by." That's the vibe I got. That's leadership. That's what being a CEO means, at least for me. AI is confusing, sure, and CEOs have to worry about their boards and electeds. The thing is, we're more than two and a half years into generative AI now, and it's not going to wait for CEOs to decide if they can "trust AI" or not. I think we can all learn from Price a few things: We can de-escalate all the hubris and hand-wringing surrounding AI by being open to possibilities and having a clear set of principles, especially related to responsible AI use and verification. You can have fun with AI and focus on business outcomes at the same time. The DMO industry needs to collaborate and share best practices more intentionally to accelerate AI education, innovation and integration. We must encourage DMO staff to use AI today so they can steer the future of our industry tomorrow. Price likes talking about AI. I would encourage any DMO CEOs on the fence with AI to reach out to him. Greg Oates: Ron, how do you use AI? Ron Price: I use AI every single day, going back now about a month and a half. I'm just fascinated and interested in what it's able to do. I wouldn't say I'm an early adopter, of course, although there are some people who aren't even on it yet. Me personally, I use it for everything, like if I'm curious about something that's happening within the region. Or maybe I want to quickly compile a lot of data to help solve a problem or answer questions as I get ready for different meetings. More or less, my brain is always just firing, like, "What if we tried this or that?" And so, this year has been a cool realization about what AI can do, and seeing how it's pulling all the sources through to validate what it responds with. We have also integrated AI with Microsoft Copilot. We pay for everyone to have access to that, and then we also have a ChatGPT Team account for our staff. GO: Where else are you seeing value with AI at Visit Phoenix? RP: In our world, it's marketing, it's content. I love being surrounded by people who can write really well. It's an art to me, and I don't possess that art. It's like someone playing the piano. I'm in awe of that. So AI gives people the ability to write better, and it's okay to lean into it. Don't feel threatened by it. AI is able to give you that one golden nugget, or it suggests that one good idea that can really help someone when they're writing. Here's the fun part. Every day, we're learning something unique. We have the Cronkite School of Journalism in Phoenix, and some of the students are here. We kind of give them free rein, and we're also teaching them at the same time. The way that they use AI is amazing. It's fun to walk down the hall to see them because I'm always like, "How did you write that? How did you create that image? How did you pull that data and research together?" It's just a different generation. We're also seeing where our people are asking AI things like, "If I'm a salesperson, how do I influence a group to come here in the middle of the summer for a conference? Why is it fun to be here for a conference when it's 110 degrees out?" And what does AI have to say? Well, one thing that's great about, say, Grok, for example, it's pulling from all these little texts on Twitter, or X. They're from people saying, "Hey, I know it's summertime in Phoenix but look what I got to do." Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use. GO: Does your staff using AI increase your organization's impact in the community? RP: We not only focus on growing tourism in our community, but we're also joined at the hip with economic development. We look at our role as we're here to build a better community through tourism. And so, when you think about utilizing all the data out there, we always ask ourselves, "How could AI help us consolidate that data and crunch the numbers faster to give us a clearer picture of what we think we know?" For example, how much business that comes in through our leads touch our priority sectors? And of those sectors, which ones align extremely well with what we're doing here at Visit Phoenix? Is it semiconductors? Is it bio-med? Is it something that leans into the engineering side because of what ASU and the Department of Defense are doing? We've seen we can go back and look at the data and get a better picture of those things now. Also, as an example, we have a high propensity to book business around the semiconductor space. So we're utilizing these AI tools to quickly do research like, "Give me a list of the top semiconductor conferences that take place around the world." The responses are quicker and the results are better versus doing a traditional Google search. It's able to pull from a lot of different sources, so that's another way we're using AI. “Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use.” GO: How do you define the role of a CEO to guide a DMO forward with AI? RP: Setting up the rules of the game is important. There are areas of liability we have to be aware of about what you can and can't be pulling in. Those are the types of things we needed to figure out, you know, basically, "What is our rule book for using AI?" I like giving people the ability to use AI as they will. I think it works best whenever people know that it's a tool we want them to utilize. And if it can help us at the end of the day tell a better story, be smarter as we go after business, and be smarter with our analytics to help build our marketing strategy stronger, then use it. I try to build a team of leaders so they're CEOs of their own divisions, and I want them to be thought leaders in their areas. Also, I think AI enables us to get to answers quickly, but, and this is important, how do we validate those answers? We're really good at Visit Phoenix when it comes to validating answers, but we're usually doing it by going the long way and understanding how AI responded like it did. We're reading source by source by source, and then we kind of come to our own conclusion. It's like we're not just focused on the punch line of a joke. We can also tell you the structure of the joke. You always have to validate. We get excited about using AI because it just puts us in a new position. I think it's good to have a CEO that supports that, but that support comes from a trust within the organization. I trust that people are going to utilize AI to help make us better. GO: What keeps you up at night regarding AI? RP: My fear is how do we control and ensure that someone isn't producing something negative on our behalf, and then launching it to the world, and using this incredible tool to hurt us? Because there are people that are extremely gullible who believe whatever they're looking at. That's kind of where my brain goes sometimes. It's only because of what I've already seen these tools can do. I think across the DMO industry, we'll have some "ahas," especially when we get together in various forums to exchange ideas. We need to be talking with each other about, "Here are some things that work really well with AI, and here are the headwinds." And then, "These are the things you need to realize could happen with AI, and here are some ways you can mitigate those problems." The more we can learn from others about how they're using AI, the better. I think what you're putting together about AI strategy with all your insights is going to be extremely valuable. GO: Thank you. So, what are you thinking about next with AI? RP: As AI continues to grow, and we've talked about it here internally, what is the value of a website? In fact, we just started our next fiscal year, July 1. Website visits is no longer a key metric that we're going after. As a leader, I like knowing what's three steps ahead. We currently have these tools, but how are they going to change the way we make decisions going forward? At some point, a lot of what we're talking about now is going to be white noise. And what then? It doesn't mean our jobs of promoting a destination change. It means we're going to get so much better at telling our story through so many different avenues. I believe that our reach is actually going to broaden. We're still going to be responsible for promoting our destination and selling our destination, but how we tell the story and how we show the story is going to change as these tools evolve. Back in the day, a lot of us were reading about Moore's Law and how things just keep improving and getting cheaper, especially in technology. Now we're moving into a space where the rate of growth with AI is going to be something we've never seen before. Greg Oates

German Convention Bureau Leader on the Future of AI-Powered Meetings Jul 27 Written By Greg Oates After the global financial crisis ended in 2011, a few cities and nations around the world began promoting themselves to meeting and convention organizers based on their intellectual capital, versus venues and attractions. Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau (GCB), led this strategy in Europe at the time. Around the same year, I was visiting the House of Logistics & Mobility (HOLM) think tank in Frankfurt. The GCB suggested I visit there to better understand this new direction for attracting high-value business events in advanced industries. "The city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," Dr. Stefan Walter told me, who was a professor at HOLM at the time. "So, this [GCB] strategy is about finding the strengths of our strengths, our core competencies, and for Germany, that’s knowledge and infrastructure. It’s also about connecting ideas.” That has been my due north working in the travel industry ever since. This idea that meeting planners and attendees can tap into a deep knowledge base in a host destination, specific to their interests, for me, is intoxicating. The challenge is it takes a ton of work connecting local leaders in specific advanced industries, like aviation in Frankfurt or e-mobility in Stuttgart, with large global organizations in those same industries and convince them to bring their big annual event to Germany. It's also pretty high level. From an attendee standpoint, if I'm in Hamburg and want to learn about HafenCity, the largest urban makeover in Europe, it's not like I can easily access a bunch of people and organizations leading the future of urban development. Which, would be cool, right? AI is helping make that a reality. Germany's national Open Data/Knowledge Graph project is an ambitious AI-powered initiative to build a massive network of industry suppliers, academic organizations and business leaders across the country. Basically, by indexing the visitor industry and intellectual capital supply chain, Germany can connect the brightest minds in Germany with the rest of the world more seamlessly, effectively and equitably. An "interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," if you will. I spoke with Mr. Schultze to learn more about how AI is impacting the meetings and convention industry in Germany. Greg Oates: How is AI evolving across Germany's visitor industry? Specifically, how are your municipal CVBs and other partners thinking about and using AI right now? Matthias Schultze: Like much of the world, things really accelerated for us around two years ago with the rise of tools like ChatGPT. Suddenly, everyone, from corporates to associations, started thinking seriously about AI. We saw an opportunity and created an innovation platform called ebx.lab . It’s a peer-to-peer learning community for event planners, where we partner with scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute to explore how AI might reshape the business events space. From those early sessions, we have published a few white papers and identified a few core insights. AI clearly has potential to personalize experiences, optimize event planning processes, improve engagement and networking, and maybe most exciting, support predictive analytics. That last one, especially, being able to anticipate trends or behaviors based on data, is what feels most transformative to me personally. GO: How is the GCB embracing AI internally? MS: We developed our own internal AI strategy for the German Convention Bureau. We wanted to give both our team and our stakeholders a shared framework, something that outlined where we are today, where we want to go, and how we get there. It’s called "Driven by People, Powered by Data," and that title really reflects our belief that AI is a tool, not a solution in itself. People need to lead the process. The strategy helps us clarify not just what we can do with AI, but also what we can’t or shouldn’t do, at least not yet. It outlines our roadmap and aligns everyone across our organization and membership. GO: Is that strategy available publicly? MS: Yes, though only in German for now. But with the right AI tools, you can translate it quickly. The strategy touches on everything from marketing and communications to event planning, workflow automation, customer personalization, sustainability, and even ethics and compliance. The ethics component is particularly important. As exciting as AI is, we have to keep guardrails in place. Within our organization, we’re working hard to ensure that AI isn’t something siloed or limited to leadership. It needs to be embedded across every level. Everyone in the organization is expected to develop basic AI literacy. We’ve also worked on minimum viable products for things like dashboards and customer-facing chatbots. Some are already in use today. GO: You've always been a strong and vocal proponent for sustainability in business events. How is AI supporting you there? MS: I’m very proud of a project we developed with 29 other European countries: the Sustainability Hub for Events . It’s an AI-driven platform that brings together all kinds of sustainability related data—certifications, guidelines, best practices—and makes them accessible through an interactive AI agent. Planners can ask things like, “Can you help me build a sustainable menu?” or input event details to estimate their CO₂ footprint. It’s highly practical, and it’s making a real difference for event planners who need fast, reliable and actionable sustainability information. GO: We've talked about your Open Data and Knowledge Graph project in Germany numerous times in the past. Is that now live? MS: It’s technically live but still in progress, and probably always will be, in a sense. We’re continuously expanding it. The Open Data Germany project by the German National Tourist Board is live with its Knowledge Graph. The Open Data MICE project, which is implemented in close cooperation with the GNTB, is not yet live. One exciting element launching soon is an interactive map of research institutions in Germany. It will show where key research and innovation is taking place, including medical tech, renewable energy and so on, and link that data to infrastructure like hotels and conference venues. The idea is to visualize Germany as a knowledge landscape. If you’re planning an event and you want to anchor it around a theme like urban mobility, the map will show you which regions are most active in that field and match you with the relevant venues and experts. GO: One theme I keep obsessing about, and it's felt like a bit of a fantasy for more than a decade, is that the city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine. That idea is a direct quote from your House of Logistics and Mobility in Frankfurt, and it’s stuck with me ever since I heard it back in 2011. It's this idea of a city as a platform. Do you think we're getting closer to executing on this idea, where innovation at all levels is more accessible and shareable for more people? Ultimately what we're talking about here is the democratization of knowledge and excellence. MS: I love that idea. I really do. I think there are two layers to it. On one level, we have the smart city movement with systems that integrate transportation, energy, data and infrastructure to make better decisions. That’s already happening in many places across Europe. But on a deeper level, regarding your fantasy.... Let's say you could land in Munich, be interested in urban tech, and immediately connect with people, events and institutions aligned with that interest—that’s becoming possible too. The data already exists. It’s just scattered. But with open data standards, machine readability, and the right AI tools, we can start connecting those dots. Your fantasy city may not be so far off.

A CEO's Playbook for AI Integration Oct 10 Written By Greg Oates Your competitors are talking about AI. Your board is asking about AI. Your partners want to see your AI strategy. Many DMOs are debating the potential of AI, while an increasing number of others are already extracting real business and organizational value. The difference isn't budget or technical talent. It's knowing exactly where to look for opportunities and how to scale what works. 3 Non-Negotiables You Must Lead This, Not Delegate It: AI transformation dies in committee. The organizations seeing real results have CEOs who champion specific initiatives, remove bureaucratic friction, and signal that AI adoption is a strategic priority. This doesn't mean micromanaging prompts. It means creating air cover for teams to experiment and fail fast. Complex Impresses, Simple Delivers: Your instinct will be to pursue the flashy, sophisticated AI applications that sound impressive in board presentations. Resist it. The organizations generating real ROI start with mundane problems: expense report processing, meeting summarization, competitive monitoring, etc. These boring use cases build organizational confidence and create the foundation for more ambitious projects. Your People Know Where the Problems Are: The best AI applications emerge from the intersection of daily frustration and technological possibility. Run hackathons. Create cross-functional workshops. Ask your teams what they do that feels like waste. The solutions they surface will be more practical and impactful than anything your consultants recommend. Start Here Stop looking for AI opportunities everywhere. Focus your organization's attention on three specific areas where AI creates immediate, measurable value. The Tedium Tax: Every role in your organization includes mind-numbing tasks that consume time without creating value: data entry, compliance documentation, procurement reports, staff vacation tracking, etc. Think of these as your "Anti To-Do List." These are tasks systematically eliminated by asking, "How can I never have to do this again?" Your teams are paying a tedium tax every day. AI is the refund. The Expertise Bottleneck: Projects stall when teams hit the limits of their skills and wait for other departments. Marketing needs data analysis and campaign design mockups. Finance and HR need custom GPTs. Sales needs meetings-related technical specifications translated into customer language. AI breaks these bottlenecks by giving every team superpowers they never had before. The Blank Page Problem: Knowledge work involves ambiguous challenges where the path forward isn't clear: Strategy development, market analysis, problem diagnosis, etc. AI excels at generating multiple approaches, analyzing incomplete information, and proposing next steps when your teams are stuck. It's the thinking partner that's always available and never runs out of ideas. 6 Use Cases OpenAI's analysis of 600+ successful implementations across various industries reveals that virtually every valuable AI application falls into one of six categories. Show your teams these six use cases and they'll start finding opportunities everywhere. Content Creation: Use AI for first drafts of everything: strategy documents, marketing campaigns, product and experience descriptions, customer and community communications. AI maintains your brand voice while eliminating the blank page problem. Research and Synthesis: AI powers information gathering at superhuman speed, including market analysis, competitive intelligence, customer feedback synthesis, regulatory research, etc.. AI doesn't just find information. It structures it exactly how you need it for decision-making. Coding for Everyone: Your non-technical teams can now write Python scripts, SQL queries, and data visualizations. Your engineering teams debug faster and prototype in unfamiliar languages. AI democratizes technical capability while accelerating your experts. Data Analysis Without Degrees: Upload spreadsheets, dashboard screenshots or raw data files and get structured analysis without requiring PhD-level statistics knowledge. This is arguably the most undervalued opportunity that delivers immediate results for most DMOs. Strategic Thinking Partner: AI is a beast for brainstorming, scenario planning, product and event development, asset mapping, risk analysis, etc. AI helps structure complex problems and identifies considerations your teams might miss. This is my favorite use case for AI. Intelligent Automation: Use platforms like n8n, Relay and others to create repeatable processes that run themselves, such as weekly competitive updates, financial reporting, sales and marketing workflows, a ton of admin duties, etc. Create the process once, then let AI handle the execution while humans focus on exceptions and strategy. Implementation is Where DMOs Fail Most AI initiatives fail because organizations treat them like traditional software deployments. They're not. AI is about change management and behavioral transformation up and down the org chart. AI implementation requires different approaches to discovery, prioritization and scaling. Systematic Opportunity Hunting: Don't wait for AI use cases to emerge organically. Run structured discovery sessions where teams audit their workflows for repetitive tasks, skill bottlenecks, and ambiguous challenges. Make this process ongoing, not a one-time exercise. The Impact-Effort Matrix: Not every AI opportunity deserves attention. Prioritize based on business impact versus implementation effort. Quick wins build momentum. High-value, high-effort projects become strategic investments. Everything else gets parked until technology makes it easier. Innovation as Culture: Internal competitions accelerate discovery while building AI literacy across your organization. The goal isn't technical sophistication. It's practical business solutions that teams actually want to use. Measure What Matters: Track time saved, accuracy improved, costs reduced and capability expansion. But also measure qualitative impacts: employee satisfaction, process improvements, competitive advantages. Use this data to guide scaling decisions. Build Your AI Process Move beyond random experimentation to systematic capability building. I like Estée Lauder's 5-phase process to ensure repeatable success with AI. Does this resonate with you for your DMO? Design: Define your purpose, scope and success criteria for AI integration in a 2-page brief. No scope creep. No technical complexity for its own sake. Prepare: Ask department heads to gather relevant data and best practices. AI tools should reflect organizational knowledge, not generic approaches. Build and Test: Hire contractors where necessary to help teams develop automations/agents, implement training, integrate datasets and validate accuracy. Focus on usability, not just functionality. Launch: Deploy with user guides and change management support. Technology deployment is easy. User adoption across all departments is a total headache at first. Optimize: Feedback loops drive continuous improvement based on actual usage patterns. AI applications evolve with business needs and improved capabilities. Key Insight: Always start with fundamental questions: Why build this? What problem does it solve? What impact will it have? Is the measurement for success quantitative or qualitative? Organizations that answer these questions clearly will build more successful AI applications than those focused primarily on technical capability. Build AI-Native Workflows The most sophisticated implementations integrate AI across entire business processes rather than individual tasks. This evolution positions organizations for the agentic AI capabilities coming next. Process Decomposition: Break complex workflows into constituent tasks, identify where each AI use case category adds value, and create integrated approaches spanning from research through execution. Marketing workflows might integrate research for market understanding, analysis for opportunity mapping, ideation for strategy, content creation for product and destination development, and automation for distribution. Cross-Functional Integration: AI facilitates better collaboration by translating between departments. Technical specifications become marketing language. Customer requirements inform sales priorities. Financial models drive strategic planning. Future-Proofing for Agents: Current workflow integration prepares your organization for AI agents that can complete entire projects independently. Teams that understand how to break processes into AI-addressable components will leverage these capabilities immediately when available. The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done. This cognitive shift creates advantages that compound over time and become increasingly difficult for competitors to replicate. "The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done." Key Takeaways The question isn't whether AI will transform our industry. It's whether you'll be leading that transformation or reacting to it. Start with clear, achievable use cases and systemic approaches to build the organizational muscle needed for transformation. AI advantage isn't about having the most technical teams or biggest budgets. It's about developing capabilities for organization-wide discovery, adoption, implementation and scaling of practical business solutions. The organizations moving beyond experimentation to systematic implementation today will be best positioned to leverage the more sophisticated AI capabilities emerging tomorrow. The agents are coming. Will you be ready? Greg Oates

The ROI of AI Agents Aug 21 Written By Greg Oates Based on a bunch of conversations at DI Annual 2025 this month, it's clear that many DMO executives still equate generative AI primarily with writing and editing in ChatGPT. But as one COO of a large U.S. DMO told me, "Surely there's more to all this than just learning about prompting." So many ways to respond to that. Meanwhile, there are also DMO leaders who established AI road maps for their organizations going back two years. For them, they're increasingly focused on developing AI-powered automated workflows and their more sophisticated cousins, AI agents. The purpose of these synthetic workflows is to automate tedious, time-consuming and repetitive tasks to free up staff to focus on more high-value work. Think of it as an evolution from using AI to building AI. You begin by visually mapping what people do in your organization. Then you identify where AI can potentially take over all the mundane stuff better and faster. I’ve been working with my colleagues at Matador Network to develop automated workflows for our Studio team. We have endless terabytes of client video created during the last 10 years. Now, with AI, we want to capitalize on those existing assets to create new video, but first we need to use AI to understand what we actually own. We contracted Erick Bonilla , founder of Pocho.tech based in Uruguay, to build a series of new AI workflows in n8n. One of the automations is designed to cull through 10 years of video files in Dropbox and catalogue everything in Airtable. The AI then creates standardized file names, project IDs, links for raw edited videos and finished client hero/cutdown videos, and location and content tags. The cost to develop the AI workflow was about $2,000 all-in, and it saved more than a month of work at a mid-level manager salary. The beauty of automations/agents is you can measure ROI annually fairly easily, which will help wake up your board if they're sleeping on AI. Moreover, once an automation is in place, the savings will continue to accrue in the future indefinitely for tasks still required, and there’s zero human error. During a staff Zoom, I asked members of our Studio team if they felt these new agents signaled to them the beginning of the end of some people’s jobs. The response was unanimous. Nobody wants to do this type of repetitive grunt work. I spoke with Bonilla for his take on the future of AI agents. Greg Oates: Erick, what services does Pocho.tech provide? Erick Bonilla: We identify opportunities within organizations of all sizes, where we believe implementing AI systems can dramatically improve the efficiency of operations. We can create workflows that process data, or we can create AI agents capable of reasoning, analyzing data, creating reports, and providing decision-makers with an enhanced way of digesting information. I have been doing this for almost two years, working with people mostly in the Middle East, the US and Latin America. The Pocha company site is brand new as I try to expand in the world of AI. GO: What’s the difference between automated workflows and agents? EB: A workflow is like a mass production factory. It's a set of operations that work through specific logic to automate a repetitive process that a human has done before. This could be writing and reading emails, writing summaries, reformatting and transferring content through different tools and applications, etc. An AI agent is a thinking environment that makes decisions for you. You can set a workflow for reading your emails. But then you can have an AI agent that summarizes your emails and tells you, if you have 10 emails, what those 10 emails are about in just one email, SMS text, WhatsApp message, Google doc or whatever. GO: So an AI agent has more autonomy and decision-making capabilities than an automated workflow? EB: Definitely. The AI agent is capable of being completely autonomous to make decisions within a given context. You give it a context with defined restrictions that narrows the scope of the decisions it can make. GO: Can you provide any success stories where you worked with a client who had a specific challenge, and you created an automated workflow or agent that successfully delivered a solution? EB: The most recent example is an EdTech company in Boston that provides a training and placement program for clean energy jobs. They've been operating for the past five years, but there’s been a lack of funds, employees and program applicants to scale beyond Massachusetts. So they decided to use AI and automation to build flows without having to invest a lot of money in hiring people. What I did was streamline the application process for people interested in entering the educational program. We created a form and a workflow that takes the information from the application and puts it into an application tracking system. This system has workflows that can trigger emails, daily reports, weekly reports and invitations to interview. Then I created an AI agent. Once the applicants are interviewed by a human, we take the transcript of that, analyze it using AI, and build a report for the decision maker so they can decide if this person is capable of entering the program or not. We also created a scoring system. We built it based on human criteria, which is subjective, and then we converted that into an objective dataset so we could classify people and score them based on numbers. All of this is done by an AI agent that sets a score for the applicant at the end of the interview. Then we have a leaderboard where people are ranked, and the top 15 get into the education program and placement process. GO: Were they happy with the end result? EB: Oh yeah, very happy. Here's where the beauty and magic come in. Now the CEO can envision a way of expanding outside Massachusetts, and tell her team, "Hey, we're going to New York!" Where before, she thought she needed to hire more people in each new state to oversee the operation. And, because an AI agent works 24/7, she doesn't have to wait until 8am to get a report or transcription, or anything anymore. So now, she can think about how to scale her company more successfully without having to hire more people. GO: What's the road map looking ahead? Where are you going with the company in terms of next steps? EB: We're trying to create an outreach system because the purpose of the company is not only to train people but also to place them in clean tech job positions. The outreach system is going to help the team find more companies with open positions, so the company can place more people in those positions. We’re building a system involving AI agents and workflows where we're going to take a picture of all the open positions and analyze and understand them using AI. We want to know, what are the requirements in terms of learning and knowledge capacity for people to get in these positions, so the company can build a better training program. GO: What was the biggest challenge working with them? EB: I think the most important one, and this is something anyone working on this will experience, is the resistance of some team members who don't trust the performance of AI enough. People who have low experience working with AI, and maybe only know ChatGPT, will look at this and say, "I don't believe this can work." So that means there’s a lot of educational work. People need enough knowledge about what AI tools are capable of to suggest what can and can’t work. I think that's the main challenge. But once people see it working, they start to lean into AI. Suddenly, they become like, "This is great. Can you add this other metric? Can you make it do this other thing too? Can you make me one for my personal side hustle?" It's interesting when you see people moving from resistance to acceptance. GO: Working with you has firmly cemented something I've been preoccupied with this year. It's this: One of the most exciting things about AI, which is giving us more time back during the day, requires the most boring thing, which is having uniform file and data structure. As we've discovered together only too well, AI can't reach its full potential unless you have everything structured super cleanly. The analogy I often use is that AI is like an 8-year-old savant. The person is brilliant but he or she often needs really consistent environments and clear guardrails, or things go sideways or just crash. Can you talk about what any organization needs to focus on when it comes to file and data structure? EB: I think one of the most basic things, and I'm living this with a company I'm helping right now, is documenting files and folders exactly the same. You must set protocols for everything when you’re building a folder system to store content and data. That's one of the biggest challenges for companies trying to implement AI automation with poorly standardized systems. When we didn’t have AI a few years ago, we didn't think of a machine reading our documents or files. We never thought that could be possible, so we never really focused on creating really good file structure. The biggest challenge for companies, coming back to Matador, is how to organize the field of play so that AI doesn't struggle. We easily lose the excitement of implementing AI in an organization when an AI is trying to navigate a maze of poorly organized files. For that, you need to build SOPs that tell everyone on the team, “We're going to be naming files this way now so that a 5-year-old can read the titles and understand what's in every one of them. Because if a 5-year-old can read this set of folders and understand what's inside all of them, then AI can do that too. And if AI can find and read everything, then AI can do some truly amazing things and save companies a lot of money. GO: So how are organizations like ours, which have been in operation for a long time, supposed to go back decades and reorganize all our files? EB: We can run a workflow that can do that for you. That's where the ROI comes in. You can make a one-time investment building a workflow that's going to completely standardize all your filing and foldering. But if you do that, you have to know that the ROI might not show up right away. It's going to start paying off later in terms of the time, money, stress and everything it’s going to give back. A CEO must understand that the return on that investment is going to be ongoing through the years, not in the next quarter necessarily. If you have that mentality, then your company is going to become AI-first. GO: You’ve told me before that AI is not a tool, it's a culture. Can you explain that? EB: Right now, the biggest obstacle for AI expanding in many companies are the CEOs. I understand the challenges because they fear a lot of reputational risk. You have a board and customers that are going to be judging you. If you don't have a very good AI road map, then it could turn into a failure, and the fingers are going to be pointing at you. I understand that completely. But AI should be a culture within companies, and that starts top down because the CEO has to embrace trial and error. AI is going to fail at least during the first time you start with any automation. It's like when you're building a prompt. We were talking the other day, and you said using AI is not about writing the perfect first prompt. It's that fifth or sixth prompt that's going to get you to the right answer. You're going to be iterating with automation, too. That's something CEOs have to transmit throughout the organization. GO: I think for many tourism organizations, we haven’t even begun talking about the big picture value of AI. From an internal perspective, for example, agents offer a whole new level for optimizing operations with AI. EB: Yes, exactly. When we're in a company and we're facing challenges, the first intuitive thinking is, "How can I solve this? I'm going to Google it.” Now we're transitioning to, "How can I solve this? I'm going to ask ChatGPT.” This is great, but that's not AI-first. That's changing one tool for another. You're still browsing. It's literally the same thing. You're not really using AI. AI-first means, "I do this thing that's consuming 10 hours a week. I do the same thing every time. I spend two hours every day doing the same four steps. How can I use AI to automate this?" That's AI-first because you're using AI to stop wasting time. I think that's the culture we should be striving for. If a CEO injects the whole company with that mindset, then the employees are going to eventually use AI to solve their issues more independently and autonomously. At the end of the day, what AI really does is gives us more time and more of our lives back, and we have not yet understood that because it's new. But it's true, AI is the way for humans to have more life. GO: I want that. EB: We all do. GO: I have this belief that eventually, in any organization, all meetings will be recorded and deposited into a central knowledge base where an AI can summarize everything and connect all the key takeaways. I might have a meeting and someone on the other side of the world has a meeting, and the AI will know we're talking about the same thing. It will see and surface how there's potential opportunity to connect our efforts. It's like one plus one equals three, or more. Do you think that's where we're going and that it will benefit companies? EB: Definitely. It's the most common sense thing to do, but I know it's also counterintuitive because there are many people who would not like to have all conversations recorded. The fidelity, the accuracy of the information, and it all being in one place and uniformly structured, is everything. You can have thousands of conversations and tell the AI, "Go here and search for this specific idea in all the transcripts where we have talked about that." You just need to build the SOPs. Then a human can quality control it and say, "This is right. This isn't right. Maybe we can tweak this, or build on that." GO: I’ve experienced this firsthand where people are vehemently against this idea of all company meetings being recorded. For many it portends that clichéd dystopic future we see in science fiction, where everything's controlled and you have no freedom, right? EB: I can see it too. We must remember that these tools can be turned off. If we let the technology control us, then that's on us. I think at the end of the day, it's about how do you balance the risk and rewards? This is something CEOs are used to. Do you prefer to live in blindness and have an uncompetitive company because you decided not to take that risk with automation? Or do you take the risk and have everything recorded, even though some people are going to say it’s Orwellian in a way, and even though ultimately it's going to improve everybody's life? We have to find that balance, and that’s the CEO’s role to determine what’s best overall for the company, customers and employees in the future. GO: Any last thoughts? EB: I think we are not quite there yet to know for sure the amount of ROI that is going to come from agents and automations. Definitely it is going to be positive ROI. For that, I'm completely sure. What I'm not sure is how do we measure ROI based on the anticipated lifetime value of the process? So much is changing so quickly and it's difficult to see the future. As the tools get better, then the workflow gets better too, so the ROI increases, right? Except, we don't really have models for that. For CEOs, I think, they have to try to envision how they can measure the value of automations now, and how that might evolve exponentially in the future. Greg Oates

What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates CEOs at destination marketing and management organizations (DMOs) are seeking AI guidance specifically tailored to their chief executive roles. A CEO in the U.S. told me recently that current AI education is often too surface level, vague, unstructured, or trying to cover too much ground to be useful for a chief executive. He said, "We've been talking for a while now about how we need AI education targeting leadership, but it doesn't really exist." While destination leaders face many more questions about AI than answers, one thing is 100% clear: CEOs must own and lead their organizations' AI integration across all departments. AI isn't something to outsource or delegate to others, and it's not a "marketing thing" for the CMO to figure out. Conor Grennan , chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, consults with clients on AI strategy from JPMorgan to NASA. I asked him how important it is for CEOs to lead AI education, adoption and integration across their organizations. “CEOs have to understand how to use AI and why; they really have to have felt the delight about what AI can do,” he said. "They also have to see clearly how AI is a leadership and change management challenge, not a tech challenge. Then they need to start out being vulnerable, and be able to say, ‘Hey, I was skeptical about AI. I didn’t understand it, either. But now I can explain the way I learned it and how to communicate why it’s important to help other people understand it.” So why do CEOs need to understand AI? Jeff Bezos answered that at The New York Times DealBook Summit last year. He described how “modern AI is a horizontal enabling layer" that will soon be integrated into every device and digital application in existence. "These kind of horizontal layers like electricity and compute and now artificial intelligence, they go everywhere," he said. "I guarantee you there is not a single application that you can think of that is not going to be made better by AI." Here's the clip: Strategic AI Approaches I met with about a dozen CEOs in North America to find out what they want to know about AI specifically from a CEO perspective. Some leaders are seeking big-picture guidance with a broad overview of high-level strategy. "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” one CEO told me. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" Another chief executive said, “We see three areas of opportunity for AI: Administrative tasks and general productivity; marketing chat, SEO and data readiness; and helping customers find information about our city more effectively.… The two most important things I want to know are how to develop AI policy and how is AI changing SEO." A year ago, most CEOs had a wait-and-see attitude about AI, following how the technology evolved and what their cohorts in other organizations were doing. Today, there is a general consensus among CEOs that they need to invest in AI, but the question is how and where. One CEO told me he knows he needs to integrate AI tools and processes into his DMO, but he has three overarching questions that he wants answered first, at least at a high level: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” Other CEOs are seeking clarity on the basic fundamentals of AI: "I need to understand what are the problems that we're trying to solve with AI. What is the purpose of a chatbot, for example? What am I buying, and what can we as an organization accomplish with it?" And then others just want immediate actionable solutions: "I'm not interested in hypotheticals. Show me five ways I can implement AI on Monday. Give me turnkey AI solutions that work today." AI Data is King Personalized data is one of generative AI’s biggest value propositions. Conversational AI (chat) is the new marketplace, and it’s eating the entire funnel including in-destination engagement. In some cities, AI chat conversations between DMOs and visitors is exceeding 25% in-destination, giving DMOs a way to influence visitor behavior in real time. Also, in some industry segments like tours and activities, in-chat conversations are driving in-destination bookings with partners like GetYourGuide. Everyone is looking for first/zero-party data around that. “We have a low level of proprietary data about who is in our destination and what they’re doing,” asserted one CEO. “We have a few disparate data sources, but we need to connect those, and we want to be able to use it predictively. For example, we're looking at regression analysis to help develop future scenario modeling, and we're looking at AI to help us with that." Another CEO said, “We need data that provides material value for our partners. That’s our mandate. How are our visitors spending money and where? How are they behaving and traveling through our area? How can we help people find our partners in a more personalized way?” And one CEO added, "A key priority for us is figuring out the data equation so outbound messaging can be tailored to a 1-on-1 relationship.” Striving for that direct individual customer engagement has been the holy grail for marketers for decades. The ability to deliver mass personalization at scale is now coming into focus with enhanced AI data curation. National organizations like Destination Canada and Germany Travel have invested millions of dollars in data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to restructure their tourism product data from scratch, capitalize on the data more effectively to rank higher in AI search, and drive incremental revenue to partners. That's what the future looks like. For more information, check out the new Canadian Tourism Data Collective and Germany's Open Data Project . Today, local tourism organizations are starting to see how data structure and content architecture are strategic imperatives for them, too. One municipal CEO explained, "I think it might almost be too early to have this conversation in some areas until AI matures more. One thing I am eager to know now is how do we develop a data lake to structure our own data and messaging to make it easier for AI search tools to find." AI search and SEO are a huge conversation today. During the past year, the #1 question I heard while speaking about AI with dozens of North American destination organizations, their boards and key industry/community stakeholders, was: How do we rank higher in AI search? What happens when AI buries organic content? What’s going to happen to our websites? Are they going to disappear? Is a DMO without a website still a DMO? How do we need to produce content differently? And, what the heck is a data lake? One CEO I spoke with is planning on developing a new website for her organization. She said, "I don't even know what I don't know about AI search, but we need to figure some of that out before we start spending any money." Along with data, defining KPIs for AI integration is a hot topic of debate, and presently there isn’t a complete and codified list of metrics that DMO leaders agree on. That said, perhaps the travel and tourism industry collectively needs to understand what AI is, and what it can accomplish at scale, before attaching too many metrics to it. A CMO told me at DI MarCom Summit this month, “People didn’t ask about ROI with the internet when it first came around. We just knew we had to have it,” because it was a new channel for reaching visitors. Same as AI now. Expanding on that, he suggested that DMOs need to break AI success tracking into awareness metrics and performance metrics, and get that conversation right before anything else. Staff AI Adoption Unlike previous technology evolutions, there doesn’t seem to be as much of a generational divide between early adopters of AI and everyone else. The industry can’t look to Gen Z for guidance about how to use AI to the same degree we once asked Millennials for insights about Instagram. Again, driving AI adoption across an organization begins with the CEO. Once that’s established, the real challenge is convincing department leaders and staff to lean into AI. It's a challenge because there is widespread concern, skepticism and/or suspicion among many staff members across many industries that they’re being asked to learn new technologies that will eventually replace them. Leadership should say to employees that no one can force them to use AI, but the job market will. The data is clear. According to the Linkedin/Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index : 79% of leaders agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with Al skills than a more experienced one without 66% of leaders won’t hire someone without AI skills 60% of leaders worry their organization lacks a plan and vision to implement AI And that's a year old. But, understandably, emphasizing those numbers comes across as threatening. A better strategy for driving AI adoption is finding staff members who are already seeing success with AI, supporting them with access to education and pro AI models, and working out from there. The more employees see their colleagues using AI, the more some of them feel inclined to lean in. Therefore, every DMO needs a comprehensive strategic AI road map that includes purpose, policy, education, integration and a continuous feedback loop across all levels of staff. CEOs need to create a space for that. "We're giving our staff time to play around with AI, but they have to present what they're focusing on and what they're learning to their individual supervisor," a CEO told me. Another added, “We're focusing on staff adoption. But I need you to explain to me what works, how to implement, and what should I watch out for." I'm presently working with our departments at Matador Network to explore a bunch of various AI models to optimize workflows, boost creativity, enhance strategic planning, diversify product, etc. There's a well-communicated mandate from the top that Matador will become an AI-first company, and sooner than later. To help accelerate that, we created an AI task force to bring more perspectives from across the company together to integrate AI into operations. That has been valuable with some immediate takeaways, such as staff is now reaching out and asking for assistance with AI. But it's only a start. "There's this idea that if you can get a core group of people using AI then their attitudes and behaviors will spread organically throughout the rest of the company," said Conor Grennan at NYU. "It doesn't work that way. You have to find the people who have fears about AI and listen to them to understand why. You have to say, 'Yes, AI does suck at that, but here's what it's good at.' You also need to weed out the negative people who are against AI outright. They're dangerous." 5 Key Takeaways Let's go back to that first CEO who wants to know the five big questions about AI. Based on the input from the above CEOs, here's a first stab at that: How can I create AI policy that serves our organization but doesn't suppress experimentation among staff? (Interestingly, policy did not come up that much with the CEOs I spoke with.) How do we need to develop our websites, content and data to rank higher in AI search? How is AI SEO different, and the same, as old SEO? What are existing AI chat platforms accomplishing, how are visitors using them, and how are they influencing travel decision making and purchase behavior? If AI is not just for marketing, what does the ecosystem of AI tools for all departments look like across the organization? And what do they do in terms of increasing productivity, creativity and quality? How do I get staff to buy in? We know AI is an imperative for our organization's competitive advantage and relevance. And we know AI is an imperative for employees for their professional growth and marketability. But how do we get our people to really believe in the need to embrace AI? Greg Oates

Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Royce Chwin, president and CEO of Destination Vancouver , personifies how a DMO chief executive needs to establish and articulate the mandate for integrating AI across the organization. That was the topic of our last Destination AI post where 12 CEOs explained: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . Early in 2024, Chwin addressed the full staff in Destination Vancouver’s office before a session I was presenting there on AI. “We cannot not do this,” he said, stating that the organization needed to adopt AI processes to stay relevant in the industry and increase its value in the community. If Destination Vancouver is positioning itself as an innovative DMO, he explained, then the road ahead with AI was clear. Since then, Destination Vancouver launched a new website fully integrated with AI where visitors can customize how they find travel information. The build was a two-year process requiring an inordinate amount of learning to capitalize on generative AI. The team also developed an AI policy guide that Chwin shared for this post. The comprehensive document is designed to "provide clear protocols that maximize and encourage the use of Al tools where appropriate and safe to do so, while minimizing any potential risks and concerns." The policy guide encourages staff to use AI for "enhancing productivity, efficiency, creativity or decision-making." It defines when not to use AI models and how staff is required to review and validate all AI outputs for accuracy and bias. Also, Stefan Hawes, vp of global marketing, initiated the development of an internal AI Council, bringing together a diverse group of staff to coordinate AI processes across the organization. Chwin shared an internal briefing report outlining the purpose of the Council as follows: It is recommended that an AI Council be established immediately to provide a centralized body for managing AI-related initiatives and to expand training opportunities for team members. The Council will focus on: Setting strategic priorities related to AI Selecting use cases, implementing projects/initiatives/AI software purchases and evaluating their effectiveness Developing a data strategy to support AI adoption and initiatives Developing an AI education, literacy and adoption program Ensuring ethical compliance Fostering cross-departmental collaboration to maximize the impact of AI projects We created a similar AI task force at Matador, and the value of that cannot be overstated to better assess how staff from different departments perceive, and misperceive, AI in general. I talked with Chwin this week to better understand how a DMO CEO can best lead strategic AI implementation across his or her organization. The purpose of this post is to help inform, inspire and influence other CEOs to consider the opportunities of AI in a new light. Greg Oates: Royce, you've been a strident proponent of AI for a couple years now, and yet there are many other CEOs who are still reticent. How did you personally come to decide Destination Vancouver needed to embrace AI? Royce Chwin: The perception still of some DMOs is that we are behind when it comes to technology. We're slow to adapt. We're slow to evolve. You see all these other organizations in the travel sphere around us that are able to move much quicker. They might be capitalized better. They can adjust. They can pivot quicker to take on these new technologies, and they can experiment seemingly without the degree of fear or consternation that maybe some DMOs have. So, I think there's lots of different reasons. For us, I mean, it's day and night. We can't not do that. Our entire ecosystem that we play in has some level of AI being used. Number one is our customers. They’re using AI. So it goes back to that same idea that you and I have discussed many times before: How do we as a DMO stay relevant and how do we show value? AI is a response to answering those two things. GO: In many organizations today, there’s often skepticism and suspicion among staff about how AI might take their jobs, or they’re dismissive of AI altogether. How does your team feel about AI overall? RC: I'm not finding a fear in our organization for using AI. I think it's a different set of challenges. I think there are so many derivatives of AI out there that people don't know what to focus on. Because you can’t and don't need to focus on 40 different AI tools. The question is, what are the best tools that are most relevant to the work that I need to do? That, I think, in my experience is a bigger challenge. My sense of it is that AI can be so overwhelming. It can seem unbelievably complicated. So we had to ask ourselves, do we have the time, resources and skill sets to simply understand it? Secondly, are we asking better questions to understand what in the organization we need to solve, and can AI help? GO: In a previous post, I shared input from 12 DMO CEOs about how they feel about AI. What are you hearing from other CEOs? RC: I was over in Europe recently for Destinations International’s Global Leaders Forum where I was onstage with Sherrif Karamat (CEO of PCMA) and Petra Stušek (CEO at Ljubljana Tourism). We were talking about the importance of face-to-face meetings and so on, and Sherrif made a comment that DMOs are really behind using AI. It was kind of a blanket statement, and he's not wrong. But, I said to Sheriff that I think a lot of DMOs are behind because it's like throwing confetti in somebody's face and asking them to pick the best pieces. They don't even know what they're trying to evaluate, and it’s also moving so fast. In the meantime, our customers are running around us using AI for all kinds of things. And so I think that there's not so much a fear of using AI. It’s more that people are questioning how to respond to the increasing emergence of AI because they’re thinking, “I'm not really 100% clear on the business problem I'm trying to solve that supports my mandate.” For us, and you saw it when you visited, we were really clear on what it is that we needed to do. We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI. “We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI.” GO: I’ve been asserting that CEOs should own and lead AI adoption in their organizations to have the best chance for success. I don't mean lead it day to day. I mean the chief executive must establish the mandate that AI is something the organization is going to invest in, and articulate why and how to the entire staff. Connor Grennan, chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, emphasized to me that’s the only way this works. Do you agree? RC: Yes, I absolutely believe it must come from the CEO because the CEO has to clear the vision with the team. And with something as seismic as AI, and how it’s evolving in our daily life, in our world, I think the CEO has a responsibility to address it and how it will impact the organization. Everyone needs to understand how we’re going to use AI in alignment with our mission and strategic goals, and how it will support the mandate. That's all CEO level. That's the responsibility on my head. Also, I can't imagine going in front of my Board and asking, “Hey, what are you doing with AI? What should we do with AI?” So it has to come from the CEO, but my Board has also enabled me. Like, there's no grief from my Board. Zero. We are fully enabled. GO: You've created the necessary structure to help govern AI integration with your AI Policy and AI Council. Can you expand on the thinking behind those? RC: We developed an AI policy that’s designed to enable people to use AI and not discourage them from experimenting. Obviously, some education is required in terms of proprietary information and those kinds of things. But we're really leaning into this and we're going to assign some time for it to enable the organization to experiment and play with AI without fear of reprisal. Naturally there needs to be governance around it, but governance does not mean stopping creativity. Governance means we’re creating and delivering new opportunities for creativity. There just needs to be structure around that. Also, Stefan came up with the idea of pulling together an AI Council in the organization, which I think is fantastic. We're getting individuals from each business line, including myself, and we’re going to talk about AI, its impacts, what we need to be thinking about, and how we'll improve our website and the organization as a whole. So we're creating dialogue around it to define opportunities. For example, I'm really excited about AI as it relates to all the country market analysis that we do. We've been doing that by spreadsheet, but now we’re exploring AI to provide the insights we need to inform our market planning more effectively. There are lots of different examples like that, but you only discover them by being open to experimenting with AI. Greg Oates

Toronto & Denver Tourism Leaders on the 5 Big AI Questions for CEOs Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates A year from now, the travel and tourism sector might look back and thank Andrew Weir, president and CEO of Destination Toronto , for catalyzing how DMOs move forward with AI. At PCMA Convening Leaders in January this year, I asked Weir what CEOs need to understand about AI at a high level. Numerous other CEOs have told me there’s a complete lack of AI education specifically designed for DMO chief executives. His answer was first shared anonymously in our previous post, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” said Weir. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" At the end of that post I suggested what those five questions might be based on all the CEO insights in there, and I've since been shopping them around to vet them. A few weeks ago, for example, Richard Scharf, president and CEO at Visit Denver , suggested restructuring the questions to create a more logical hierarchy. Now, the first three deal with internal operations while the last two identify external, visitor-facing priorities. Yesterday, I spoke again with Weir, as well as Paula Port, vice president of marketing at Destination Toronto, for their input on the five questions. The goal here is to provide clear structure around AI platforms and processes for DMOs leading up to Matador Network’s collaboration with U.S. Travel at ESTO in Phoenix this fall. Together, we’ll be co-hosting an interactive, multi-station “AI Playground” educational activation during the three days of the conference. Here are the five big AI questions. These will evolve but now we have a foundation to begin building consensus on how DMOs can capitalize on opportunities and navigate challenges with AI today. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The 5 Big AI Questions 1. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? A growing number of DMO leaders say their teams embrace AI for the most part, and many are actively developing basic AI strategy. That’s a significant shift from a year ago. At the same time, there's still varying degrees of cynicism and skepticism about AI in other organizations. I asked Weir about his staff. “I don't feel like we're dragging the team into this,” he said. “It's really more a matter of how people are at such different places with AI. So our goal is figuring out how to channel all their knowledge and energy, and kind of align and unify that, without stifling anyone’s creativity.” Scharf at Visit Denver emphasized that this question should be the first one, because successful AI integration begins with understanding your staff’s grasp of AI and their appetite for leaning into it. “ChatGPT is growing like Zoom did a few years ago so we know we need to use it,” he said. “The first thing we did was survey staff to assess how they feel about AI, and how or if they’re using it. Then we started off with small bites like email. Now we think of AI as a toolkit, and we're continuing to explore what tools are appropriate for different needs.” Port added that AI integration across teams works best with both structured and self-directed learning. “We started by making everything (ChatGPT Plus, Google Gemini) available to everyone, so they were given access to tools and resources, but a lot of this is really self-directed learning,” she said. “What we're seeing now is people have taken advantage of that and moved forward with it. Some maybe a little bit further than others, so maybe we need to address that. I think we still need more use cases and more structured learning because we're not all at the same level in terms of knowing and understanding how to put AI to use.” 2. How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? Destination Toronto was one of the first North American municipal DMOs to develop an AI policy. They began the process by pulling examples from larger government-operated tourism organizations including Destination Canada and Destination British Columbia. “We set up that policy structure first in terms of what we wanted as an organization, and also being very clear that any use of AI was meant to drive business results,” said Weir. “I think we were able to get there pretty quickly because we didn't create a series of regulations. We built a series of philosophies and principles to guide where we go. It was meant to put guardrails around protecting information, while at the same time, stimulate learning and sharing. Because we said to the team that you are free and encouraged to use AI, but there is an expectation that you will share what you've learned.” Port explained further that, “We leveraged existing processes already in place from a content perspective in terms of bias, IT usage, etc. We have an assessment process for any sort of software application that we're looking to use, so we did the same with AI.” (Note: The next GuideGeek Destination AI post will be with Kara Franker, president and CEO of Visit Florida Keys, who is also an attorney. We discussed AI policy at length.) 3. How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? Scharf stated that integrating AI platforms and processes beyond marketing is “where all the work is happening now.” His organization is switching out regular stand up meetings with extended AI workshops and visiting speakers to learn more about AI tools for various use cases across departments. Leadership, he said, including himself, are present at these meetings so everyone is learning together. Weir and Port both addressed this question, saying they need to first explore how Simpleview, Cvent and other tech partners are integrating AI functionality before looking at any new AI platforms. We discussed PCMA’s Project Spark , an AI-native event development tool that includes the new Destinaitor destination sourcing platform. DMO leadership and sales teams are exploring Spark to understand how clients are using new AI software to evaluate, compare and source destinations for business events. Others, like Kara Franker mentioned above, are looking for new AI solutions to optimize their HR and accounting departments, but she said many of the available options presently are only enterprise grade. Something DMOs should really look at, and I’m not sure how/if many already are, but there is proven value in creating custom GPTs for sales teams. GPTs are like mini ChatGPTs designed for specific purposes that anyone with a ChatGPT Plus account can create. For example, a sales rep can build a knowledge base inside a GPT by uploading sales materials, examples of successful bids, product information, pricing, team members, case studies, testimonials and other data. The next step is to develop internal GPT instructions to direct what the GPT does and what it prioritizes. Following that, the rep can then chat with the GPT and ask it to create a customized bid for a potential client that pulls all relevant source materials from the knowledge base that best supports the pitch. I’m imagining the ability to create custom GPTs is going to soon be a standard and required capability for all sales teams. One of the earliest enterprise examples of this was Salesforce’s Einstein GPT, which has since morphed into Agentforce. We use them at Matador because of improved efficiency and quality. GPTs also provide a new option for creative brainstorming, which some salespeople appreciate who don't identify as being super creative. Increases in sales production can be clearly identified. However, there's increasing conversation about tracking success in other departments. When AI delivers clear improvements in efficiency and saves people significant time, how do you measure that? One concern is that people will then just work a six hour day versus eight hours. The common thinking is that organizations will need to adjust productivity benchmarks, but this is a messy conversation. I don’t know enough to comment on that yet, but I wanted to put a pin in it because it’s something we’ll all need to look at eventually as AI scales in the workforce. 4. How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? I was addressing Visit Denver’s Board a while back and one member suggested that DMOs won’t need websites soon because they’ll be replaced by a ChatGPT-like window. I’m surprised by how much this comes up. For one thing, DMOs will always need some kind of online knowledge base for AI search queries. If anything, that will require more content and more comprehensive product information because AI search thrives more than anything on data structure, clarity and specificity. That said, the web user interface will likely evolve considerably. Expect to hear a lot more about how DMOs are developing data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to optimize data structure for AI search. For further context, here's a Perplexity Pro response to the question: "Are tourism boards developing data lakes and warehouses to optimize their sites for AI search?" Weir suggested that this conversation about the future of websites is not unlike what we went through 15 years ago, when people were lamenting the death of DMO sites because social media was deemed by some as the new web. More important, he asserted, is seeing how AI search is evolving and being prepared to adapt strategy. “I think there is a push-pull here between how we lead and where customers are at,” said Weir. “We want to deliver more information through our AI assistant and AI search in general, but customers aren't really there yet. I don't know what the percentage is, but the majority of people are still using Google. They're still beginning an interaction on the web by entering search terms in Google the traditional way. At some point, that's going to flip, right? It's going to be a few percent more each month or quarter, whatever that is. But how far ahead of it do we get? And how do we calibrate? We can try to lead on this, but you know, we also have to stay in step with where our customers are too.” 5. How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? Chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI have dashboards that clearly identify what visitors are asking about in the destination. That helps inform content and product development strategy, and the data is valuable for community engagement. AI chat platforms also operate 24/7 in 50+ languages, which helps DMO influence in-destination travel and spending for a much wider audience than ever before. How to best capitalize on conversational AI, and ultimately conversational commerce, is an evolving topic because we’re still in the early days where travelers are learning they can search with large language models and trust them. ChatGPT has 400 million weekly users but ChatGPT only added full functioning search capability for all users a few months ago. Consumers are just beginning to understand that they can now “talk” to a city. To help accelerate understanding and adoption of AI chat among visitors, Port asserted that the onus is on DMOs to promote their AI chat robustly like any other channel. Weir did that recently by highlighting Destination Toronto’s GuideGeek-powered “6ix” chat platform on LinkedIn, asking, “Ever had a chat directly with a city?” Weir was specifically promoting the organization’s WhatsApp platform, where people can now have a highly personalized, iterative conversation directly with Destination Toronto via the GuideGeek AI integration. The same functionality exists with the other Meta platforms, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. A few hours after Weir's post I received a Slack message from our CTO Stefan Klopp wondering what was going on in Toronto. WhatsApp volume was spiking, he said, and he was asking if Toronto had sent out a press release promoting 6ix, or something. No, it was just a quick CEO social media post. Also, Tourism New Zealand just launched a new campaign in collaboration with “A Minecraft Movie” that integrates GuideGeek-powered prompt questions to trigger further engagement. So, those are just a couple examples of how DMO/NTOs can drive AI chat engagement. The question for Weir and Port though is about the types of questions people are asking in AI chat platforms. Presently, a lot of the chat conversations are more utilitarian, related to queries about hotels, restaurants, attractions, events, directions, etc. So as conversational AI adoption increases, will DMOs focus more on developing content that answers those basic types of questions, like what hotel, restaurant or attraction is highly rated, and how to get there. Or, should DMOs continue to focus mainly on developing what is generally perceived as more inspirational destination and experiential content? "The question then becomes about responding to inquiries versus the inspirational side," explained Port. "Like, all of these articles, all of this content that we serve up, that is not in response to a question per se. It's more packaged to inspire people. I think a lot of that's going to have to exist outside our environments, maybe, whether it's influencers, it's your earned media strategy, it's content partnerships, things like that. That's where I think the inspiration will exist. But we really have to move to being more of the informative one, on our website or whatever a website is. But it needs to be very specific in answering questions. We already see that on GuideGeek." Weir summed up, saying, "I think this ends up relating more to, again, that question of where the customers are. Are we putting ourselves in a position to answer their questions and deliver the information in the way they're looking for it, using AI and the data lake approach? Or, are we curators like we've always been, inspiring visitors with local experiences, or is the customer now the curator by virtue of how they're asking questions today?" Summary These five takeaways are aligned with the five big AI questions. AI adoption begins with talking to DMO staff to understand what the organization is working with. Love the idea about marrying structured and self-directed learning, and being intentional about that with staff. At some point, for AI adoption to scale and continually evolve on an ongoing basis, there needs to be AI leaders in any organization who pick up the torch and inspire their colleagues to lean into AI. Otherwise, things tend to plateau with the same people using the same AI models. AI policy is intended to encourage staff to innovate with AI as much as it's meant to protect organizations. AI is the death of "I don't know," so it can benefit all staff in all departments. That in itself is enough ROI to validate initial investments in AI. The tools can provide a foundation of knowledge and direction for problem solving and strategic planning exponentially better than traditional search. Some organizations, like Visit Greece who we work with, have phenomenal website data structure ideally optimized for AI search. Meanwhile, one CEO told me "Our website is a mess with outdated content and poor data structure. We need to rebuild from scratch with AI search top of mind." Chat is the new marketplace, and AI is eating the entire funnel including in-destination. Moreover, AI chat data provides DMO leaders with insights into what visitors are asking about. Although, I think as chat adoption scales mainstream, the conversations will evolve beyond asking for a good hotel or restaurant. Greg Oates

Why Small Steps With AI Create Big Wins for Tourism Organizations Sep 22 Written By Greg Oates Key Theme: How to Align Strategic Risk Management and Progressive AI Implementation The rush to transform everything with AI has dominated boardroom discussions since ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Yet the most successful organizations aren't pursuing wholesale AI overhauls. They're taking calculated, incremental steps that deliver real value while building capabilities for the future. MIT researchers interviewed senior managers at 21 large companies actively using generative AI. Their findings challenge the prevailing narrative about AI transformation. Companies are deliberately choosing "small t" transformations over risky, large-scale implementations. This approach works particularly well for tourism organizations where customer trust and regulatory compliance matter deeply. Tourism organizations face unique challenges with AI adoption. Customer data privacy concerns run high. Regulatory requirements vary across jurisdictions. Service quality directly impacts reputation. The research reveals that successful companies treat AI implementation like climbing a risk slope. They start with low-risk internal applications before moving to customer-facing solutions. This measured approach isn't about being timid. It's about being smart. Tourism CEOs can build organizational confidence, develop necessary skills, and demonstrate tangible value before tackling more complex implementations. Start With Universal Productivity Tools That Employees Already Want to Use The research uncovered a surprising reality. Employees were already using ChatGPT and other public AI tools without permission. Companies responded by providing secure, private versions of these tools. This grassroots adoption pattern offers tourism organizations a clear starting point. Consider how your marketing team writes destination descriptions. Your operations staff creates training materials. Your finance team prepares reports. These tasks consume hours of employee time across every department. Private AI instances from providers like ChatGPT or Claude eliminate security concerns while boosting productivity. McKinsey built a custom platform called Lilli that connects AI to 40 internal knowledge sources. The result? Seventy-five percent employee adoption in under a year. Time savings up to 30%. Substantially improved work quality. Tourism organizations don't need to build something this sophisticated initially. Even basic AI writing assistants can transform daily work. Microsoft Copilot integration takes this further. Employees can search across company documents instantly. They can pull content from emails, meeting transcripts, and presentations. One manager described it as having "a super search engine" for company information. Imagine your team finding that obscure policy document from three years ago in seconds rather than hours. The beauty of starting here? Minimal risk. Maximum adoption. Employees want these tools. They're probably already using consumer versions. Providing enterprise versions addresses security concerns while meeting existing demand. Your IT team maintains control. Your employees get productivity gains. Everyone wins. Some employees will still seek external tools for specific needs. One product manager uses Midjourney for quick visuals. Another uses voice-to-text tools for performance reviews. Accept this reality. Focus on providing core tools internally while establishing clear guidelines for external tool usage. Deploy AI for Specific Roles While Keeping Humans in Control Once basic AI tools gain traction, tourism organizations can target specific job functions. The key insight from the research? Maintain human oversight for quality control. This "human in the loop" approach reduces risk while capturing efficiency gains. Customer service represents an ideal starting point for tourism organizations. AI can help agents find information quickly. It can suggest responses in real time. It can analyze call patterns to identify coaching opportunities. MIT researchers found AI coaching tools increased call center productivity by 14% on average. New and low-skilled workers improved by 34%. Morgan Stanley equipped financial advisors with an AI assistant trained on over one million internal documents. The tool doesn't replace advisors. It helps them find information faster so they can focus on customer relationships. Tourism organizations can apply this same principle. Help your concierge staff access local recommendations instantly. Enable tour guides to answer obscure historical questions accurately. Support reservation agents with instant access to availability across properties. CarMax demonstrates another powerful application. The company uses AI to generate descriptions for over 5,000 car pages. Manual creation would take multiple humans 11 years. With AI, it takes hours. The 80% approval rate from editorial review proves quality doesn't suffer. Tourism organizations can apply this to property descriptions, tour summaries, and destination guides. Creative teams at Dentsu use AI throughout their workflow. From proposals to budgeting to ideation. The emerging technology director noted employees spend less time on mundane tasks. They create higher-quality content with less effort. Tourism marketing teams can similarly accelerate campaign development, social media content creation, and promotional material design. Finance departments traditionally resist new technology. Yet some organizations successfully use AI for audit reports, regulatory compliance, and fraud detection. Amazon's finance team reports employees shifted from repetitive tasks to critical thinking work. Tourism organizations can start with expense report processing or invoice matching before tackling complex financial analysis. Transform Customer Experiences Gradually With Clear Boundaries Customer-facing AI sits highest on the risk slope. Yet the potential rewards justify careful exploration. The research shows companies succeeding by setting clear boundaries and expanding gradually. Chatbots evolved from frustrating phone trees to sophisticated conversational agents. John Hancock's insurance chatbots handle common queries effectively. Human agents focus on complex issues. Starbucks, Domino's, and CVS expanded to voice interactions. Video interactions come next. Tourism organizations can start with FAQ chatbots on their websites. Add booking assistance once that works well. Expand to voice-based concierge services when ready. Personalization transforms online shopping experiences. Tapestry, parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, uses real-time language modifications. The conversational tone mimics in-store associates. Revenue increased at least 3%. Tourism organizations can personalize trip recommendations based on past bookings. Adjust website content for different traveler segments. Customize email campaigns for individual preferences. Software companies already embed AI throughout their products. Adobe users create and modify images effortlessly. Canva simplifies presentation creation. Lucidchart converts text descriptions into flowcharts. Tourism organizations benefit as their existing software vendors add AI features. Property management systems will suggest optimal pricing. Booking platforms will predict cancellation risks. Marketing tools will automate campaign optimization. The key? Start small. Test thoroughly. Expand gradually. A failed internal productivity tool frustrates employees. A failed customer-facing AI damages your brand. Move up the risk slope deliberately. Build Foundational Capabilities Before Attempting Major Transformations The research revealed an uncomfortable truth. Scaling AI from pilot to production is harder than expected. Data quality issues multiply. Edge cases appear more frequently. Integration challenges compound. Many organizations discovered they needed stronger foundations before pursuing ambitious AI projects. CarMax's chief information officer emphasized data quality. "Good data will give you good results from AI." Poor data produces unreliable outputs. Tourism organizations must audit their data systems. Customer records across multiple systems need reconciliation. Historical booking data requires cleaning. Property information needs standardization. Governance structures matter equally. Who approves AI projects? How do you measure success? What happens when AI makes mistakes? Establish these frameworks before scaling implementations. Small pilots can proceed without perfect governance. Enterprise deployments cannot. Capital One's chief scientist warned against the "gold-rush mentality." Thoughtful, responsible implementation beats rushed deployment. Build the scaffolding to bring everyone along. Tourism organizations should resist pressure to match competitors' AI announcements. Focus on sustainable progress over headlines. Management buy-in proves essential for larger projects. One technology company's AI efforts stagnated until the CEO personally championed them. Small wins build credibility for bigger investments. Document productivity gains from initial deployments. Share customer satisfaction improvements. Make the business case concrete before requesting major funding. Summary: Small Transformations Today Enable Big Transformations Tomorrow The research delivers a clear message for tourism CEOs. Successful AI implementation doesn't require revolutionary change. It requires evolutionary progress. Start with universal productivity tools that employees already want. Target specific roles with human oversight. Transform customer experiences within careful boundaries. Build foundational capabilities systematically. This approach particularly suits tourism organizations. Your business depends on human connections. Technology should enhance these connections, not replace them. Your customers value authentic experiences. AI should enable better experiences, not artificial ones. Your reputation takes years to build and moments to destroy. Measured AI deployment protects what you've built while enabling future growth. The companies studied aren't waiting for perfect AI solutions. They're using today's technology to solve real problems while preparing for tomorrow's possibilities. They're training employees, cleaning data, and establishing governance. When breakthrough AI capabilities arrive, they'll be ready to capitalize quickly. Tourism organizations can follow this same path. Deploy AI writing assistants next month. Add customer service chatbots next quarter. Enhance personalization next year. Each step builds on the last. Each success enables the next. Small transformations compound into competitive advantage. The AI transformation race isn't won by the fastest starter. It's won by consistent, strategic progress. Tourism CEOs who embrace "small t" transformation today position their organizations for "big T" transformation tomorrow. The journey starts with a single step up the risk slope. Greg Oates

How to Develop AI Strategy for Your Organization Oct 12 Written By Greg Oates The 2050 City AI Roadmap provides a high-level strategic framework for how DMOs and other organizations can capitalize on AI to optimize internal operations, resources and knowledge, and ultimately, drive partner revenue. DMOs have all kinds of strategic plans, master plans, business and marketing plans, etc. The 2050 City AI Roadmap outlines the process to develop your AI strategic plan. It defines the big picture outlook for AI as the future of commerce, and it proposes a methodology to help DMO leaders prioritize, organize and navigate how they go about integrating AI across their organization. Presently, we're rolling this out with Visit Mesa , Tourism Richmond in British Columbia, and The Florida Keys & Key West . The three CEOs for those organizations have all agreed to share takeaways and business outcomes with each others' teams to cross-pollinate learning and accelerate AI process integration. That spirit of knowledge sharing and co-learning for me is huge, because we as an industry are all pretty much flying blindly with AI from a macro perspective. Yes, we've come a long way in the last year. Every DMO CEO I talk to these days is now implementing various AI processes and seeing value. However, we're all kind of flying this plane while we're building it at the same time, and we don't really have a destination, or even due north, in mind. The 2050 City AI Roadmap was designed to identify where we're going with this emergent technology that's both incredibly powerful and often highly unpredictable. It also defines how high-end AI chat platforms, like Matador Network's GuideGeek AI , are the tip of the spear for agentic commerce. The following guidelines are based on experience in the workplace to deliver new value with AI for your team, board, industry partners and community stakeholders. Internal & External Direction Every decision related to AI strategy should first be defined through an internal or external lens. Your board members will typically view internal workplace optimization as tactical. Externally, AI integrations that are consumer-facing and revenue generating are usually perceived as more strategic. Internal Facing From an internal standpoint, the focus of the AI Roadmap is on optimizing operations to take advantage of an organization's aggregate of resources and knowledge. Imagine the totality of insights across every team member in terms of their expertise and networks in their communities. AI systems are designed to pool and capitalize on that, but only if an organization's knowledge base is structured intelligently. That means rebuilding your folder structures and files naming conventions so an AI can find everything. According to Slack, workers spend 41% of their time on menial tasks, including endless hours just looking for information. The overall losses related to productivity, quality of work and workplace, and physical/mental health are crazy. So let's start there with AI strategy to address our internal digital dumpster fire. External Facing Externally, from a marketing, sales and visitor/partner engagement perspective, AI strategy begins with integrating a robust AI chat platform like GuideGeek. DMOs have never really had proprietary information on who their visitors are. They have geo-location, credit card spend, event attendance data, etc., which show visitor behavior. But none of those really identify visitor motivations and mindsets indepth. With an AI chat platform, DMOs can now pull analytics showing what visitors are actually asking and what they want to know on an individual and aggregate basis. We launched our new GuideGeek V2 analytics dashboard this past week, which provides deeper, fuller insights into visitor psychographics. That data then informs all kinds of resource allocation decisions related to content development, AI SEO strategy, data analysis, product and destination development, community engagement, etc. CEO Roles AI is best defined as a new digital "co-intelligence" that can communicate, reason and create for the first time ever, versus just another new technology. We emphasize that AI is really a new environment for collaboration more than anything, just not solely among humans anymore. Learning AI is not like learning Photoshop. You can only "teach" AI up to a point, like trying to teach someone how to ride a bike. You can't teach a child how to stay on two wheels without falling in a classroom. He or she actually has to start pedaling, and eventually the child's mind and body basically have a conversation, so to speak, with the bike to grasp the fundamentals of moving forward successfully. Same with AI. The only way to learn AI is to use AI. Helping human teams embrace this new co-intelligence (and it's not like there's a choice) falls under the umbrella of change management. That's a CEO's wheelhouse. It will take more than a few years for many humans to reconcile their minds and values with this new relationship, and it falls on the CEO's shoulders to steward that reconciliation. Likewise, CEOs oversee AI governance, policy and privacy. I've shared before how AI governance should be viewed less like a car brake and more like a steering wheel to inform, direct and accelerate AI adoption and integration. Lastly, only CEOs can scale long-term AI benefits and business outcomes effectively. You can't really delegate this. AI efforts will plateau at times, some or many AI experimentations will fail, and there are always staff members who will drag their feet because they just don't like AI. DMO CEOs are chief people officers and it's on them to create the right culture for scaling AI platforms and processes effectively for everyone in their crews. Agentic AI This is where things get interesting. AI agents and agentic commerce might sound super confusing for many or most staff members. Lots of land mines to watch out for, sure, but even more reasons for us building a macro DMO AI strategic framework. One of the key objectives for the AI Roadmap is to elevate AI agents and agentic commerce as the two interrelated cornerstones for AI strategy, and explain why. Doing so shows the true big picture value of AI, and it drives home how we eventually need to move way beyond training people the basics of prompting. Yes, it's intimidating, but we introduce the labels and contexts relating to agentic AI early on in the process. That gets some people thinking bigger about AI, and it entices the AI champions in the group to start experimenting with agents. AI Agents (Internal) For internal AI strategy, leading DMOs are developing AI agents and automated workflows to address the aforementioned 41% of time that staff members spend on grunt work and trying to find information. They are proven, they work, and most of all, they deliver measurable ROI. We're working with outside contractors at Matador to develop and implement agents and automations for both ourselves internally and for DMO clients. We are already seeing success, and there's been a recent influx among our people asking for agents. It's an amazing thing to see when staff members start requesting new AI integrations like that, proactively. That's when you know your AI strategy is working at least on some level. Agentic Commerce (External) AI agents are also the foundation for agentic commerce. According to Mastercard , "Agentic commerce is a new form of online and mobile shopping, in which an AI agent 'closes the loop' or completes tasks for a user — such as searching for items, comparing options and making a purchase — with limited or no manual inputs needed from that user. For example, while chatting in a generative AI app, you could tell the AI agent, 'Book me a nonstop flight to London for under $600 next week — no red-eyes,' and the agent will review airlines, nearby airports and your loyalty memberships and payment card rewards to identify the best option, purchase it and then share it with you." Just like with AI agents, developing agentic commerce architecture covers a wide spectrum of sophistication and capabilities. Going back to the analogy of flying a plane while building it with no clear final destination in mind, agentic commerce is the point on the map where we want to land. With GuideGeek, we have Kayak, GetYourGuide, Skyscanner and other booking tools integrated into the platform with a click-through UX/UI. Looking ahead, we're working with one national tourism organization to bring some of their national partners' booking engines (air, hotel, tour op, etc.,) into the platform to eventually convert sales in-chat. Subscribe to Mastercard Signals to keep up-to-date on agentic commerce and access intelligence like this Mastercard Payments Trends Navigator report. Staff Training & AI Integration Training staff and implementing AI processes across all departments is really the meat of the 2050 City Roadmap. But none of that should proceed without DMO leadership embracing all the above, and communicating it clearly to all staff. Easier said than done, though. Leadership needs to continually communicate a high-level approach to AI strategy, because it won't really click for many staff (or leadership) at the beginning of this process. That, of course, needs to be married with all the practical training initiatives we're continuing to develop. We've already learned a ton with the present work we're doing training DMO teams. Here are a few very basic takeaways just to start explaining our process. There are obviously many more educational modules following these, ranging from predictive analytics to specific department AI training in areas like HR, finance and legal. Conduct an internal AI survey asking all staff to share their perceptions and usage of AI. Follow that up with small group interviews across the organization, and transcribe everything with an AI notetaker. We use Granola, but there are many others. Also, explain to staff that all meetings regarding AI will be recorded to create an internal knowledge base to identify opportunities, challenges and takeaways over time. Start training with a focus on just the paid/pro models of ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. Some staff feel confused with the sheer variety of available AI tools in front of them. We explain that, at the end of the day, the basics of using AI include an end user, an AI tool, and a knowledge base. Get people on board with that, and then show how most of the AI tools they have access to are similar in many ways. One of the fastest methods to advance AI understanding is showing staff how to create custom GPTs in ChatGPT. Some team members will pick up on these quickly and start integrating them into their workflows right away. These are the people who typically make up your internal AI taskforce. Explain and show how Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot are AI workhorses that connect with the majority of people's daily workflows. However, humans tend to think of those as just the next evolution of search engines. This is mental wiring that needs to be broken. Gemini and Copilot are great/good in some ways, but I've found that training staff on just those three native LLMs first (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) is more effective for seeing the light. Google NotebookLM has a lot of fans. I like to walk teams through it because it's a good way to reinforce what a knowledge base is, like we do with the custom GPTs. Also, the automated audio and video podcasts are crowd pleasers, especially with the new Join function where users can engage directly with the agentic podcast hosts. People don't seem to want to read anymore. This was a rude awakening for us when we first launched the AI Roadmap with a series of online training materials. We now know we need to deliver short video instruction if we want anyone to actually look at the educational content. People love Descript for AI-powered video creation. Once we started showing how to use Descript, we were pleasantly surprised to see how staff really leaned in. Teaching Descript provides a fun break early in the process because people can see pretty amazing results in minutes and wrap their minds around the process fairly easily. Ask all staff to share how they're using AI effectively and where they see AI failing them. Catalogue the case studies and share across the organization to accelerate learning, inspire a healthy sense of internal competition, and track learning over time. Staff members are also often wowed seeing AI agents in action. We use n8n to develop agents, where you can create a lot of basic automated workflows quickly. Once a few early adopters see how agents can take over some of their more tedious, time-consuming tasks, others will jump in. Feedback Loop & Funding/Board Support This line in the AI Roadmap is broken down into tactical internal optimization and more strategic, consumer-facing and revenue-generating sales, marketing and stakeholder engagement. I don't have a lot to share for this section and the following one because our focus to date has been mostly on the above phases. Feedback Loop The reason we record every engagement with AI Roadmap clients is to scale learning, so if one person learns something, everyone can benefit. That will be further multiplied when we starting sharing takeaways across DMOS, and eventually the industry as a whole. Visit Mesa, Tourism Richmond and Visit Florida Keys are eager to lead this initiative, and we plan to launch a new AI thought leadership framework collectively in 2026. Funding & Board Support The spark that led to developing the AI Roadmap happened almost a year ago when a board member for a large DMO told me that she viewed AI integration as merely a tactic. If this work can elevate AI in the minds of board members toward a more high-level strategic imperative, then we'll have achieved part of our mission. There's still some work to be done first though to collect more case studies showing direct AI business outcomes before we can make a more solid case for additional funding for AI integrations. AI Strategic Plan We've produced a mockup of what we think an AI Strategic Plan will eventually look like, but it's too early to show presently. For now, we've identified three overarching pillars, each with potential strategies, action items, timelines and targets. The KPIs are crucial, of course, for scaling AI strategy across the travel industry. Right now, we're thinking the three pillars might look like the following, although this is all up in the air right now: Optimize Internal Operations & Knowledge: The strategies include cleaning up internal folders/files to improve AI outcomes in general and develop AI agents specifically. A lot in here on training, experimentation, overall adoption, success measures, etc. Increase Partner Revenue with Agentic AI: Defining how DMOs develop AI agents to fuel agentic commerce is the big goal overall with the AI Roadmap. Initial strategies in this pillar begin with more low hanging fruit though, such as website redevelopment, optimizing for AI SEO, AI chat integration, etc. Expand Community Collaboration: We're seeing more DMOs take a leading role in AI education for their industry and community stakeholders. The 2050 City Roadmap is perfectly suited for informing how DMO leaders can facilitate community AI workshops and increase the organization's overall relevance and value. Greg Oates

Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Kara Franker , president and CEO of The Florida Keys & Key West tourism organization, was among the first DMO leaders to embrace AI platforms and processes in 2023 when she was chief executive at Visit Estes Park in Colorado. In May 2024, Franker published two papers on AI strategy and policy: From the Base of the Rocky Mountains to the World: A case study through Visit Estes Park’s journey into Generative AI solutions — and how your DMO can carve its own AI path Navigating AI and the Law in the Travel Industry: An Introduction to Legal Implications for DMOs The first paper highlights how Visit Estes Park integrated GuideGeek AI chat into their website and three Meta platforms: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The DMO also branded the chat Rocky Mountain Roamer to give it an identity and bit of personality. The second paper focused on AI policy and data privacy, security and compliance. Franker, who is an attorney, co-wrote that with Roxanne Steinhoff , also an attorney at Steinhoff Law, who leads the firm’s destination marketing and sports tourism practice. I caught up with Franker to see how her perspectives on AI strategy and policy are evolving almost a year later. Greg Oates: You've been leading AI strategy in tourism for almost two years beginning with your work at Visit Estes Park. However, there’s still a lack of AI training today specific for DMO CEOs, and many leaders are presently unsure how to proceed with AI. As a CEO, what’s your take on that? Kara Franker: I'm not surprised that there's a lack of training because there's just so much for everybody to wrap their heads around. I think some people are trying to watch and wait and see. My philosophy has been more of a fall-forward, fail-forward kind of approach. That's why I put the white papers out. Anybody could learn from what we had done, and do it better. You know, a case study is sometimes the best way to figure this stuff out, so that's why we did it. The second paper on AI policy was with Roxanne Steinhoff on the legal and ethical implications of AI. Because when I would go and speak in front of groups, those were always the big questions from the leadership. They don't know how far is too far once you open this can of worms. That's why we got together and started to put guardrails in place that we thought might make sense for people to study, just as a first stab at it. That all launched last summer, so I do think that there's a little bit of education out there but we could definitely use more. GO: What do DMOs need to know about AI policy at a very high level in terms of privacy and security? KF: Employee and client information should be kept private and not uploaded into any AI tools. That could be a big deal, thinking of all the different rules and regulations about collecting information, especially how it's more stringent in Europe than in the United States. That can cause potential problems if you're uploading, say, a client list that has personal cell phones, email addresses or other information that people just don't want out there. So, it's really more about information that's attached to a person. And then, is there competitive data that you don't necessarily want others to have? Possibly, but so much of what we do in the DMO space is public anyways so the lines for that are pretty blurry. I’m trying to imagine a scenario where a DMO is, like, basically hacking somebody else's information through AI. I can’t imagine that’s worth the time and effort, or even possible. GO: A few months ago we were discussing what AI tools might be available for DMO departments like HR and accounting to help with privacy, compliance, efficiency, etc. But everything available seems to be enterprise grade and out of reach for DMOs. So what’s the answer for scaling AI across an organization? KF: I think this is a huge need. I hired somebody from Cisco who’s my new VP of technology and partnerships. She's a total AI nerd like I am, and way more qualified to dive into all this. She and I have been looking at different options to put together, almost like little plugins. We really, really need this. For example, how do we take an AI solution from the legal world to analyze all our contracts so that we don't have to spend as many hours with attorneys, because we really just need a template, right? And then for HR, same thing. How do we organize all our employee files into a much more streamlined and effective system? And then there’s our policies. We're a nonprofit but everything we do is so heavily influenced by County government. We have so many compliance issues, so I want an AI to learn every single piece of County policies so we’re able to compare and contrast what we're doing with those policies. I haven't been able to find anything to help with these things. We've looked at a lot of different options but it's like what you're saying. They're these big enterprise pieces built for law firms or financial people, and they’re all really expensive. None of them fit the mold for improving different operations at a DMO. In my mind, the marketing side is covered, especially with GuideGeek, and there are so many great options now for everything involved with marketing. So I feel like that's been tackled and done really well. But for the operations, we need more. I mean, we’ve just got to keep digging deeper, I think. GO: When you and your technology person from Cisco figure all this out, will you share what you find with the rest of us? KF: Of course, always. GO: Backing up a bit, you were arguably the very first DMO CEO to lean into AI, at least in North America, when you were with Visit Estes Park. How did you convince your board that investing in AI was important at the time, and what were some of your processes with bringing along staff? KF: We were fortunate in the sense that the board was all in and the staff were all in. And I don't mean to make age a part of it, but the staff was a little on the young side and they were all very ambitious. Everybody wanted to try to figure it out. So we made the argument to the board, if we could figure out some of what AI could do, it would make the community stronger and they could take pieces of it back to their businesses. There wasn't really anybody who was against experimenting and trying it out. We made some mistakes along the way and we put that in the white paper. Also, when we first rolled out GuideGeek, which scrapes the website, we found a few holes in our content. There were particular board members who didn't have very robust information about their business, so they got a little bit mad, but not in a, like, burn it down way. It was more of, "Oh, okay, we have some work to do." So part of the AI process has to actually be community outreach. It can't just be about the technology. We have to talk to all our partners and get really robust information from them, so when the AI crawls the site it gets the best possible information about our partners. GO: One thing you did at Visit Estes Park was brand your GuideGeek AI as Rocky Mountain Roamer on your website and three Meta platforms. We use that as a case study a lot, and emphasize that a DMO should promote their AI just like any other channel, right? KF: Definitely. We knew we had to put money behind marketing the tool if we wanted people to interact with it. Traditionally with a DMO, one of your calls to action is to send people to the website. Our new call to action for a lot of our campaigns back then was to send people to the AI, so we called it Rocky Mountain Roamer to help promote and drive traffic to it. And then in terms of KPIs, we wanted to track all the interactions you can see in the backend, but not just how many people used it. We wanted to know how long people interacted with the AI, what their journey was, and what they were asking about because that’s where things get really interesting. GO: After the initial thrill of launching GuideGeek, how did you manage how staff used AI internally? Were there any incentives involved to help spur adoption and experimentation? KF: The incentive for my team was, well, it wasn't really an incentive. It was a requirement. They had to write weekly reports for me about how they tested something with AI, whatever it was. It could apply to their job or not, I didn't really care. So I almost forced them to try AI. But then people started really getting into it. They were getting more and more user friendly with different AI tools, and they would be like, “Oh, I like Anthropic because of this or that,” because they were branching out from just using ChatGPT. So, yeah, there has to be almost like a culture of AI in your DMO for it to really work, and it's on the CEO to create and foster that. Greg Oates

Join Matador Network's AI Playground at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Matador Network, GuideGeek AI and U.S. Travel are launching the inaugural "AI Playground" at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix, August 17-19. The educational space, hands-on demo area, genius bar and live sessions will run all three days during the conference. We are also producing programming specific for travel industry CEOs, along with other sessions dedicated for senior executives, highlighting actionable AI strategies focusing on real world business outcomes. Leading up to ESTO, I'll be reaching out to many of you requesting any AI-related success stories and/or questions you might have for the AI Playground. Looking back over the last two years, it's clear the industry is turning a corner in 2025 when it comes to AI learning and adoption. Many DMOs and their industry partners are now integrating AI processes and platforms across their organizations, whereas last year many destination leaders were still in wait-and-see mode. For those of you still on the fringes, it is our ambition that the AI Playground will plant a flag in the ground showing how AI is now a proven strategy for helping DMOs further deliver on their mandate. "AI is clearly powering the future of travel and how people explore the world today," says Ross Borden, founder and CEO of Matador Network. "We are stoked to be working with U.S. Travel and investing in our industry to produce the AI Playground. AI will become standard operating procedure for every DMO soon, and we're excited to help lead this journey." DMO CEOs on AI Strategy Matador launched its proprietary GuideGeek AI chat platform for DMO websites and social media channels almost two years ago. We now have more than 40 DMOs onboard, and we're expanding the scope of GuideGeek AI with new hotel groups and tour operators joing in recent months. Based on our experience working with municipal, regional and national organizations across the global visitor industry, we have unparalleled insights into how conversational AI is changing the relationship between destinations and visitors, as well as how DMOs operate internally. In preparation for ESTO 2025, we launched this GuideGeek Destination AI newsletter in January to ramp up our industry outreach and further expand our understanding of how DMO leaders are navigating the rise of AI. Here are five stories from the newsletter that inform high-level decision making related to AI strategy, with input from more than 15 CEO DMOs: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI : Our first post with 12 DMO CEOs highlighted the wide range of questions they have. One asked for the five big AI questions he should know about. Another wants practical advice on five AI initiatives that he can implement, like, tomorrow. Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism : CEO Royce Chwin, who helms Destination Vancouver, shared why his organization was one of the first DMOs in the world to dive into AI. Destination Toronto & Visit Denver CEOs on the 5 Big AI Questions in Tourism : Two chief executives, Andrew Weir in Toronto and Richard Scharf in Denver, worked out what they believe are the five big AI themes/questions that DMOs need to focus on, as touched on in the first post. Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation : Newly installed Florida Keys CEO Kara Franker, who is also an attorney, shed light on AI policy, compliance and the need for more non-enterprise AI solutions for her organization. Visit Mesa CEO Launches New DMO AI Road Map : Another visionary DMO chief executive, Visit Mesa leader Marc Garcia is bringing a new level of structure and direction for integrating AI processes and platforms. Next up, Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau, will be discussing AI strategy from a business events perspective. I also met with Cody Chomiak, vice president of marketing at Travel Manitoba, who's really lighting a fire in Canada around AI thought leadership and adoption. He'll be sharing a few powerful AI case studies from his provincial marketing organization, both internal and visitor-facing. AI Playground at ESTO 2025 The AI Playground this year will feature three stations at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge . We will have our Matador GuideGeek team and U.S. Travel staff on hand to guide participants through the space, along with some invited AI experts from around the industry. We'll be digging into a handful of paid AI models including ChatGPT Plus/Teams, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro, Google AI Pro, Microsoft Copilot Pro and Manus. We'll show how AI is best navigated at DMOs by bucketing strategy into three unique categories: Search, Create and Sales. Specific use cases will include content generation and data analysis, AI SEO and AI-optimized web development, AI policy and governance, staff adoption, building custom GPTs for sales proposals, and automated workflows and AI agents, among others. The three stations are: The Prompt Lab welcomes all attendees to come in and test drive various AI models. The interactive, hands-on learning station will have multiple laptops for experimenting with AI tools for people of all skill levels. We'll have a bunch of paid AI models pre-loaded for live demos and one-on-one conversations showing how AI actually works and some of what it accomplishes across different departments. Feel free to bring your own laptop if you like. The Genius Bar is designed for individual and group Q&A about real world AI strategy, implementation and ROI. We'll be collecting all the questions posed to share with the broader industry afterward, so we'll have a couple crowdsourcing boards to help generate new ideas and explore new solutions. Reach out to me if you want to schedule time to talk during ESTO. The AI Theater seating area will host a range of AI-focused dialogues, micro-presentations and a few dedicated sessions designed for CEOs, as well as other senior executives. The programming schedule for all those will engagements be included in the ESTO agenda. Most importantly, all the conversations at the AI Playground will highlight tangible AI case studies and specific business outcomes. The 5 Big Questions About AI One of the best things to come out of all the interviews with DMO CEOs this year is our list of the five big AI questions that chief executives need to focus on. These questions will likely evolve a bit, but for now they're providing direction for how we're developing the AI Playground and how DMOs are moving forward with AI integration. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? I would love to hear your feedback on any the above and how we can make the ESTO 2025 AI Playground as valuable as possible for you and your teams. Reach out at greg@matadornetwork.com . Greg Oates

Visit Mesa CEO Launches New AI Roadmap Aug 25 Written By Greg Oates Visit Mesa in Arizona kicked off a new internal initiative this week to integrate AI processes and platforms across the organization. I worked with Visit Mesa to help develop their new DMO AI Roadmap, which provides a 5-phase strategic framework that most any visitor organization can use as a template. The project officially began this week during Visit Mesa’s spring board meeting to communicate why the organization is moving forward with AI to optimize the DMO’s value for Mesa’s visitor industry and the local community. Marc Garcia, CATP , president and CEO of Visit Mesa, has been eager to start this initiative. He was one of the dozen CEOs who contributed to the first GuideGeek Destination AI story a few months back, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI. For that deep dive into a CEO's mindset regarding AI, Garcia asked: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” The Visit Mesa DMO AI Roadmap answers those questions. “I've recognized that AI is extremely important not only for the world moving forward, but specifically for our industry,” Garcia explained at the beginning of this project. “We at Visit Mesa need to get out in front of it. Even as a small to medium-sized DMO with our budget, we've always taken pride in the fact that we’re typically at the forefront of the latest and greatest in terms of technology, and so this is just an extension of that.” The following is a high-level overview of the DMO AI Roadmap and each of the five phases. However, like all strategic planning, there is a big jump between developing a plan and executing it effectively. This is especially true with internal AI training. In any given organization today, there is often a wide breadth of how people perceive AI and how proficient they are with AI models. It will take time to educate and align everyone around shared benefits for the organizations and staff, expected processes, intended outcomes and success metrics. Visit Mesa AI Roadmap The DMO AI Roadmap is a structured, phased approach for educating staff and integrating AI across DMO departments. The goals for the roadmap are to optimize internal operations, enhance sales and marketing outcomes, inspire staff self-learning, future-proof the organization, and contribute to how well local industry and community leaders adopt AI best practices and benefit from them. There are two imperatives that should be established and agreed upon among leadership at the very beginning. Integrating AI processes and platforms is an imperative for the DMO to ensure its relevancy and long-term impact in the local visitor economy. If leadership doesn’t fully believe that, this strategic framework won’t work. AI proficiency is an imperative for staff members for their future growth and marketability. That said, you can’t really force people to embrace, learn and use AI intentionally, but the job market will. The following phases are highly fluid and some of the processes can be rolled out concurrently. Ultimately, these phases provide structure for effectively and responsibly implementing a new technology that has no precedent. Because of generative AI, machines can now do three things they haven’t been able to do before. They have the ability to reason, the ability to communicate, and the ability to generate stuff based on that reasoning and communication. Meaning, AI is messy. Integrating it into our daily workflows is also messy because it's challenging us to rethink our relationship with technology. But as Kate Yordi, director of marketing at Visit Mesa, said during the board meeting this week, “Finally, we have some direction.” Phase 1: Leadership Alignment & Staff Communication As discussed at length in previous Destination AI posts, the DMO CEO must make it clear to all staff that the organization prioritizes AI because the organization prioritizes being relevant. It certainly helps, as is the case with Visit Mesa, when the CEO is fully backed by the board to invest in AI integration. During the board meeting, one member asked, “What do you need from us, Marc?” That’s a good sign. For the DMO AI Roadmap to work, all leadership needs to not only have a basic understanding of AI tools, they need to actually use them as well on a regular basis. That goes a long way in driving agency across the organization. However, making that happen typically requires some C-suite training to explain the primary AI models more indepth: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot and/or Google Gemini depending on the specific workplace platform(s) the organization uses. Identifying and prioritizing just a handful of AI models like that brings a lot of clarity to the process right off the bat. You see people's shoulders relax when they're confronted with 5-6 AIs versus dozens. (Yes, VEED, Gamma, Manus, Sora, Granola, Slack AI, etc., are all really cool but let's not start there.) A common lament among DMO leadership related to AI is, “Where do we even start?” Leadership should then discuss and begin to answer the five big questions all CEOs face when navigating AI integration, as vetted in the aforementioned Destination AI post about what CEOs want regarding AI education: How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI (who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI) to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and quality of work? How do we redevelop our content and channels to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI for business purposes to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The next step in this phase, at a basic level, is communicating to staff why they’re being asked to embrace AI. The following is not meant to be comprehensive, but a CEO would likely want to articulate: The purpose of the AI Roadmap, guiding principles, and the phases and processes involved How AI integration will take time and people will evolve at different paces It’s ok if everyone feels like they’re building the plane while flying it Everyone is encouraged to use AI and will be supported, but there will also be guardrails in place AI adoption and use cases will become part of employee reviews, but traditional roles, responsibilities and key success metrics are still the priority "How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents." — Marc Garcia, president and CEO, Visit Mesa Phase 2: Staff Assessment & AI Task Force Sitting down and asking staff how they feel about AI and how/if they’re using it is a good way to begin. Depending on the size of the organization, this can be done with every staff member individually or a representative group from each department. Generally people fall into three camps when it comes to AI: 1) Those who are already using AI on a regular basis; 2) those who are curious and have experimented a bit, but they don’t actively engage with AI tools; and 3) those who don’t see much value in AI. This last group can also include people who outright oppose AI, but they make themselves apparent pretty quickly. Data also shows there is often a significant percentage of staff who use AI in secret because they’re not sure they’re allowed to use it for work purposes. The second way to collect staff sentiment and AI capacity is with a blind online survey asking everyone what they like about AI, what concerns them, how they feel about job security, what they want to learn, what they hope to achieve, etc. Everything is anonymous so you can expect a wide variety of feedback ranging from constructive/optimistic to fears of an impending robot apocalypse. Once complete, all the data should be synthesized into key takeaways for leadership and shared with staff to show a high level of transparency right from the beginning of this process. The second part of this phase is developing an AI task force. The value of this cannot be overemphasized. Choose a small group of AI champions from various departments to do three things: Provide direction for stewarding the various processes in each phase as effectively as possible from beginning to end Share constructive and thoughtful input they’re hearing from other staff members about how things are proceeding well and where there are challenges Help scale AI adoption across teams by showing how they’re using AI effectively to everyone else in the organization An internal AI task force or council is invaluable because the members are motivated and they want to learn. Mostly, their enthusiasm and success with AI will begin to rub off on many of their colleagues and inspire self-learning and greater adoption among the teams. But not all. There will be those who disengage, and there can be a significant number of them. Over time, they should be consulted to understand their trepidation, which should then be addressed. This is a challenge I'm having with one organization where a significant cohort are saying they're too busy to learn AI. Meanwhile, the majority of the staff are reporting daily usage with effective results, which definitely wasn't the case a few months ago. And even with those leaning in, the level of improvement and AI Iearning will be slow at times. This is why it’s critical for the CEO and the rest of management to be all-in and consistently participate in staff training sessions to show direction, intention and support. It’s very easy for the novelty of AI training to wear off after the first few months. This is where the AI task force can be instrumental to help maintain overall staff interest and keep engagement levels as high as possible. "Finally, we have some direction." — Kate Yordi, director of marketing, Visit Mesa Phase 3: AI Policy & Investments Developing an official AI policy and governance manual accomplishes two primary objectives: It protects the organization against legal and financial liability by establishing how all employees are required to use AI responsibly. It encourages and gives license for staff to proactively experiment with AI because there are clear guidelines in place about how to do so. There are many DMOs who have created AI policies and are willing to share with the rest of the industry. These are typically not lengthy documents (3-4 pages) nor full of legalese. Generally they’re written so every single employee can understand everything in them. Sections in these policies often include: Positioning/Purpose Statement: Expresses how and why the organization needs to be intentional about implementing AI processes Primary Objectives and Intended Outcomes: Defines the business case for how the organization is attempting to deliver on its core mandate of driving revenue to local businesses in alignment with community priorities Guiding Principles: Establishes the principles of responsible AI use in alignment with the values of the organizations related to themes such as inclusivity, bias, authenticity, veracity, collaboration, knowledge sharing, etc. AI Definitions: Provides clear explanations of AI terminology used in the document and workplace AI Tools: Identifies specific AI models that the organization provides access to Data Input: Dictates clear rules about what employees can upload into AI models and what they can’t upload, such as personal information of any person Monitoring: Defines how the organization reserves the right to monitor AI practices Training & Support: Defines opportunities for professional growth and learning AI on an ongoing basis There are other items that DMOs might include in the above list, and they vary depending on how HR, financial and legal departments interpret AI governance, but it serves as a foundation. One key consideration for DMO leadership when it comes to policy is identifying which pro AI models to invest in. Paid AI tools provide higher levels of privacy and security because AI companies don’t train on them, or at least there’s the choice to select that option. Many DMOs, for example, purchase annual subscriptions for paid ChatGPT Team accounts ($25 per employee monthly) for staff to use for work, which is a first step for protecting the IP and other interests of the organization. Other paid AI models are then provided to specific departments based on need and the specific attributes of the tools, such as Claude for marketing and social media staff because many consider it the best AI for content creation. Phase 4: AI Education & Implementation This is the most important thing in training teams to embrace and use AI effectively. You want to foster an environment where structured learning evolves into self-learning. That’s the only way this scales. When staff members with little experience in AI start exploring how to use AI on their own, and they start helping their colleagues see new ways to use AI, that’s a pretty special thing. From an education standpoint, the DMO AI Roadmap begins at a high level defining AI’s place in online history. AI is the third transformational shift since the PC was invented, including: The mainstream web/internet in the 1990s; the evolution of mobile/social/cloud and apps in the 2000s; and gen AI in the 2020s. These are the only three times when big tech went all-in and pivoted their business models around a new technology. I then break AI training into the following buckets, and again, this is all very surface level and not meant to be comprehensive. Also, creating engaging demos are everything, and that's not also easy because AI demos can be a real slog sometimes. But, showing how different AIs provide real value is key for people to internalize their learning and use it more intuitively over time: Explain how pre-gen AI tech is deterministic and gen AI is probabilistic, which messes with a lot of people’s minds. Gen AI outputs are based on statistical patterns and probabilities, just like the human brain processes ideas and information. Traditional tech is based on absolutes, delivering the same output based on the same input. Old tech is about information. AI is about knowledge. Spend a lot of time on this with workshops and demos. Highlight the capabilities of only three AI models to start: ChatGPT for brainstorming and planning; Claude for writing and data analysis; and Perplexity for conversational search. The other two, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, are more general purpose. They also do amazing things (Gemini 2.5 Pro is great for reasoning), but focusing on the first three will provide direction at the beginning so people don’t get overwhelmed. At the very minimum, leadership should have a basic understanding of those three. Explain how AI search isn't 100% perfect but it's a 1,000% better than old search. Define how DMOs and all brnads are redesigning their websites and content strategy to optimize for AI search, and the basics of AI SEO . I would argue the most important thing for using AI is really understanding how generative AI = conversational AI. It's a dialogue. It's called "chat" for a reason. This is where I’ve heard the most positive feedback from teams I’ve worked with. It happens when people move beyond the Google mindset—where search is one and done—and they see the real value of iterative conversations with AI models that evolve with each exchange in the discussion, just like a human conversation. This also removes some misperceptions about how to prompt. Yes, there are some basic rules about how to prompt well. But beyond that, it’s vastly more beneficial to explore AI conversations further with thoughtful follow-up prompts that flow logically and organically to achieve the best results. Explore how the real value of AI extends beyond just efficiency and productivity gains. That's a dangerous dialogue with staff who can construe that as leading to more work or being terminated over time. The bigger value and better narrative is how AI increases creativity and knowledge, and how those both influence overall quality of work, marketing effectiveness, sales productivity, staff culture and pride, job satisfaction and growth opportunities, etc. Really dig into the advanced features of the paid models: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro. Aside from the added security and privacy they provide, they offer functions not available in the free models and their outputs are significantly better. ChatGPT Projects and custom GPTs, Claude Projects and Perplexity Spaces are where the magic happens. Create an environment where staff members are eager to share their successes with AI with the rest of the organization. This feedback loop is critical for steering education and driving adoption, and it’s one of the most important roles for the internal AI task force. AI-training meetings can be highly effective during video calls but they often have the greatest impact during in-person workshops. Also, make sure to give staff a specific amount of hours during the week to develop their AI skills. Explore options for AI chat platforms and the benefits they provide for visitors and local industry partners. I work with Matador Network, which developed the industry leading GuideGeek AI chat platform. The feedback from 35+ DMO clients is impressive and irrefutable, but there is still much work to do educating visitors and industry about AI chat strategy and their benefits to continually increase adoption and business outcomes. The DMO AI Roadmap also provides guidance for developing various learning and engagement formats: Schedule weekly or bi-weekly meetings specifically, and only, for AI training with both internal and external people sharing insights Create a library of AI educational materials for staff to reference Start a weekly internal AI newsletter to share how teams are using AI Start a Slack or similar channel dedicated for AI education, AI news updates, knowledge sharing, etc Start a weekly and optional one-hour AMA meeting for everyone to ask everyone else questions (highly effective) Create a regular schedule for staff to report back to leadership or department heads about how they’re using AI and what they’re achieving with it Phase 5: Success Tracking I kick off every AI presentation identifying the three AI models mentioned above—ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity—followed by the assertion that, "AI is the death of 'I don't know.'" That is arguably the biggest ROI for integrating AI in a DMO or any other type of organization. There are few questions that are too complex or too intimidating for DMO staff to approach with confidence and conviction if they know how to use those three AI models effectively. I shared an example previously where I used Perplexity Pro to educate myself about how board governance is evolving . That for me was something I knew was out of my realm of expertise, but now I feel I can speak with some semblance of authority about that to any board because of AI. Before gen AI, I dismissed board governance as one of those things I'd just have to leave in the dark. That said, trying to explain how AI helps staff become more self-reliant, where they can always build a foundation of understanding for anything to empower themselves, only goes so far with a board. They're looking for more quantitative KPIs. Here are just some examples of that in a DMO context. In 2025, defining KPIs for AI integration is an evolving science, and we as an industry are still figuring a lot of this out. Therefore, this list is nowhere near comprehensive and it will evolve, but we have ample data today to validate the following: Using AI for search and content development saves significant time and increases opportunities for higher output and increased creativity for producing blog posts, social media, videos, marketing campaigns, etc. Developing custom GPTs (in ChatGPT Plus) for group sales is a proven strategy for creating better, more customized proposals in much less time. That gives sales staff more time for brainstorming and prospecting leading to higher production. That's a fact. In this case, group sales people are actually pumped to try a new technology. Using AI for regression analysis and scenario modeling increases the accuracy of how DMOs predict visitor volumes year-round, event attendance, economic impact, etc. One of the biggest conversations in DMOs today is how to develop content and websites to rank higher in AI search. Developing best practices in AI SEO leads to higher traffic. That is a core mandate for any DMO, and no DMO can afford to ignore that over time. AI chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI are driving real business. As described in PhocusWire in March, New York City Tourism + Conventions launched its GuideGeek-powered "Ellis" meeting-specific AI chat in January. ROI to date: 100% increase in traffic to the meeting planner website, 800+ AI-driven queries in the first month, 50% growth in newsletter sign-ups, and 10% increase in time spent on the site. Summary The AI train has left the station and it's gaining steam. The DMO AI Roadmap is the next logical step for helping DMO CEOs and their teams integrate AI processes and platforms. As Visit Mesa's Kate Yordi said, "Finally, we now have direction." That's a big deal for DMO staff to feel that way. Generative AI has been with us for more than two years now, but a structured and phased approach for integrating AI across DMO departments has been the missing piece. Visit Mesa's DMO AI Roadmap is going to evolve as the team works through the process, but at least now there's a vision and scope. Visit Mesa CEO Marc Garcia and the board are fully committed—a critical first step for embarking on this journey. Also, this strategic framework for how DMOs approach AI is going to underpin the interactive AI Playground activation at U.S. Travel's upcoming ESTO conference in Phoenix, August 17-19. U.S. Travel and GuideGeek are partnering to develop educational programming for the hands-on AI training experience and series of thought leadership. Greg Oates

How AI Improves DMO and Community Master Planning Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Many DMOs are developing 10-year destination master plans to optimize their visitor economy in alignment with local community priorities. I've participated in producing dozens of them from Miami to Mesa. They often take as long as a year to complete because there's so much focus on community engagement in various formats: interviews, focus groups, town halls, surveys, visioning sessions, etc. The tourism industry talks about the importance of community a LOT. However, when you're working with a DMO, you never really dig into what actually moves the needle across so many endless community demands, not on a tactical and hyperlocal level. You're not really held accountable for any measure of success when it comes to community-specific initiatives, ranging from improving City Hall permitting processes for small businesses to tracking the movement of unhoused. A master plan needs to address those and amplify those kinds of pressing needs for the destination overall. The expectation is not really to fix them. That’s not the role of a DMO. It's a whole different ballgame when you're developing a long-term strategic framework for a community organization like Near Southside, Inc . in Fort Worth. Success and being accountable for fixing things is expected. Located at the periphery of the downtown core, Near Southside is the most interesting community in North America right now. The ex-industrial district can be loosely compared to Austin 20 years ago with the same cultural DNA and similar community values, based on a fiercely protective love for local, creative and independently owned small businesses. That's under threat. In the last few years, as Near Southside evolved into the coolest 'hood east and west of the Pecos Line, real estate prices are rising commensurately. We all know how this story often ends with the encroachment of national brands sanitizing the soul of a place that made it attractive in the first place. Near Southside is intent on rewriting that story. AI Processes for Strategic Planning Here's where AI comes in. Because of the multitude of overlapping challenges and evolving dynamics in the community, our team needs to crunch and debate a ton of qualitative and quantitative data. Addressing gentrification touches on so many aspects of how communities operate. Therefore, we are over-indexing on community engagement to get as many perspectives as possible to identify how the community best evolves in the face of rapid change. The amount of inputs we're getting is substantive, and we want to inventory all of it as thoroughly as possible to build a super comprehensive knowledge base for the AI to cull through, connect dots and output insights. Every individual zoom call with stakeholders is recorded with Granola AI, which produces full transcripts but the summaries are too light. So we created custom GPTs with instructions for everything we want in the summaries, including comprehensive overviews, key takeaways with detailed context for each, the most insightful quotes related to those takeaways, and all action items that stakeholders recommended. With the GPT, we can fire full transcripts into the chat, press "enter" and receive highly valuable, high quality and uniform summaries almost immediately. We're doing the same with the focus groups but the custom GPTs require a different set of instructions. The two-hour transcripts capture the conversations with 10-20 stakeholders convened across specific industry and community segments. For those, the GPTs bucket corresponding high-level takeaways and tactical action items related to the same theme. That has immeasurable value because these conversations are all over the place. It's great working with locals who are so passionate about where they live and how, but that means you're getting feedback from a firehose and someone taking notes doesn’t capture all the nuance. Using custom GPTs to produce these summaries and populate takeaways is as good or better than any team could do manually. Everything is stored in Airtable. Forget Google or Microsoft cloud platforms. Airtable is an AI-powered, relational database/spreadsheet beast for organizing data and automating basic workflows. The tables combine all project information in one place, such as a running list of pending/completed interviews and focus groups and their AI-generated summaries. Airtable can then auto-generate a summary of the summary in the same table for clients to easily review everything being collected on a daily basis to whatever degree they prefer. Once you use Airtable, you'll never look at Google Drive the same way again. I've never had so many insights so well organized, so thorough and so easy to share with a team and client to help inform each project phase. The client loves the transparency, immediacy and structure, naturally, versus waiting for the next weekly update to read a few bullet points in a PowerPoint. Here's the thing. Because we've been so intentional about collecting such a high quality and comprehensive volume of feedback, we have a motherlode of a knowledge base for AI to work with. We can then enter all that in bulk into Google NotebookLM or ChatGPT/Claude Projects to pull out anything from high-level aggregate takeaways to anything super customized or tactical. For example, the client was interested in hearing specifically just what developers had to say about gentrification. I wanted highlights related to anything discussed regarding City Hall processes. It’s super easy to pull reports together for those and anything else. Ultimately, you can use AI to deliver an outline, a strategy map and a very rough draft of a destination master plan. All you need to do is combine all of the above together, plus PDFs of all relevant public and private planning documents, PDFs of all relevant case studies and best practices, and detailed instructions about the purpose, elements, structure, etc., of the plan. People will disagree, sure. I'm not dismissing the expertise of people who put these things together, because they bring deep context to every conversation and decision made during the development of a master plan. Everything happening now in Near Southside has happened somewhere else. When you can bring takeaways from those places to any present situation, it helps provide direction for everyone in the room. Again, I’m not saying that AI is replacing humans. People get all kinds of worked up over that, especially in travel and tourism. I am saying you can create a better, more strategic and more informed master plan in a much more streamlined fashion when you employ AI strategically to better prepare a community for the future. That's just a fact. I have four more community focus groups today in Near Southside. The expectation among everyone is that their contributions will make a demonstrable difference in their neighborhood. We can’t just speak to the challenges. We need to fix them and our processes with AI are giving everyone more confidence that we can deliver on that. Wondering how many DMOs are interested in employing similar AI-first strategies to get a better handle on how to help their communities. Greg Oates

How Visit Richmond is Using AI to Sell More Conventions Aug 2 Written By Greg Oates DMO CEOs want specific use cases for AI showing how they drive measurable business results. Here's a great example for capitalizing on AI to drive meetings and conventions volume from Lauran Peoples , director of sales marketing and business development at Visit Richmond in Virginia. Peoples works in the organization's 13-person sales team and reports to the VP of sales. Her role has three core functions: She is the main liaison between the destination sales and marketing departments; she develops and leads campaign strategy for the sales department; and she works with her colleagues to optimize strategic partnerships. Peoples' role is somewhat unique as a liaison between sales and marketing in that she lives on the sales side, versus marketing. She also stands out in our industry as an emerging voice in AI innovation. If you're going to U.S. Travel's ESTO conference this month in Phoenix, look for her and me working in the show's inaugural AI Playground educational activation. Greg Oates: Can you explain your role at Visit Richmond, specifically in terms of how you bridge the sales and marketing teams? Lauran Peoples: It's becoming more common in DMOs for sales teams to have a marketing liaison, but usually that person is based on the marketing team and is mostly assigned to sales to help with creative. The issue is when that marketing liaison is based on the marketing team, they don't have much exposure to the field and what's happening out of market with your salespeople. Our sales team has 45 trade shows this upcoming fiscal year, so they're traveling almost every week. With my situation in Richmond, they're getting real-time data and downloads about what's happening in each destination, so that gives them more authentic conversations to engage planners. Not having someone assigned to a team like that creates a huge disconnect and leaves opportunity on the table. GO: Tell us a little about your journey with AI. LP: I've been working in hospitality for 20 years. Last year, I heard some younger people on the team talking about ChatGPT. So I was like, okay, I don't know anything about that. I went to PCMA Convening Leaders in January and the opening session was all about AI. I remember sitting there feeling like a dinosaur. Feeling very behind. I realized this is a lot more serious and widespread than I thought, so I left and tasked myself with using ChatGPT once a day. Initially, I couldn't differentiate how it wasn't like Google. I was asking it how many tablespoons are in this or that, kind of thing. Since then, my understanding of AI has progressively increased around more complex and comprehensive capabilities. It has streamlined my productivity, but more importantly, AI has become a thought partner for me to bounce all these ideas and scenarios around that I didn't have before. I think that a lot of people are adopting AI and using it as a communications assistant, or a writing assistant. But the part for me that's really exciting and valuable with AI is analyzing and aggregating data and getting it to show you things that you need help with, like sales. GO: Can you share an example? LP: Sure. I took five datasets: five years of lost business, five years of definite business, and three marketing reports from different campaigns we were running with outside agencies like Sojourn and Digital Edge. Those campaigns give us demographic insights because we were targeting certain areas. I also grabbed our sales deployment sheet, which tells you who has what market. I uploaded all of those into ChatGPT and asked it to identify the top five locations for each of our managers based on their market segments. Some results weren't surprising, but there were a few that popped up like Orlando that we've never traditionally considered. When I asked ChatGPT why Orlando, it showed how the city has a large hobby market. It turns out there are a lot of hobby conventions that meet in Orlando. After I compiled the top five locations for each manager, I asked ChatGPT to give me the top five accounts in each of those locations. Then I asked for unique selling propositions for each of those accounts as to why Richmond would be a perfect fit. Finally, I asked it to rank those five destinations based on probability of success. GO: Have you seen any of this result in new business opportunities? LP: Yes. One location that showed up was Philadelphia. Richmond is four hours from Philadelphia, but like Orlando it hasn't typically been on our radar. However, based on the data from ChatGPT, Philly came up as a recommendation. So we sent one of our sales managers to Philadelphia, and she ended up hosting 18 planners, including some who drove from over an hour away to see her. She got such a great response that I had to jump in and go with her because she couldn't host 18 clients by herself. AI has now informed our sales strategy for Philly, and the region is now part of our dedicated sales strategy. We've allocated funds for that sales manager in Philly to join chapters of organizations like MPI and PCMA. So that's how we know there had to be some accuracy to our approach with AI. GO: How do the sales managers feel about you doing this AI analysis? LP: They appreciate it. It's a balance because most sales managers at DMOs aren't entry level; they've been in hospitality for a long time. This is a new process and a new tool for them. Some have destinations they like to go to over and over because they're successful there. But my role is to support business enablement and sales enablement to help them do what they do better and uncover new business. So how we're using AI provides them with additional actionable research. GO: I think one of the most underrated strategies for AI is developing custom GPTs in ChatGPT to help sales teams develop more customized and effective proposals more quickly. Are you building those at all? LP: Yes, definitely. About a month and a half ago, I programmed a GPT for the sales team called "Prospecting Partner." It's trained on our sales collateral and all our information, so it knows our convention packages and understands our jurisdiction and seven localities. The sales managers have been using it to prospect smarter. I included suggested prompts to go beyond just, "Give me a prospecting email." We can get really specific, like, "Help me re-engage an association planner who just lost grant funding." It also provides strategies specifically related to that, and then you can ask how to execute those strategies. So, for example, we know from reports that finance and insurance is an opportunity market for us. It's a small percentage of our current business but it has the highest average daily rate, which makes it very attractive to our hotel partners. So our salespeople are asking ChatGPT for ways we can develop business in the finance and insurance market, and really dig into that. Ultimately, AI is helping our sales team think bigger, smarter and more strategically. I've asked the sales team if they found this helpful, and, you know, salespeople are not an easy crowd. They said yes across the board. With the ChatGPT Enterprise version, I can't see their exact prompts due to privacy, but I can see the number of conversations they're having with the tool, so I know they're actively using it. GO: How are other people on your team using AI? LP: My two direct reports are our CRM database administrator and our sales coordinator. My sales coordinator does support work for the entire team, so she's using ChatGPT a lot for ideation, like when a sales manager needs an itinerary to entertain clients in Chicago. My CRM database administrator uses ChatGPT as a communication assistant because sometimes analytical personality types can benefit from exploring more communication nuances. She's also started incorporating it into data cleanup, using it to analyze reports and suggest what's missing or what would be beneficial. She uses it to help fill in gaps and identify what's not being asked or said. GO: What are some of your future plans with AI? LP: We're launching microsites for destination sales and sports, and I think it will set a model for the rest of the organization because we’re replacing our website from pre- to post-AI, like most DMO sites these days. We're currently writing copy for the microsites, and I've been getting into structured data and semantic clarity. You don't search ChatGPT or prompt ChatGPT with the same language you search Google, so content has to be written differently. Previously, you'd go to Google and say "restaurants near me." Now with ChatGPT, it's more of a conversation, so you'll say, "Hey, I'm in Scott's Addition historic district in Richmond with my kids, and we're looking for a vegan restaurant." That semantic clarity allows AI to respond with much more specific answers. I think we need to anticipate AI searches, as opposed to Google searches, in how we write content. Everyone is subconsciously expecting a personally curated experience today. When I go on Amazon, I'm expecting it to make connections that I like this, so I might also like this, without me having to tell it certain things. That's where we have to move towards, or we get eclipsed or become obsolete, especially if we're just thinking of ourselves as brokers for a destination. Greg Oates

Visit Phoenix CEO on Leading AI Strategy and Being Chill About It Jul 28 Written By Greg Oates I learned a lot about how DMO leaders can confidently integrate AI processes into their organizations after speaking with Ron Price, CDME, president and CEO of Visit Phoenix. Price is somewhat new to AI but his staff have been doing cool things with various LLMs for a while. He says his primary role with AI is providing the Visit Phoenix team with an enabling environment for success built on a culture of trust. Price accomplishes that by inspiring everyone to experiment with AI, be aware of the liabilities, share their wins, have fun with it, reach out to others for advice, and most of all, validate everything. Although, what stood out for me the most talking with Price is his calm and clear approach to AI, basically inferring (in my words, not his)... "We got this. We might do something amazing today with AI or we might not, but either way we're fully committed to seeing what it can do. We're also going to figure this AI thing out by collaborating with our many DMO industry friends. Because AI is going to change everything in a hurry, and we at Visit Phoenix are not going to be caught staring out at a Sonoran sunset while the world passes our city by." That's the vibe I got. That's leadership. That's what being a CEO means, at least for me. AI is confusing, sure, and CEOs have to worry about their boards and electeds. The thing is, we're more than two and a half years into generative AI now, and it's not going to wait for CEOs to decide if they can "trust AI" or not. I think we can all learn from Price a few things: We can de-escalate all the hubris and hand-wringing surrounding AI by being open to possibilities and having a clear set of principles, especially related to responsible AI use and verification. You can have fun with AI and focus on business outcomes at the same time. The DMO industry needs to collaborate and share best practices more intentionally to accelerate AI education, innovation and integration. We must encourage DMO staff to use AI today so they can steer the future of our industry tomorrow. Price likes talking about AI. I would encourage any DMO CEOs on the fence with AI to reach out to him. Greg Oates: Ron, how do you use AI? Ron Price: I use AI every single day, going back now about a month and a half. I'm just fascinated and interested in what it's able to do. I wouldn't say I'm an early adopter, of course, although there are some people who aren't even on it yet. Me personally, I use it for everything, like if I'm curious about something that's happening within the region. Or maybe I want to quickly compile a lot of data to help solve a problem or answer questions as I get ready for different meetings. More or less, my brain is always just firing, like, "What if we tried this or that?" And so, this year has been a cool realization about what AI can do, and seeing how it's pulling all the sources through to validate what it responds with. We have also integrated AI with Microsoft Copilot. We pay for everyone to have access to that, and then we also have a ChatGPT Team account for our staff. GO: Where else are you seeing value with AI at Visit Phoenix? RP: In our world, it's marketing, it's content. I love being surrounded by people who can write really well. It's an art to me, and I don't possess that art. It's like someone playing the piano. I'm in awe of that. So AI gives people the ability to write better, and it's okay to lean into it. Don't feel threatened by it. AI is able to give you that one golden nugget, or it suggests that one good idea that can really help someone when they're writing. Here's the fun part. Every day, we're learning something unique. We have the Cronkite School of Journalism in Phoenix, and some of the students are here. We kind of give them free rein, and we're also teaching them at the same time. The way that they use AI is amazing. It's fun to walk down the hall to see them because I'm always like, "How did you write that? How did you create that image? How did you pull that data and research together?" It's just a different generation. We're also seeing where our people are asking AI things like, "If I'm a salesperson, how do I influence a group to come here in the middle of the summer for a conference? Why is it fun to be here for a conference when it's 110 degrees out?" And what does AI have to say? Well, one thing that's great about, say, Grok, for example, it's pulling from all these little texts on Twitter, or X. They're from people saying, "Hey, I know it's summertime in Phoenix but look what I got to do." Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use. GO: Does your staff using AI increase your organization's impact in the community? RP: We not only focus on growing tourism in our community, but we're also joined at the hip with economic development. We look at our role as we're here to build a better community through tourism. And so, when you think about utilizing all the data out there, we always ask ourselves, "How could AI help us consolidate that data and crunch the numbers faster to give us a clearer picture of what we think we know?" For example, how much business that comes in through our leads touch our priority sectors? And of those sectors, which ones align extremely well with what we're doing here at Visit Phoenix? Is it semiconductors? Is it bio-med? Is it something that leans into the engineering side because of what ASU and the Department of Defense are doing? We've seen we can go back and look at the data and get a better picture of those things now. Also, as an example, we have a high propensity to book business around the semiconductor space. So we're utilizing these AI tools to quickly do research like, "Give me a list of the top semiconductor conferences that take place around the world." The responses are quicker and the results are better versus doing a traditional Google search. It's able to pull from a lot of different sources, so that's another way we're using AI. “Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use.” GO: How do you define the role of a CEO to guide a DMO forward with AI? RP: Setting up the rules of the game is important. There are areas of liability we have to be aware of about what you can and can't be pulling in. Those are the types of things we needed to figure out, you know, basically, "What is our rule book for using AI?" I like giving people the ability to use AI as they will. I think it works best whenever people know that it's a tool we want them to utilize. And if it can help us at the end of the day tell a better story, be smarter as we go after business, and be smarter with our analytics to help build our marketing strategy stronger, then use it. I try to build a team of leaders so they're CEOs of their own divisions, and I want them to be thought leaders in their areas. Also, I think AI enables us to get to answers quickly, but, and this is important, how do we validate those answers? We're really good at Visit Phoenix when it comes to validating answers, but we're usually doing it by going the long way and understanding how AI responded like it did. We're reading source by source by source, and then we kind of come to our own conclusion. It's like we're not just focused on the punch line of a joke. We can also tell you the structure of the joke. You always have to validate. We get excited about using AI because it just puts us in a new position. I think it's good to have a CEO that supports that, but that support comes from a trust within the organization. I trust that people are going to utilize AI to help make us better. GO: What keeps you up at night regarding AI? RP: My fear is how do we control and ensure that someone isn't producing something negative on our behalf, and then launching it to the world, and using this incredible tool to hurt us? Because there are people that are extremely gullible who believe whatever they're looking at. That's kind of where my brain goes sometimes. It's only because of what I've already seen these tools can do. I think across the DMO industry, we'll have some "ahas," especially when we get together in various forums to exchange ideas. We need to be talking with each other about, "Here are some things that work really well with AI, and here are the headwinds." And then, "These are the things you need to realize could happen with AI, and here are some ways you can mitigate those problems." The more we can learn from others about how they're using AI, the better. I think what you're putting together about AI strategy with all your insights is going to be extremely valuable. GO: Thank you. So, what are you thinking about next with AI? RP: As AI continues to grow, and we've talked about it here internally, what is the value of a website? In fact, we just started our next fiscal year, July 1. Website visits is no longer a key metric that we're going after. As a leader, I like knowing what's three steps ahead. We currently have these tools, but how are they going to change the way we make decisions going forward? At some point, a lot of what we're talking about now is going to be white noise. And what then? It doesn't mean our jobs of promoting a destination change. It means we're going to get so much better at telling our story through so many different avenues. I believe that our reach is actually going to broaden. We're still going to be responsible for promoting our destination and selling our destination, but how we tell the story and how we show the story is going to change as these tools evolve. Back in the day, a lot of us were reading about Moore's Law and how things just keep improving and getting cheaper, especially in technology. Now we're moving into a space where the rate of growth with AI is going to be something we've never seen before. Greg Oates

German Convention Bureau Leader on the Future of AI-Powered Meetings Jul 27 Written By Greg Oates After the global financial crisis ended in 2011, a few cities and nations around the world began promoting themselves to meeting and convention organizers based on their intellectual capital, versus venues and attractions. Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau (GCB), led this strategy in Europe at the time. Around the same year, I was visiting the House of Logistics & Mobility (HOLM) think tank in Frankfurt. The GCB suggested I visit there to better understand this new direction for attracting high-value business events in advanced industries. "The city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," Dr. Stefan Walter told me, who was a professor at HOLM at the time. "So, this [GCB] strategy is about finding the strengths of our strengths, our core competencies, and for Germany, that’s knowledge and infrastructure. It’s also about connecting ideas.” That has been my due north working in the travel industry ever since. This idea that meeting planners and attendees can tap into a deep knowledge base in a host destination, specific to their interests, for me, is intoxicating. The challenge is it takes a ton of work connecting local leaders in specific advanced industries, like aviation in Frankfurt or e-mobility in Stuttgart, with large global organizations in those same industries and convince them to bring their big annual event to Germany. It's also pretty high level. From an attendee standpoint, if I'm in Hamburg and want to learn about HafenCity, the largest urban makeover in Europe, it's not like I can easily access a bunch of people and organizations leading the future of urban development. Which, would be cool, right? AI is helping make that a reality. Germany's national Open Data/Knowledge Graph project is an ambitious AI-powered initiative to build a massive network of industry suppliers, academic organizations and business leaders across the country. Basically, by indexing the visitor industry and intellectual capital supply chain, Germany can connect the brightest minds in Germany with the rest of the world more seamlessly, effectively and equitably. An "interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," if you will. I spoke with Mr. Schultze to learn more about how AI is impacting the meetings and convention industry in Germany. Greg Oates: How is AI evolving across Germany's visitor industry? Specifically, how are your municipal CVBs and other partners thinking about and using AI right now? Matthias Schultze: Like much of the world, things really accelerated for us around two years ago with the rise of tools like ChatGPT. Suddenly, everyone, from corporates to associations, started thinking seriously about AI. We saw an opportunity and created an innovation platform called ebx.lab . It’s a peer-to-peer learning community for event planners, where we partner with scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute to explore how AI might reshape the business events space. From those early sessions, we have published a few white papers and identified a few core insights. AI clearly has potential to personalize experiences, optimize event planning processes, improve engagement and networking, and maybe most exciting, support predictive analytics. That last one, especially, being able to anticipate trends or behaviors based on data, is what feels most transformative to me personally. GO: How is the GCB embracing AI internally? MS: We developed our own internal AI strategy for the German Convention Bureau. We wanted to give both our team and our stakeholders a shared framework, something that outlined where we are today, where we want to go, and how we get there. It’s called "Driven by People, Powered by Data," and that title really reflects our belief that AI is a tool, not a solution in itself. People need to lead the process. The strategy helps us clarify not just what we can do with AI, but also what we can’t or shouldn’t do, at least not yet. It outlines our roadmap and aligns everyone across our organization and membership. GO: Is that strategy available publicly? MS: Yes, though only in German for now. But with the right AI tools, you can translate it quickly. The strategy touches on everything from marketing and communications to event planning, workflow automation, customer personalization, sustainability, and even ethics and compliance. The ethics component is particularly important. As exciting as AI is, we have to keep guardrails in place. Within our organization, we’re working hard to ensure that AI isn’t something siloed or limited to leadership. It needs to be embedded across every level. Everyone in the organization is expected to develop basic AI literacy. We’ve also worked on minimum viable products for things like dashboards and customer-facing chatbots. Some are already in use today. GO: You've always been a strong and vocal proponent for sustainability in business events. How is AI supporting you there? MS: I’m very proud of a project we developed with 29 other European countries: the Sustainability Hub for Events . It’s an AI-driven platform that brings together all kinds of sustainability related data—certifications, guidelines, best practices—and makes them accessible through an interactive AI agent. Planners can ask things like, “Can you help me build a sustainable menu?” or input event details to estimate their CO₂ footprint. It’s highly practical, and it’s making a real difference for event planners who need fast, reliable and actionable sustainability information. GO: We've talked about your Open Data and Knowledge Graph project in Germany numerous times in the past. Is that now live? MS: It’s technically live but still in progress, and probably always will be, in a sense. We’re continuously expanding it. The Open Data Germany project by the German National Tourist Board is live with its Knowledge Graph. The Open Data MICE project, which is implemented in close cooperation with the GNTB, is not yet live. One exciting element launching soon is an interactive map of research institutions in Germany. It will show where key research and innovation is taking place, including medical tech, renewable energy and so on, and link that data to infrastructure like hotels and conference venues. The idea is to visualize Germany as a knowledge landscape. If you’re planning an event and you want to anchor it around a theme like urban mobility, the map will show you which regions are most active in that field and match you with the relevant venues and experts. GO: One theme I keep obsessing about, and it's felt like a bit of a fantasy for more than a decade, is that the city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine. That idea is a direct quote from your House of Logistics and Mobility in Frankfurt, and it’s stuck with me ever since I heard it back in 2011. It's this idea of a city as a platform. Do you think we're getting closer to executing on this idea, where innovation at all levels is more accessible and shareable for more people? Ultimately what we're talking about here is the democratization of knowledge and excellence. MS: I love that idea. I really do. I think there are two layers to it. On one level, we have the smart city movement with systems that integrate transportation, energy, data and infrastructure to make better decisions. That’s already happening in many places across Europe. But on a deeper level, regarding your fantasy.... Let's say you could land in Munich, be interested in urban tech, and immediately connect with people, events and institutions aligned with that interest—that’s becoming possible too. The data already exists. It’s just scattered. But with open data standards, machine readability, and the right AI tools, we can start connecting those dots. Your fantasy city may not be so far off.

A CEO's Playbook for AI Integration Oct 10 Written By Greg Oates Your competitors are talking about AI. Your board is asking about AI. Your partners want to see your AI strategy. Many DMOs are debating the potential of AI, while an increasing number of others are already extracting real business and organizational value. The difference isn't budget or technical talent. It's knowing exactly where to look for opportunities and how to scale what works. 3 Non-Negotiables You Must Lead This, Not Delegate It: AI transformation dies in committee. The organizations seeing real results have CEOs who champion specific initiatives, remove bureaucratic friction, and signal that AI adoption is a strategic priority. This doesn't mean micromanaging prompts. It means creating air cover for teams to experiment and fail fast. Complex Impresses, Simple Delivers: Your instinct will be to pursue the flashy, sophisticated AI applications that sound impressive in board presentations. Resist it. The organizations generating real ROI start with mundane problems: expense report processing, meeting summarization, competitive monitoring, etc. These boring use cases build organizational confidence and create the foundation for more ambitious projects. Your People Know Where the Problems Are: The best AI applications emerge from the intersection of daily frustration and technological possibility. Run hackathons. Create cross-functional workshops. Ask your teams what they do that feels like waste. The solutions they surface will be more practical and impactful than anything your consultants recommend. Start Here Stop looking for AI opportunities everywhere. Focus your organization's attention on three specific areas where AI creates immediate, measurable value. The Tedium Tax: Every role in your organization includes mind-numbing tasks that consume time without creating value: data entry, compliance documentation, procurement reports, staff vacation tracking, etc. Think of these as your "Anti To-Do List." These are tasks systematically eliminated by asking, "How can I never have to do this again?" Your teams are paying a tedium tax every day. AI is the refund. The Expertise Bottleneck: Projects stall when teams hit the limits of their skills and wait for other departments. Marketing needs data analysis and campaign design mockups. Finance and HR need custom GPTs. Sales needs meetings-related technical specifications translated into customer language. AI breaks these bottlenecks by giving every team superpowers they never had before. The Blank Page Problem: Knowledge work involves ambiguous challenges where the path forward isn't clear: Strategy development, market analysis, problem diagnosis, etc. AI excels at generating multiple approaches, analyzing incomplete information, and proposing next steps when your teams are stuck. It's the thinking partner that's always available and never runs out of ideas. 6 Use Cases OpenAI's analysis of 600+ successful implementations across various industries reveals that virtually every valuable AI application falls into one of six categories. Show your teams these six use cases and they'll start finding opportunities everywhere. Content Creation: Use AI for first drafts of everything: strategy documents, marketing campaigns, product and experience descriptions, customer and community communications. AI maintains your brand voice while eliminating the blank page problem. Research and Synthesis: AI powers information gathering at superhuman speed, including market analysis, competitive intelligence, customer feedback synthesis, regulatory research, etc.. AI doesn't just find information. It structures it exactly how you need it for decision-making. Coding for Everyone: Your non-technical teams can now write Python scripts, SQL queries, and data visualizations. Your engineering teams debug faster and prototype in unfamiliar languages. AI democratizes technical capability while accelerating your experts. Data Analysis Without Degrees: Upload spreadsheets, dashboard screenshots or raw data files and get structured analysis without requiring PhD-level statistics knowledge. This is arguably the most undervalued opportunity that delivers immediate results for most DMOs. Strategic Thinking Partner: AI is a beast for brainstorming, scenario planning, product and event development, asset mapping, risk analysis, etc. AI helps structure complex problems and identifies considerations your teams might miss. This is my favorite use case for AI. Intelligent Automation: Use platforms like n8n, Relay and others to create repeatable processes that run themselves, such as weekly competitive updates, financial reporting, sales and marketing workflows, a ton of admin duties, etc. Create the process once, then let AI handle the execution while humans focus on exceptions and strategy. Implementation is Where DMOs Fail Most AI initiatives fail because organizations treat them like traditional software deployments. They're not. AI is about change management and behavioral transformation up and down the org chart. AI implementation requires different approaches to discovery, prioritization and scaling. Systematic Opportunity Hunting: Don't wait for AI use cases to emerge organically. Run structured discovery sessions where teams audit their workflows for repetitive tasks, skill bottlenecks, and ambiguous challenges. Make this process ongoing, not a one-time exercise. The Impact-Effort Matrix: Not every AI opportunity deserves attention. Prioritize based on business impact versus implementation effort. Quick wins build momentum. High-value, high-effort projects become strategic investments. Everything else gets parked until technology makes it easier. Innovation as Culture: Internal competitions accelerate discovery while building AI literacy across your organization. The goal isn't technical sophistication. It's practical business solutions that teams actually want to use. Measure What Matters: Track time saved, accuracy improved, costs reduced and capability expansion. But also measure qualitative impacts: employee satisfaction, process improvements, competitive advantages. Use this data to guide scaling decisions. Build Your AI Process Move beyond random experimentation to systematic capability building. I like Estée Lauder's 5-phase process to ensure repeatable success with AI. Does this resonate with you for your DMO? Design: Define your purpose, scope and success criteria for AI integration in a 2-page brief. No scope creep. No technical complexity for its own sake. Prepare: Ask department heads to gather relevant data and best practices. AI tools should reflect organizational knowledge, not generic approaches. Build and Test: Hire contractors where necessary to help teams develop automations/agents, implement training, integrate datasets and validate accuracy. Focus on usability, not just functionality. Launch: Deploy with user guides and change management support. Technology deployment is easy. User adoption across all departments is a total headache at first. Optimize: Feedback loops drive continuous improvement based on actual usage patterns. AI applications evolve with business needs and improved capabilities. Key Insight: Always start with fundamental questions: Why build this? What problem does it solve? What impact will it have? Is the measurement for success quantitative or qualitative? Organizations that answer these questions clearly will build more successful AI applications than those focused primarily on technical capability. Build AI-Native Workflows The most sophisticated implementations integrate AI across entire business processes rather than individual tasks. This evolution positions organizations for the agentic AI capabilities coming next. Process Decomposition: Break complex workflows into constituent tasks, identify where each AI use case category adds value, and create integrated approaches spanning from research through execution. Marketing workflows might integrate research for market understanding, analysis for opportunity mapping, ideation for strategy, content creation for product and destination development, and automation for distribution. Cross-Functional Integration: AI facilitates better collaboration by translating between departments. Technical specifications become marketing language. Customer requirements inform sales priorities. Financial models drive strategic planning. Future-Proofing for Agents: Current workflow integration prepares your organization for AI agents that can complete entire projects independently. Teams that understand how to break processes into AI-addressable components will leverage these capabilities immediately when available. The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done. This cognitive shift creates advantages that compound over time and become increasingly difficult for competitors to replicate. "The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done." Key Takeaways The question isn't whether AI will transform our industry. It's whether you'll be leading that transformation or reacting to it. Start with clear, achievable use cases and systemic approaches to build the organizational muscle needed for transformation. AI advantage isn't about having the most technical teams or biggest budgets. It's about developing capabilities for organization-wide discovery, adoption, implementation and scaling of practical business solutions. The organizations moving beyond experimentation to systematic implementation today will be best positioned to leverage the more sophisticated AI capabilities emerging tomorrow. The agents are coming. Will you be ready? Greg Oates

The ROI of AI Agents Aug 21 Written By Greg Oates Based on a bunch of conversations at DI Annual 2025 this month, it's clear that many DMO executives still equate generative AI primarily with writing and editing in ChatGPT. But as one COO of a large U.S. DMO told me, "Surely there's more to all this than just learning about prompting." So many ways to respond to that. Meanwhile, there are also DMO leaders who established AI road maps for their organizations going back two years. For them, they're increasingly focused on developing AI-powered automated workflows and their more sophisticated cousins, AI agents. The purpose of these synthetic workflows is to automate tedious, time-consuming and repetitive tasks to free up staff to focus on more high-value work. Think of it as an evolution from using AI to building AI. You begin by visually mapping what people do in your organization. Then you identify where AI can potentially take over all the mundane stuff better and faster. I’ve been working with my colleagues at Matador Network to develop automated workflows for our Studio team. We have endless terabytes of client video created during the last 10 years. Now, with AI, we want to capitalize on those existing assets to create new video, but first we need to use AI to understand what we actually own. We contracted Erick Bonilla , founder of Pocho.tech based in Uruguay, to build a series of new AI workflows in n8n. One of the automations is designed to cull through 10 years of video files in Dropbox and catalogue everything in Airtable. The AI then creates standardized file names, project IDs, links for raw edited videos and finished client hero/cutdown videos, and location and content tags. The cost to develop the AI workflow was about $2,000 all-in, and it saved more than a month of work at a mid-level manager salary. The beauty of automations/agents is you can measure ROI annually fairly easily, which will help wake up your board if they're sleeping on AI. Moreover, once an automation is in place, the savings will continue to accrue in the future indefinitely for tasks still required, and there’s zero human error. During a staff Zoom, I asked members of our Studio team if they felt these new agents signaled to them the beginning of the end of some people’s jobs. The response was unanimous. Nobody wants to do this type of repetitive grunt work. I spoke with Bonilla for his take on the future of AI agents. Greg Oates: Erick, what services does Pocho.tech provide? Erick Bonilla: We identify opportunities within organizations of all sizes, where we believe implementing AI systems can dramatically improve the efficiency of operations. We can create workflows that process data, or we can create AI agents capable of reasoning, analyzing data, creating reports, and providing decision-makers with an enhanced way of digesting information. I have been doing this for almost two years, working with people mostly in the Middle East, the US and Latin America. The Pocha company site is brand new as I try to expand in the world of AI. GO: What’s the difference between automated workflows and agents? EB: A workflow is like a mass production factory. It's a set of operations that work through specific logic to automate a repetitive process that a human has done before. This could be writing and reading emails, writing summaries, reformatting and transferring content through different tools and applications, etc. An AI agent is a thinking environment that makes decisions for you. You can set a workflow for reading your emails. But then you can have an AI agent that summarizes your emails and tells you, if you have 10 emails, what those 10 emails are about in just one email, SMS text, WhatsApp message, Google doc or whatever. GO: So an AI agent has more autonomy and decision-making capabilities than an automated workflow? EB: Definitely. The AI agent is capable of being completely autonomous to make decisions within a given context. You give it a context with defined restrictions that narrows the scope of the decisions it can make. GO: Can you provide any success stories where you worked with a client who had a specific challenge, and you created an automated workflow or agent that successfully delivered a solution? EB: The most recent example is an EdTech company in Boston that provides a training and placement program for clean energy jobs. They've been operating for the past five years, but there’s been a lack of funds, employees and program applicants to scale beyond Massachusetts. So they decided to use AI and automation to build flows without having to invest a lot of money in hiring people. What I did was streamline the application process for people interested in entering the educational program. We created a form and a workflow that takes the information from the application and puts it into an application tracking system. This system has workflows that can trigger emails, daily reports, weekly reports and invitations to interview. Then I created an AI agent. Once the applicants are interviewed by a human, we take the transcript of that, analyze it using AI, and build a report for the decision maker so they can decide if this person is capable of entering the program or not. We also created a scoring system. We built it based on human criteria, which is subjective, and then we converted that into an objective dataset so we could classify people and score them based on numbers. All of this is done by an AI agent that sets a score for the applicant at the end of the interview. Then we have a leaderboard where people are ranked, and the top 15 get into the education program and placement process. GO: Were they happy with the end result? EB: Oh yeah, very happy. Here's where the beauty and magic come in. Now the CEO can envision a way of expanding outside Massachusetts, and tell her team, "Hey, we're going to New York!" Where before, she thought she needed to hire more people in each new state to oversee the operation. And, because an AI agent works 24/7, she doesn't have to wait until 8am to get a report or transcription, or anything anymore. So now, she can think about how to scale her company more successfully without having to hire more people. GO: What's the road map looking ahead? Where are you going with the company in terms of next steps? EB: We're trying to create an outreach system because the purpose of the company is not only to train people but also to place them in clean tech job positions. The outreach system is going to help the team find more companies with open positions, so the company can place more people in those positions. We’re building a system involving AI agents and workflows where we're going to take a picture of all the open positions and analyze and understand them using AI. We want to know, what are the requirements in terms of learning and knowledge capacity for people to get in these positions, so the company can build a better training program. GO: What was the biggest challenge working with them? EB: I think the most important one, and this is something anyone working on this will experience, is the resistance of some team members who don't trust the performance of AI enough. People who have low experience working with AI, and maybe only know ChatGPT, will look at this and say, "I don't believe this can work." So that means there’s a lot of educational work. People need enough knowledge about what AI tools are capable of to suggest what can and can’t work. I think that's the main challenge. But once people see it working, they start to lean into AI. Suddenly, they become like, "This is great. Can you add this other metric? Can you make it do this other thing too? Can you make me one for my personal side hustle?" It's interesting when you see people moving from resistance to acceptance. GO: Working with you has firmly cemented something I've been preoccupied with this year. It's this: One of the most exciting things about AI, which is giving us more time back during the day, requires the most boring thing, which is having uniform file and data structure. As we've discovered together only too well, AI can't reach its full potential unless you have everything structured super cleanly. The analogy I often use is that AI is like an 8-year-old savant. The person is brilliant but he or she often needs really consistent environments and clear guardrails, or things go sideways or just crash. Can you talk about what any organization needs to focus on when it comes to file and data structure? EB: I think one of the most basic things, and I'm living this with a company I'm helping right now, is documenting files and folders exactly the same. You must set protocols for everything when you’re building a folder system to store content and data. That's one of the biggest challenges for companies trying to implement AI automation with poorly standardized systems. When we didn’t have AI a few years ago, we didn't think of a machine reading our documents or files. We never thought that could be possible, so we never really focused on creating really good file structure. The biggest challenge for companies, coming back to Matador, is how to organize the field of play so that AI doesn't struggle. We easily lose the excitement of implementing AI in an organization when an AI is trying to navigate a maze of poorly organized files. For that, you need to build SOPs that tell everyone on the team, “We're going to be naming files this way now so that a 5-year-old can read the titles and understand what's in every one of them. Because if a 5-year-old can read this set of folders and understand what's inside all of them, then AI can do that too. And if AI can find and read everything, then AI can do some truly amazing things and save companies a lot of money. GO: So how are organizations like ours, which have been in operation for a long time, supposed to go back decades and reorganize all our files? EB: We can run a workflow that can do that for you. That's where the ROI comes in. You can make a one-time investment building a workflow that's going to completely standardize all your filing and foldering. But if you do that, you have to know that the ROI might not show up right away. It's going to start paying off later in terms of the time, money, stress and everything it’s going to give back. A CEO must understand that the return on that investment is going to be ongoing through the years, not in the next quarter necessarily. If you have that mentality, then your company is going to become AI-first. GO: You’ve told me before that AI is not a tool, it's a culture. Can you explain that? EB: Right now, the biggest obstacle for AI expanding in many companies are the CEOs. I understand the challenges because they fear a lot of reputational risk. You have a board and customers that are going to be judging you. If you don't have a very good AI road map, then it could turn into a failure, and the fingers are going to be pointing at you. I understand that completely. But AI should be a culture within companies, and that starts top down because the CEO has to embrace trial and error. AI is going to fail at least during the first time you start with any automation. It's like when you're building a prompt. We were talking the other day, and you said using AI is not about writing the perfect first prompt. It's that fifth or sixth prompt that's going to get you to the right answer. You're going to be iterating with automation, too. That's something CEOs have to transmit throughout the organization. GO: I think for many tourism organizations, we haven’t even begun talking about the big picture value of AI. From an internal perspective, for example, agents offer a whole new level for optimizing operations with AI. EB: Yes, exactly. When we're in a company and we're facing challenges, the first intuitive thinking is, "How can I solve this? I'm going to Google it.” Now we're transitioning to, "How can I solve this? I'm going to ask ChatGPT.” This is great, but that's not AI-first. That's changing one tool for another. You're still browsing. It's literally the same thing. You're not really using AI. AI-first means, "I do this thing that's consuming 10 hours a week. I do the same thing every time. I spend two hours every day doing the same four steps. How can I use AI to automate this?" That's AI-first because you're using AI to stop wasting time. I think that's the culture we should be striving for. If a CEO injects the whole company with that mindset, then the employees are going to eventually use AI to solve their issues more independently and autonomously. At the end of the day, what AI really does is gives us more time and more of our lives back, and we have not yet understood that because it's new. But it's true, AI is the way for humans to have more life. GO: I want that. EB: We all do. GO: I have this belief that eventually, in any organization, all meetings will be recorded and deposited into a central knowledge base where an AI can summarize everything and connect all the key takeaways. I might have a meeting and someone on the other side of the world has a meeting, and the AI will know we're talking about the same thing. It will see and surface how there's potential opportunity to connect our efforts. It's like one plus one equals three, or more. Do you think that's where we're going and that it will benefit companies? EB: Definitely. It's the most common sense thing to do, but I know it's also counterintuitive because there are many people who would not like to have all conversations recorded. The fidelity, the accuracy of the information, and it all being in one place and uniformly structured, is everything. You can have thousands of conversations and tell the AI, "Go here and search for this specific idea in all the transcripts where we have talked about that." You just need to build the SOPs. Then a human can quality control it and say, "This is right. This isn't right. Maybe we can tweak this, or build on that." GO: I’ve experienced this firsthand where people are vehemently against this idea of all company meetings being recorded. For many it portends that clichéd dystopic future we see in science fiction, where everything's controlled and you have no freedom, right? EB: I can see it too. We must remember that these tools can be turned off. If we let the technology control us, then that's on us. I think at the end of the day, it's about how do you balance the risk and rewards? This is something CEOs are used to. Do you prefer to live in blindness and have an uncompetitive company because you decided not to take that risk with automation? Or do you take the risk and have everything recorded, even though some people are going to say it’s Orwellian in a way, and even though ultimately it's going to improve everybody's life? We have to find that balance, and that’s the CEO’s role to determine what’s best overall for the company, customers and employees in the future. GO: Any last thoughts? EB: I think we are not quite there yet to know for sure the amount of ROI that is going to come from agents and automations. Definitely it is going to be positive ROI. For that, I'm completely sure. What I'm not sure is how do we measure ROI based on the anticipated lifetime value of the process? So much is changing so quickly and it's difficult to see the future. As the tools get better, then the workflow gets better too, so the ROI increases, right? Except, we don't really have models for that. For CEOs, I think, they have to try to envision how they can measure the value of automations now, and how that might evolve exponentially in the future. Greg Oates

What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates CEOs at destination marketing and management organizations (DMOs) are seeking AI guidance specifically tailored to their chief executive roles. A CEO in the U.S. told me recently that current AI education is often too surface level, vague, unstructured, or trying to cover too much ground to be useful for a chief executive. He said, "We've been talking for a while now about how we need AI education targeting leadership, but it doesn't really exist." While destination leaders face many more questions about AI than answers, one thing is 100% clear: CEOs must own and lead their organizations' AI integration across all departments. AI isn't something to outsource or delegate to others, and it's not a "marketing thing" for the CMO to figure out. Conor Grennan , chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, consults with clients on AI strategy from JPMorgan to NASA. I asked him how important it is for CEOs to lead AI education, adoption and integration across their organizations. “CEOs have to understand how to use AI and why; they really have to have felt the delight about what AI can do,” he said. "They also have to see clearly how AI is a leadership and change management challenge, not a tech challenge. Then they need to start out being vulnerable, and be able to say, ‘Hey, I was skeptical about AI. I didn’t understand it, either. But now I can explain the way I learned it and how to communicate why it’s important to help other people understand it.” So why do CEOs need to understand AI? Jeff Bezos answered that at The New York Times DealBook Summit last year. He described how “modern AI is a horizontal enabling layer" that will soon be integrated into every device and digital application in existence. "These kind of horizontal layers like electricity and compute and now artificial intelligence, they go everywhere," he said. "I guarantee you there is not a single application that you can think of that is not going to be made better by AI." Here's the clip: Strategic AI Approaches I met with about a dozen CEOs in North America to find out what they want to know about AI specifically from a CEO perspective. Some leaders are seeking big-picture guidance with a broad overview of high-level strategy. "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” one CEO told me. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" Another chief executive said, “We see three areas of opportunity for AI: Administrative tasks and general productivity; marketing chat, SEO and data readiness; and helping customers find information about our city more effectively.… The two most important things I want to know are how to develop AI policy and how is AI changing SEO." A year ago, most CEOs had a wait-and-see attitude about AI, following how the technology evolved and what their cohorts in other organizations were doing. Today, there is a general consensus among CEOs that they need to invest in AI, but the question is how and where. One CEO told me he knows he needs to integrate AI tools and processes into his DMO, but he has three overarching questions that he wants answered first, at least at a high level: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” Other CEOs are seeking clarity on the basic fundamentals of AI: "I need to understand what are the problems that we're trying to solve with AI. What is the purpose of a chatbot, for example? What am I buying, and what can we as an organization accomplish with it?" And then others just want immediate actionable solutions: "I'm not interested in hypotheticals. Show me five ways I can implement AI on Monday. Give me turnkey AI solutions that work today." AI Data is King Personalized data is one of generative AI’s biggest value propositions. Conversational AI (chat) is the new marketplace, and it’s eating the entire funnel including in-destination engagement. In some cities, AI chat conversations between DMOs and visitors is exceeding 25% in-destination, giving DMOs a way to influence visitor behavior in real time. Also, in some industry segments like tours and activities, in-chat conversations are driving in-destination bookings with partners like GetYourGuide. Everyone is looking for first/zero-party data around that. “We have a low level of proprietary data about who is in our destination and what they’re doing,” asserted one CEO. “We have a few disparate data sources, but we need to connect those, and we want to be able to use it predictively. For example, we're looking at regression analysis to help develop future scenario modeling, and we're looking at AI to help us with that." Another CEO said, “We need data that provides material value for our partners. That’s our mandate. How are our visitors spending money and where? How are they behaving and traveling through our area? How can we help people find our partners in a more personalized way?” And one CEO added, "A key priority for us is figuring out the data equation so outbound messaging can be tailored to a 1-on-1 relationship.” Striving for that direct individual customer engagement has been the holy grail for marketers for decades. The ability to deliver mass personalization at scale is now coming into focus with enhanced AI data curation. National organizations like Destination Canada and Germany Travel have invested millions of dollars in data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to restructure their tourism product data from scratch, capitalize on the data more effectively to rank higher in AI search, and drive incremental revenue to partners. That's what the future looks like. For more information, check out the new Canadian Tourism Data Collective and Germany's Open Data Project . Today, local tourism organizations are starting to see how data structure and content architecture are strategic imperatives for them, too. One municipal CEO explained, "I think it might almost be too early to have this conversation in some areas until AI matures more. One thing I am eager to know now is how do we develop a data lake to structure our own data and messaging to make it easier for AI search tools to find." AI search and SEO are a huge conversation today. During the past year, the #1 question I heard while speaking about AI with dozens of North American destination organizations, their boards and key industry/community stakeholders, was: How do we rank higher in AI search? What happens when AI buries organic content? What’s going to happen to our websites? Are they going to disappear? Is a DMO without a website still a DMO? How do we need to produce content differently? And, what the heck is a data lake? One CEO I spoke with is planning on developing a new website for her organization. She said, "I don't even know what I don't know about AI search, but we need to figure some of that out before we start spending any money." Along with data, defining KPIs for AI integration is a hot topic of debate, and presently there isn’t a complete and codified list of metrics that DMO leaders agree on. That said, perhaps the travel and tourism industry collectively needs to understand what AI is, and what it can accomplish at scale, before attaching too many metrics to it. A CMO told me at DI MarCom Summit this month, “People didn’t ask about ROI with the internet when it first came around. We just knew we had to have it,” because it was a new channel for reaching visitors. Same as AI now. Expanding on that, he suggested that DMOs need to break AI success tracking into awareness metrics and performance metrics, and get that conversation right before anything else. Staff AI Adoption Unlike previous technology evolutions, there doesn’t seem to be as much of a generational divide between early adopters of AI and everyone else. The industry can’t look to Gen Z for guidance about how to use AI to the same degree we once asked Millennials for insights about Instagram. Again, driving AI adoption across an organization begins with the CEO. Once that’s established, the real challenge is convincing department leaders and staff to lean into AI. It's a challenge because there is widespread concern, skepticism and/or suspicion among many staff members across many industries that they’re being asked to learn new technologies that will eventually replace them. Leadership should say to employees that no one can force them to use AI, but the job market will. The data is clear. According to the Linkedin/Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index : 79% of leaders agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with Al skills than a more experienced one without 66% of leaders won’t hire someone without AI skills 60% of leaders worry their organization lacks a plan and vision to implement AI And that's a year old. But, understandably, emphasizing those numbers comes across as threatening. A better strategy for driving AI adoption is finding staff members who are already seeing success with AI, supporting them with access to education and pro AI models, and working out from there. The more employees see their colleagues using AI, the more some of them feel inclined to lean in. Therefore, every DMO needs a comprehensive strategic AI road map that includes purpose, policy, education, integration and a continuous feedback loop across all levels of staff. CEOs need to create a space for that. "We're giving our staff time to play around with AI, but they have to present what they're focusing on and what they're learning to their individual supervisor," a CEO told me. Another added, “We're focusing on staff adoption. But I need you to explain to me what works, how to implement, and what should I watch out for." I'm presently working with our departments at Matador Network to explore a bunch of various AI models to optimize workflows, boost creativity, enhance strategic planning, diversify product, etc. There's a well-communicated mandate from the top that Matador will become an AI-first company, and sooner than later. To help accelerate that, we created an AI task force to bring more perspectives from across the company together to integrate AI into operations. That has been valuable with some immediate takeaways, such as staff is now reaching out and asking for assistance with AI. But it's only a start. "There's this idea that if you can get a core group of people using AI then their attitudes and behaviors will spread organically throughout the rest of the company," said Conor Grennan at NYU. "It doesn't work that way. You have to find the people who have fears about AI and listen to them to understand why. You have to say, 'Yes, AI does suck at that, but here's what it's good at.' You also need to weed out the negative people who are against AI outright. They're dangerous." 5 Key Takeaways Let's go back to that first CEO who wants to know the five big questions about AI. Based on the input from the above CEOs, here's a first stab at that: How can I create AI policy that serves our organization but doesn't suppress experimentation among staff? (Interestingly, policy did not come up that much with the CEOs I spoke with.) How do we need to develop our websites, content and data to rank higher in AI search? How is AI SEO different, and the same, as old SEO? What are existing AI chat platforms accomplishing, how are visitors using them, and how are they influencing travel decision making and purchase behavior? If AI is not just for marketing, what does the ecosystem of AI tools for all departments look like across the organization? And what do they do in terms of increasing productivity, creativity and quality? How do I get staff to buy in? We know AI is an imperative for our organization's competitive advantage and relevance. And we know AI is an imperative for employees for their professional growth and marketability. But how do we get our people to really believe in the need to embrace AI? Greg Oates

CONTENT:
Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Royce Chwin, president and CEO of Destination Vancouver , personifies how a DMO chief executive needs to establish and articulate the mandate for integrating AI across the organization. That was the topic of our last Destination AI post where 12 CEOs explained: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . Early in 2024, Chwin addressed the full staff in Destination Vancouver’s office before a session I was presenting there on AI. “We cannot not do this,” he said, stating that the organization needed to adopt AI processes to stay relevant in the industry and increase its value in the community. If Destination Vancouver is positioning itself as an innovative DMO, he explained, then the road ahead with AI was clear. Since then, Destination Vancouver launched a new website fully integrated with AI where visitors can customize how they find travel information. The build was a two-year process requiring an inordinate amount of learning to capitalize on generative AI. The team also developed an AI policy guide that Chwin shared for this post. The comprehensive document is designed to "provide clear protocols that maximize and encourage the use of Al tools where appropriate and safe to do so, while minimizing any potential risks and concerns." The policy guide encourages staff to use AI for "enhancing productivity, efficiency, creativity or decision-making." It defines when not to use AI models and how staff is required to review and validate all AI outputs for accuracy and bias. Also, Stefan Hawes, vp of global marketing, initiated the development of an internal AI Council, bringing together a diverse group of staff to coordinate AI processes across the organization. Chwin shared an internal briefing report outlining the purpose of the Council as follows: It is recommended that an AI Council be established immediately to provide a centralized body for managing AI-related initiatives and to expand training opportunities for team members. The Council will focus on: Setting strategic priorities related to AI Selecting use cases, implementing projects/initiatives/AI software purchases and evaluating their effectiveness Developing a data strategy to support AI adoption and initiatives Developing an AI education, literacy and adoption program Ensuring ethical compliance Fostering cross-departmental collaboration to maximize the impact of AI projects We created a similar AI task force at Matador, and the value of that cannot be overstated to better assess how staff from different departments perceive, and misperceive, AI in general. I talked with Chwin this week to better understand how a DMO CEO can best lead strategic AI implementation across his or her organization. The purpose of this post is to help inform, inspire and influence other CEOs to consider the opportunities of AI in a new light. Greg Oates: Royce, you've been a strident proponent of AI for a couple years now, and yet there are many other CEOs who are still reticent. How did you personally come to decide Destination Vancouver needed to embrace AI? Royce Chwin: The perception still of some DMOs is that we are behind when it comes to technology. We're slow to adapt. We're slow to evolve. You see all these other organizations in the travel sphere around us that are able to move much quicker. They might be capitalized better. They can adjust. They can pivot quicker to take on these new technologies, and they can experiment seemingly without the degree of fear or consternation that maybe some DMOs have. So, I think there's lots of different reasons. For us, I mean, it's day and night. We can't not do that. Our entire ecosystem that we play in has some level of AI being used. Number one is our customers. They’re using AI. So it goes back to that same idea that you and I have discussed many times before: How do we as a DMO stay relevant and how do we show value? AI is a response to answering those two things. GO: In many organizations today, there’s often skepticism and suspicion among staff about how AI might take their jobs, or they’re dismissive of AI altogether. How does your team feel about AI overall? RC: I'm not finding a fear in our organization for using AI. I think it's a different set of challenges. I think there are so many derivatives of AI out there that people don't know what to focus on. Because you can’t and don't need to focus on 40 different AI tools. The question is, what are the best tools that are most relevant to the work that I need to do? That, I think, in my experience is a bigger challenge. My sense of it is that AI can be so overwhelming. It can seem unbelievably complicated. So we had to ask ourselves, do we have the time, resources and skill sets to simply understand it? Secondly, are we asking better questions to understand what in the organization we need to solve, and can AI help? GO: In a previous post, I shared input from 12 DMO CEOs about how they feel about AI. What are you hearing from other CEOs? RC: I was over in Europe recently for Destinations International’s Global Leaders Forum where I was onstage with Sherrif Karamat (CEO of PCMA) and Petra Stušek (CEO at Ljubljana Tourism). We were talking about the importance of face-to-face meetings and so on, and Sherrif made a comment that DMOs are really behind using AI. It was kind of a blanket statement, and he's not wrong. But, I said to Sheriff that I think a lot of DMOs are behind because it's like throwing confetti in somebody's face and asking them to pick the best pieces. They don't even know what they're trying to evaluate, and it’s also moving so fast. In the meantime, our customers are running around us using AI for all kinds of things. And so I think that there's not so much a fear of using AI. It’s more that people are questioning how to respond to the increasing emergence of AI because they’re thinking, “I'm not really 100% clear on the business problem I'm trying to solve that supports my mandate.” For us, and you saw it when you visited, we were really clear on what it is that we needed to do. We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI. “We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI.” GO: I’ve been asserting that CEOs should own and lead AI adoption in their organizations to have the best chance for success. I don't mean lead it day to day. I mean the chief executive must establish the mandate that AI is something the organization is going to invest in, and articulate why and how to the entire staff. Connor Grennan, chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, emphasized to me that’s the only way this works. Do you agree? RC: Yes, I absolutely believe it must come from the CEO because the CEO has to clear the vision with the team. And with something as seismic as AI, and how it’s evolving in our daily life, in our world, I think the CEO has a responsibility to address it and how it will impact the organization. Everyone needs to understand how we’re going to use AI in alignment with our mission and strategic goals, and how it will support the mandate. That's all CEO level. That's the responsibility on my head. Also, I can't imagine going in front of my Board and asking, “Hey, what are you doing with AI? What should we do with AI?” So it has to come from the CEO, but my Board has also enabled me. Like, there's no grief from my Board. Zero. We are fully enabled. GO: You've created the necessary structure to help govern AI integration with your AI Policy and AI Council. Can you expand on the thinking behind those? RC: We developed an AI policy that’s designed to enable people to use AI and not discourage them from experimenting. Obviously, some education is required in terms of proprietary information and those kinds of things. But we're really leaning into this and we're going to assign some time for it to enable the organization to experiment and play with AI without fear of reprisal. Naturally there needs to be governance around it, but governance does not mean stopping creativity. Governance means we’re creating and delivering new opportunities for creativity. There just needs to be structure around that. Also, Stefan came up with the idea of pulling together an AI Council in the organization, which I think is fantastic. We're getting individuals from each business line, including myself, and we’re going to talk about AI, its impacts, what we need to be thinking about, and how we'll improve our website and the organization as a whole. So we're creating dialogue around it to define opportunities. For example, I'm really excited about AI as it relates to all the country market analysis that we do. We've been doing that by spreadsheet, but now we’re exploring AI to provide the insights we need to inform our market planning more effectively. There are lots of different examples like that, but you only discover them by being open to experimenting with AI. Greg Oates

Toronto & Denver Tourism Leaders on the 5 Big AI Questions for CEOs Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates A year from now, the travel and tourism sector might look back and thank Andrew Weir, president and CEO of Destination Toronto , for catalyzing how DMOs move forward with AI. At PCMA Convening Leaders in January this year, I asked Weir what CEOs need to understand about AI at a high level. Numerous other CEOs have told me there’s a complete lack of AI education specifically designed for DMO chief executives. His answer was first shared anonymously in our previous post, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” said Weir. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" At the end of that post I suggested what those five questions might be based on all the CEO insights in there, and I've since been shopping them around to vet them. A few weeks ago, for example, Richard Scharf, president and CEO at Visit Denver , suggested restructuring the questions to create a more logical hierarchy. Now, the first three deal with internal operations while the last two identify external, visitor-facing priorities. Yesterday, I spoke again with Weir, as well as Paula Port, vice president of marketing at Destination Toronto, for their input on the five questions. The goal here is to provide clear structure around AI platforms and processes for DMOs leading up to Matador Network’s collaboration with U.S. Travel at ESTO in Phoenix this fall. Together, we’ll be co-hosting an interactive, multi-station “AI Playground” educational activation during the three days of the conference. Here are the five big AI questions. These will evolve but now we have a foundation to begin building consensus on how DMOs can capitalize on opportunities and navigate challenges with AI today. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The 5 Big AI Questions 1. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? A growing number of DMO leaders say their teams embrace AI for the most part, and many are actively developing basic AI strategy. That’s a significant shift from a year ago. At the same time, there's still varying degrees of cynicism and skepticism about AI in other organizations. I asked Weir about his staff. “I don't feel like we're dragging the team into this,” he said. “It's really more a matter of how people are at such different places with AI. So our goal is figuring out how to channel all their knowledge and energy, and kind of align and unify that, without stifling anyone’s creativity.” Scharf at Visit Denver emphasized that this question should be the first one, because successful AI integration begins with understanding your staff’s grasp of AI and their appetite for leaning into it. “ChatGPT is growing like Zoom did a few years ago so we know we need to use it,” he said. “The first thing we did was survey staff to assess how they feel about AI, and how or if they’re using it. Then we started off with small bites like email. Now we think of AI as a toolkit, and we're continuing to explore what tools are appropriate for different needs.” Port added that AI integration across teams works best with both structured and self-directed learning. “We started by making everything (ChatGPT Plus, Google Gemini) available to everyone, so they were given access to tools and resources, but a lot of this is really self-directed learning,” she said. “What we're seeing now is people have taken advantage of that and moved forward with it. Some maybe a little bit further than others, so maybe we need to address that. I think we still need more use cases and more structured learning because we're not all at the same level in terms of knowing and understanding how to put AI to use.” 2. How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? Destination Toronto was one of the first North American municipal DMOs to develop an AI policy. They began the process by pulling examples from larger government-operated tourism organizations including Destination Canada and Destination British Columbia. “We set up that policy structure first in terms of what we wanted as an organization, and also being very clear that any use of AI was meant to drive business results,” said Weir. “I think we were able to get there pretty quickly because we didn't create a series of regulations. We built a series of philosophies and principles to guide where we go. It was meant to put guardrails around protecting information, while at the same time, stimulate learning and sharing. Because we said to the team that you are free and encouraged to use AI, but there is an expectation that you will share what you've learned.” Port explained further that, “We leveraged existing processes already in place from a content perspective in terms of bias, IT usage, etc. We have an assessment process for any sort of software application that we're looking to use, so we did the same with AI.” (Note: The next GuideGeek Destination AI post will be with Kara Franker, president and CEO of Visit Florida Keys, who is also an attorney. We discussed AI policy at length.) 3. How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? Scharf stated that integrating AI platforms and processes beyond marketing is “where all the work is happening now.” His organization is switching out regular stand up meetings with extended AI workshops and visiting speakers to learn more about AI tools for various use cases across departments. Leadership, he said, including himself, are present at these meetings so everyone is learning together. Weir and Port both addressed this question, saying they need to first explore how Simpleview, Cvent and other tech partners are integrating AI functionality before looking at any new AI platforms. We discussed PCMA’s Project Spark , an AI-native event development tool that includes the new Destinaitor destination sourcing platform. DMO leadership and sales teams are exploring Spark to understand how clients are using new AI software to evaluate, compare and source destinations for business events. Others, like Kara Franker mentioned above, are looking for new AI solutions to optimize their HR and accounting departments, but she said many of the available options presently are only enterprise grade. Something DMOs should really look at, and I’m not sure how/if many already are, but there is proven value in creating custom GPTs for sales teams. GPTs are like mini ChatGPTs designed for specific purposes that anyone with a ChatGPT Plus account can create. For example, a sales rep can build a knowledge base inside a GPT by uploading sales materials, examples of successful bids, product information, pricing, team members, case studies, testimonials and other data. The next step is to develop internal GPT instructions to direct what the GPT does and what it prioritizes. Following that, the rep can then chat with the GPT and ask it to create a customized bid for a potential client that pulls all relevant source materials from the knowledge base that best supports the pitch. I’m imagining the ability to create custom GPTs is going to soon be a standard and required capability for all sales teams. One of the earliest enterprise examples of this was Salesforce’s Einstein GPT, which has since morphed into Agentforce. We use them at Matador because of improved efficiency and quality. GPTs also provide a new option for creative brainstorming, which some salespeople appreciate who don't identify as being super creative. Increases in sales production can be clearly identified. However, there's increasing conversation about tracking success in other departments. When AI delivers clear improvements in efficiency and saves people significant time, how do you measure that? One concern is that people will then just work a six hour day versus eight hours. The common thinking is that organizations will need to adjust productivity benchmarks, but this is a messy conversation. I don’t know enough to comment on that yet, but I wanted to put a pin in it because it’s something we’ll all need to look at eventually as AI scales in the workforce. 4. How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? I was addressing Visit Denver’s Board a while back and one member suggested that DMOs won’t need websites soon because they’ll be replaced by a ChatGPT-like window. I’m surprised by how much this comes up. For one thing, DMOs will always need some kind of online knowledge base for AI search queries. If anything, that will require more content and more comprehensive product information because AI search thrives more than anything on data structure, clarity and specificity. That said, the web user interface will likely evolve considerably. Expect to hear a lot more about how DMOs are developing data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to optimize data structure for AI search. For further context, here's a Perplexity Pro response to the question: "Are tourism boards developing data lakes and warehouses to optimize their sites for AI search?" Weir suggested that this conversation about the future of websites is not unlike what we went through 15 years ago, when people were lamenting the death of DMO sites because social media was deemed by some as the new web. More important, he asserted, is seeing how AI search is evolving and being prepared to adapt strategy. “I think there is a push-pull here between how we lead and where customers are at,” said Weir. “We want to deliver more information through our AI assistant and AI search in general, but customers aren't really there yet. I don't know what the percentage is, but the majority of people are still using Google. They're still beginning an interaction on the web by entering search terms in Google the traditional way. At some point, that's going to flip, right? It's going to be a few percent more each month or quarter, whatever that is. But how far ahead of it do we get? And how do we calibrate? We can try to lead on this, but you know, we also have to stay in step with where our customers are too.” 5. How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? Chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI have dashboards that clearly identify what visitors are asking about in the destination. That helps inform content and product development strategy, and the data is valuable for community engagement. AI chat platforms also operate 24/7 in 50+ languages, which helps DMO influence in-destination travel and spending for a much wider audience than ever before. How to best capitalize on conversational AI, and ultimately conversational commerce, is an evolving topic because we’re still in the early days where travelers are learning they can search with large language models and trust them. ChatGPT has 400 million weekly users but ChatGPT only added full functioning search capability for all users a few months ago. Consumers are just beginning to understand that they can now “talk” to a city. To help accelerate understanding and adoption of AI chat among visitors, Port asserted that the onus is on DMOs to promote their AI chat robustly like any other channel. Weir did that recently by highlighting Destination Toronto’s GuideGeek-powered “6ix” chat platform on LinkedIn, asking, “Ever had a chat directly with a city?” Weir was specifically promoting the organization’s WhatsApp platform, where people can now have a highly personalized, iterative conversation directly with Destination Toronto via the GuideGeek AI integration. The same functionality exists with the other Meta platforms, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. A few hours after Weir's post I received a Slack message from our CTO Stefan Klopp wondering what was going on in Toronto. WhatsApp volume was spiking, he said, and he was asking if Toronto had sent out a press release promoting 6ix, or something. No, it was just a quick CEO social media post. Also, Tourism New Zealand just launched a new campaign in collaboration with “A Minecraft Movie” that integrates GuideGeek-powered prompt questions to trigger further engagement. So, those are just a couple examples of how DMO/NTOs can drive AI chat engagement. The question for Weir and Port though is about the types of questions people are asking in AI chat platforms. Presently, a lot of the chat conversations are more utilitarian, related to queries about hotels, restaurants, attractions, events, directions, etc. So as conversational AI adoption increases, will DMOs focus more on developing content that answers those basic types of questions, like what hotel, restaurant or attraction is highly rated, and how to get there. Or, should DMOs continue to focus mainly on developing what is generally perceived as more inspirational destination and experiential content? "The question then becomes about responding to inquiries versus the inspirational side," explained Port. "Like, all of these articles, all of this content that we serve up, that is not in response to a question per se. It's more packaged to inspire people. I think a lot of that's going to have to exist outside our environments, maybe, whether it's influencers, it's your earned media strategy, it's content partnerships, things like that. That's where I think the inspiration will exist. But we really have to move to being more of the informative one, on our website or whatever a website is. But it needs to be very specific in answering questions. We already see that on GuideGeek." Weir summed up, saying, "I think this ends up relating more to, again, that question of where the customers are. Are we putting ourselves in a position to answer their questions and deliver the information in the way they're looking for it, using AI and the data lake approach? Or, are we curators like we've always been, inspiring visitors with local experiences, or is the customer now the curator by virtue of how they're asking questions today?" Summary These five takeaways are aligned with the five big AI questions. AI adoption begins with talking to DMO staff to understand what the organization is working with. Love the idea about marrying structured and self-directed learning, and being intentional about that with staff. At some point, for AI adoption to scale and continually evolve on an ongoing basis, there needs to be AI leaders in any organization who pick up the torch and inspire their colleagues to lean into AI. Otherwise, things tend to plateau with the same people using the same AI models. AI policy is intended to encourage staff to innovate with AI as much as it's meant to protect organizations. AI is the death of "I don't know," so it can benefit all staff in all departments. That in itself is enough ROI to validate initial investments in AI. The tools can provide a foundation of knowledge and direction for problem solving and strategic planning exponentially better than traditional search. Some organizations, like Visit Greece who we work with, have phenomenal website data structure ideally optimized for AI search. Meanwhile, one CEO told me "Our website is a mess with outdated content and poor data structure. We need to rebuild from scratch with AI search top of mind." Chat is the new marketplace, and AI is eating the entire funnel including in-destination. Moreover, AI chat data provides DMO leaders with insights into what visitors are asking about. Although, I think as chat adoption scales mainstream, the conversations will evolve beyond asking for a good hotel or restaurant. Greg Oates

Why Small Steps With AI Create Big Wins for Tourism Organizations Sep 22 Written By Greg Oates Key Theme: How to Align Strategic Risk Management and Progressive AI Implementation The rush to transform everything with AI has dominated boardroom discussions since ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Yet the most successful organizations aren't pursuing wholesale AI overhauls. They're taking calculated, incremental steps that deliver real value while building capabilities for the future. MIT researchers interviewed senior managers at 21 large companies actively using generative AI. Their findings challenge the prevailing narrative about AI transformation. Companies are deliberately choosing "small t" transformations over risky, large-scale implementations. This approach works particularly well for tourism organizations where customer trust and regulatory compliance matter deeply. Tourism organizations face unique challenges with AI adoption. Customer data privacy concerns run high. Regulatory requirements vary across jurisdictions. Service quality directly impacts reputation. The research reveals that successful companies treat AI implementation like climbing a risk slope. They start with low-risk internal applications before moving to customer-facing solutions. This measured approach isn't about being timid. It's about being smart. Tourism CEOs can build organizational confidence, develop necessary skills, and demonstrate tangible value before tackling more complex implementations. Start With Universal Productivity Tools That Employees Already Want to Use The research uncovered a surprising reality. Employees were already using ChatGPT and other public AI tools without permission. Companies responded by providing secure, private versions of these tools. This grassroots adoption pattern offers tourism organizations a clear starting point. Consider how your marketing team writes destination descriptions. Your operations staff creates training materials. Your finance team prepares reports. These tasks consume hours of employee time across every department. Private AI instances from providers like ChatGPT or Claude eliminate security concerns while boosting productivity. McKinsey built a custom platform called Lilli that connects AI to 40 internal knowledge sources. The result? Seventy-five percent employee adoption in under a year. Time savings up to 30%. Substantially improved work quality. Tourism organizations don't need to build something this sophisticated initially. Even basic AI writing assistants can transform daily work. Microsoft Copilot integration takes this further. Employees can search across company documents instantly. They can pull content from emails, meeting transcripts, and presentations. One manager described it as having "a super search engine" for company information. Imagine your team finding that obscure policy document from three years ago in seconds rather than hours. The beauty of starting here? Minimal risk. Maximum adoption. Employees want these tools. They're probably already using consumer versions. Providing enterprise versions addresses security concerns while meeting existing demand. Your IT team maintains control. Your employees get productivity gains. Everyone wins. Some employees will still seek external tools for specific needs. One product manager uses Midjourney for quick visuals. Another uses voice-to-text tools for performance reviews. Accept this reality. Focus on providing core tools internally while establishing clear guidelines for external tool usage. Deploy AI for Specific Roles While Keeping Humans in Control Once basic AI tools gain traction, tourism organizations can target specific job functions. The key insight from the research? Maintain human oversight for quality control. This "human in the loop" approach reduces risk while capturing efficiency gains. Customer service represents an ideal starting point for tourism organizations. AI can help agents find information quickly. It can suggest responses in real time. It can analyze call patterns to identify coaching opportunities. MIT researchers found AI coaching tools increased call center productivity by 14% on average. New and low-skilled workers improved by 34%. Morgan Stanley equipped financial advisors with an AI assistant trained on over one million internal documents. The tool doesn't replace advisors. It helps them find information faster so they can focus on customer relationships. Tourism organizations can apply this same principle. Help your concierge staff access local recommendations instantly. Enable tour guides to answer obscure historical questions accurately. Support reservation agents with instant access to availability across properties. CarMax demonstrates another powerful application. The company uses AI to generate descriptions for over 5,000 car pages. Manual creation would take multiple humans 11 years. With AI, it takes hours. The 80% approval rate from editorial review proves quality doesn't suffer. Tourism organizations can apply this to property descriptions, tour summaries, and destination guides. Creative teams at Dentsu use AI throughout their workflow. From proposals to budgeting to ideation. The emerging technology director noted employees spend less time on mundane tasks. They create higher-quality content with less effort. Tourism marketing teams can similarly accelerate campaign development, social media content creation, and promotional material design. Finance departments traditionally resist new technology. Yet some organizations successfully use AI for audit reports, regulatory compliance, and fraud detection. Amazon's finance team reports employees shifted from repetitive tasks to critical thinking work. Tourism organizations can start with expense report processing or invoice matching before tackling complex financial analysis. Transform Customer Experiences Gradually With Clear Boundaries Customer-facing AI sits highest on the risk slope. Yet the potential rewards justify careful exploration. The research shows companies succeeding by setting clear boundaries and expanding gradually. Chatbots evolved from frustrating phone trees to sophisticated conversational agents. John Hancock's insurance chatbots handle common queries effectively. Human agents focus on complex issues. Starbucks, Domino's, and CVS expanded to voice interactions. Video interactions come next. Tourism organizations can start with FAQ chatbots on their websites. Add booking assistance once that works well. Expand to voice-based concierge services when ready. Personalization transforms online shopping experiences. Tapestry, parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, uses real-time language modifications. The conversational tone mimics in-store associates. Revenue increased at least 3%. Tourism organizations can personalize trip recommendations based on past bookings. Adjust website content for different traveler segments. Customize email campaigns for individual preferences. Software companies already embed AI throughout their products. Adobe users create and modify images effortlessly. Canva simplifies presentation creation. Lucidchart converts text descriptions into flowcharts. Tourism organizations benefit as their existing software vendors add AI features. Property management systems will suggest optimal pricing. Booking platforms will predict cancellation risks. Marketing tools will automate campaign optimization. The key? Start small. Test thoroughly. Expand gradually. A failed internal productivity tool frustrates employees. A failed customer-facing AI damages your brand. Move up the risk slope deliberately. Build Foundational Capabilities Before Attempting Major Transformations The research revealed an uncomfortable truth. Scaling AI from pilot to production is harder than expected. Data quality issues multiply. Edge cases appear more frequently. Integration challenges compound. Many organizations discovered they needed stronger foundations before pursuing ambitious AI projects. CarMax's chief information officer emphasized data quality. "Good data will give you good results from AI." Poor data produces unreliable outputs. Tourism organizations must audit their data systems. Customer records across multiple systems need reconciliation. Historical booking data requires cleaning. Property information needs standardization. Governance structures matter equally. Who approves AI projects? How do you measure success? What happens when AI makes mistakes? Establish these frameworks before scaling implementations. Small pilots can proceed without perfect governance. Enterprise deployments cannot. Capital One's chief scientist warned against the "gold-rush mentality." Thoughtful, responsible implementation beats rushed deployment. Build the scaffolding to bring everyone along. Tourism organizations should resist pressure to match competitors' AI announcements. Focus on sustainable progress over headlines. Management buy-in proves essential for larger projects. One technology company's AI efforts stagnated until the CEO personally championed them. Small wins build credibility for bigger investments. Document productivity gains from initial deployments. Share customer satisfaction improvements. Make the business case concrete before requesting major funding. Summary: Small Transformations Today Enable Big Transformations Tomorrow The research delivers a clear message for tourism CEOs. Successful AI implementation doesn't require revolutionary change. It requires evolutionary progress. Start with universal productivity tools that employees already want. Target specific roles with human oversight. Transform customer experiences within careful boundaries. Build foundational capabilities systematically. This approach particularly suits tourism organizations. Your business depends on human connections. Technology should enhance these connections, not replace them. Your customers value authentic experiences. AI should enable better experiences, not artificial ones. Your reputation takes years to build and moments to destroy. Measured AI deployment protects what you've built while enabling future growth. The companies studied aren't waiting for perfect AI solutions. They're using today's technology to solve real problems while preparing for tomorrow's possibilities. They're training employees, cleaning data, and establishing governance. When breakthrough AI capabilities arrive, they'll be ready to capitalize quickly. Tourism organizations can follow this same path. Deploy AI writing assistants next month. Add customer service chatbots next quarter. Enhance personalization next year. Each step builds on the last. Each success enables the next. Small transformations compound into competitive advantage. The AI transformation race isn't won by the fastest starter. It's won by consistent, strategic progress. Tourism CEOs who embrace "small t" transformation today position their organizations for "big T" transformation tomorrow. The journey starts with a single step up the risk slope. Greg Oates

How to Develop AI Strategy for Your Organization Oct 12 Written By Greg Oates The 2050 City AI Roadmap provides a high-level strategic framework for how DMOs and other organizations can capitalize on AI to optimize internal operations, resources and knowledge, and ultimately, drive partner revenue. DMOs have all kinds of strategic plans, master plans, business and marketing plans, etc. The 2050 City AI Roadmap outlines the process to develop your AI strategic plan. It defines the big picture outlook for AI as the future of commerce, and it proposes a methodology to help DMO leaders prioritize, organize and navigate how they go about integrating AI across their organization. Presently, we're rolling this out with Visit Mesa , Tourism Richmond in British Columbia, and The Florida Keys & Key West . The three CEOs for those organizations have all agreed to share takeaways and business outcomes with each others' teams to cross-pollinate learning and accelerate AI process integration. That spirit of knowledge sharing and co-learning for me is huge, because we as an industry are all pretty much flying blindly with AI from a macro perspective. Yes, we've come a long way in the last year. Every DMO CEO I talk to these days is now implementing various AI processes and seeing value. However, we're all kind of flying this plane while we're building it at the same time, and we don't really have a destination, or even due north, in mind. The 2050 City AI Roadmap was designed to identify where we're going with this emergent technology that's both incredibly powerful and often highly unpredictable. It also defines how high-end AI chat platforms, like Matador Network's GuideGeek AI , are the tip of the spear for agentic commerce. The following guidelines are based on experience in the workplace to deliver new value with AI for your team, board, industry partners and community stakeholders. Internal & External Direction Every decision related to AI strategy should first be defined through an internal or external lens. Your board members will typically view internal workplace optimization as tactical. Externally, AI integrations that are consumer-facing and revenue generating are usually perceived as more strategic. Internal Facing From an internal standpoint, the focus of the AI Roadmap is on optimizing operations to take advantage of an organization's aggregate of resources and knowledge. Imagine the totality of insights across every team member in terms of their expertise and networks in their communities. AI systems are designed to pool and capitalize on that, but only if an organization's knowledge base is structured intelligently. That means rebuilding your folder structures and files naming conventions so an AI can find everything. According to Slack, workers spend 41% of their time on menial tasks, including endless hours just looking for information. The overall losses related to productivity, quality of work and workplace, and physical/mental health are crazy. So let's start there with AI strategy to address our internal digital dumpster fire. External Facing Externally, from a marketing, sales and visitor/partner engagement perspective, AI strategy begins with integrating a robust AI chat platform like GuideGeek. DMOs have never really had proprietary information on who their visitors are. They have geo-location, credit card spend, event attendance data, etc., which show visitor behavior. But none of those really identify visitor motivations and mindsets indepth. With an AI chat platform, DMOs can now pull analytics showing what visitors are actually asking and what they want to know on an individual and aggregate basis. We launched our new GuideGeek V2 analytics dashboard this past week, which provides deeper, fuller insights into visitor psychographics. That data then informs all kinds of resource allocation decisions related to content development, AI SEO strategy, data analysis, product and destination development, community engagement, etc. CEO Roles AI is best defined as a new digital "co-intelligence" that can communicate, reason and create for the first time ever, versus just another new technology. We emphasize that AI is really a new environment for collaboration more than anything, just not solely among humans anymore. Learning AI is not like learning Photoshop. You can only "teach" AI up to a point, like trying to teach someone how to ride a bike. You can't teach a child how to stay on two wheels without falling in a classroom. He or she actually has to start pedaling, and eventually the child's mind and body basically have a conversation, so to speak, with the bike to grasp the fundamentals of moving forward successfully. Same with AI. The only way to learn AI is to use AI. Helping human teams embrace this new co-intelligence (and it's not like there's a choice) falls under the umbrella of change management. That's a CEO's wheelhouse. It will take more than a few years for many humans to reconcile their minds and values with this new relationship, and it falls on the CEO's shoulders to steward that reconciliation. Likewise, CEOs oversee AI governance, policy and privacy. I've shared before how AI governance should be viewed less like a car brake and more like a steering wheel to inform, direct and accelerate AI adoption and integration. Lastly, only CEOs can scale long-term AI benefits and business outcomes effectively. You can't really delegate this. AI efforts will plateau at times, some or many AI experimentations will fail, and there are always staff members who will drag their feet because they just don't like AI. DMO CEOs are chief people officers and it's on them to create the right culture for scaling AI platforms and processes effectively for everyone in their crews. Agentic AI This is where things get interesting. AI agents and agentic commerce might sound super confusing for many or most staff members. Lots of land mines to watch out for, sure, but even more reasons for us building a macro DMO AI strategic framework. One of the key objectives for the AI Roadmap is to elevate AI agents and agentic commerce as the two interrelated cornerstones for AI strategy, and explain why. Doing so shows the true big picture value of AI, and it drives home how we eventually need to move way beyond training people the basics of prompting. Yes, it's intimidating, but we introduce the labels and contexts relating to agentic AI early on in the process. That gets some people thinking bigger about AI, and it entices the AI champions in the group to start experimenting with agents. AI Agents (Internal) For internal AI strategy, leading DMOs are developing AI agents and automated workflows to address the aforementioned 41% of time that staff members spend on grunt work and trying to find information. They are proven, they work, and most of all, they deliver measurable ROI. We're working with outside contractors at Matador to develop and implement agents and automations for both ourselves internally and for DMO clients. We are already seeing success, and there's been a recent influx among our people asking for agents. It's an amazing thing to see when staff members start requesting new AI integrations like that, proactively. That's when you know your AI strategy is working at least on some level. Agentic Commerce (External) AI agents are also the foundation for agentic commerce. According to Mastercard , "Agentic commerce is a new form of online and mobile shopping, in which an AI agent 'closes the loop' or completes tasks for a user — such as searching for items, comparing options and making a purchase — with limited or no manual inputs needed from that user. For example, while chatting in a generative AI app, you could tell the AI agent, 'Book me a nonstop flight to London for under $600 next week — no red-eyes,' and the agent will review airlines, nearby airports and your loyalty memberships and payment card rewards to identify the best option, purchase it and then share it with you." Just like with AI agents, developing agentic commerce architecture covers a wide spectrum of sophistication and capabilities. Going back to the analogy of flying a plane while building it with no clear final destination in mind, agentic commerce is the point on the map where we want to land. With GuideGeek, we have Kayak, GetYourGuide, Skyscanner and other booking tools integrated into the platform with a click-through UX/UI. Looking ahead, we're working with one national tourism organization to bring some of their national partners' booking engines (air, hotel, tour op, etc.,) into the platform to eventually convert sales in-chat. Subscribe to Mastercard Signals to keep up-to-date on agentic commerce and access intelligence like this Mastercard Payments Trends Navigator report. Staff Training & AI Integration Training staff and implementing AI processes across all departments is really the meat of the 2050 City Roadmap. But none of that should proceed without DMO leadership embracing all the above, and communicating it clearly to all staff. Easier said than done, though. Leadership needs to continually communicate a high-level approach to AI strategy, because it won't really click for many staff (or leadership) at the beginning of this process. That, of course, needs to be married with all the practical training initiatives we're continuing to develop. We've already learned a ton with the present work we're doing training DMO teams. Here are a few very basic takeaways just to start explaining our process. There are obviously many more educational modules following these, ranging from predictive analytics to specific department AI training in areas like HR, finance and legal. Conduct an internal AI survey asking all staff to share their perceptions and usage of AI. Follow that up with small group interviews across the organization, and transcribe everything with an AI notetaker. We use Granola, but there are many others. Also, explain to staff that all meetings regarding AI will be recorded to create an internal knowledge base to identify opportunities, challenges and takeaways over time. Start training with a focus on just the paid/pro models of ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. Some staff feel confused with the sheer variety of available AI tools in front of them. We explain that, at the end of the day, the basics of using AI include an end user, an AI tool, and a knowledge base. Get people on board with that, and then show how most of the AI tools they have access to are similar in many ways. One of the fastest methods to advance AI understanding is showing staff how to create custom GPTs in ChatGPT. Some team members will pick up on these quickly and start integrating them into their workflows right away. These are the people who typically make up your internal AI taskforce. Explain and show how Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot are AI workhorses that connect with the majority of people's daily workflows. However, humans tend to think of those as just the next evolution of search engines. This is mental wiring that needs to be broken. Gemini and Copilot are great/good in some ways, but I've found that training staff on just those three native LLMs first (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) is more effective for seeing the light. Google NotebookLM has a lot of fans. I like to walk teams through it because it's a good way to reinforce what a knowledge base is, like we do with the custom GPTs. Also, the automated audio and video podcasts are crowd pleasers, especially with the new Join function where users can engage directly with the agentic podcast hosts. People don't seem to want to read anymore. This was a rude awakening for us when we first launched the AI Roadmap with a series of online training materials. We now know we need to deliver short video instruction if we want anyone to actually look at the educational content. People love Descript for AI-powered video creation. Once we started showing how to use Descript, we were pleasantly surprised to see how staff really leaned in. Teaching Descript provides a fun break early in the process because people can see pretty amazing results in minutes and wrap their minds around the process fairly easily. Ask all staff to share how they're using AI effectively and where they see AI failing them. Catalogue the case studies and share across the organization to accelerate learning, inspire a healthy sense of internal competition, and track learning over time. Staff members are also often wowed seeing AI agents in action. We use n8n to develop agents, where you can create a lot of basic automated workflows quickly. Once a few early adopters see how agents can take over some of their more tedious, time-consuming tasks, others will jump in. Feedback Loop & Funding/Board Support This line in the AI Roadmap is broken down into tactical internal optimization and more strategic, consumer-facing and revenue-generating sales, marketing and stakeholder engagement. I don't have a lot to share for this section and the following one because our focus to date has been mostly on the above phases. Feedback Loop The reason we record every engagement with AI Roadmap clients is to scale learning, so if one person learns something, everyone can benefit. That will be further multiplied when we starting sharing takeaways across DMOS, and eventually the industry as a whole. Visit Mesa, Tourism Richmond and Visit Florida Keys are eager to lead this initiative, and we plan to launch a new AI thought leadership framework collectively in 2026. Funding & Board Support The spark that led to developing the AI Roadmap happened almost a year ago when a board member for a large DMO told me that she viewed AI integration as merely a tactic. If this work can elevate AI in the minds of board members toward a more high-level strategic imperative, then we'll have achieved part of our mission. There's still some work to be done first though to collect more case studies showing direct AI business outcomes before we can make a more solid case for additional funding for AI integrations. AI Strategic Plan We've produced a mockup of what we think an AI Strategic Plan will eventually look like, but it's too early to show presently. For now, we've identified three overarching pillars, each with potential strategies, action items, timelines and targets. The KPIs are crucial, of course, for scaling AI strategy across the travel industry. Right now, we're thinking the three pillars might look like the following, although this is all up in the air right now: Optimize Internal Operations & Knowledge: The strategies include cleaning up internal folders/files to improve AI outcomes in general and develop AI agents specifically. A lot in here on training, experimentation, overall adoption, success measures, etc. Increase Partner Revenue with Agentic AI: Defining how DMOs develop AI agents to fuel agentic commerce is the big goal overall with the AI Roadmap. Initial strategies in this pillar begin with more low hanging fruit though, such as website redevelopment, optimizing for AI SEO, AI chat integration, etc. Expand Community Collaboration: We're seeing more DMOs take a leading role in AI education for their industry and community stakeholders. The 2050 City Roadmap is perfectly suited for informing how DMO leaders can facilitate community AI workshops and increase the organization's overall relevance and value. Greg Oates

Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Kara Franker , president and CEO of The Florida Keys & Key West tourism organization, was among the first DMO leaders to embrace AI platforms and processes in 2023 when she was chief executive at Visit Estes Park in Colorado. In May 2024, Franker published two papers on AI strategy and policy: From the Base of the Rocky Mountains to the World: A case study through Visit Estes Park’s journey into Generative AI solutions — and how your DMO can carve its own AI path Navigating AI and the Law in the Travel Industry: An Introduction to Legal Implications for DMOs The first paper highlights how Visit Estes Park integrated GuideGeek AI chat into their website and three Meta platforms: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The DMO also branded the chat Rocky Mountain Roamer to give it an identity and bit of personality. The second paper focused on AI policy and data privacy, security and compliance. Franker, who is an attorney, co-wrote that with Roxanne Steinhoff , also an attorney at Steinhoff Law, who leads the firm’s destination marketing and sports tourism practice. I caught up with Franker to see how her perspectives on AI strategy and policy are evolving almost a year later. Greg Oates: You've been leading AI strategy in tourism for almost two years beginning with your work at Visit Estes Park. However, there’s still a lack of AI training today specific for DMO CEOs, and many leaders are presently unsure how to proceed with AI. As a CEO, what’s your take on that? Kara Franker: I'm not surprised that there's a lack of training because there's just so much for everybody to wrap their heads around. I think some people are trying to watch and wait and see. My philosophy has been more of a fall-forward, fail-forward kind of approach. That's why I put the white papers out. Anybody could learn from what we had done, and do it better. You know, a case study is sometimes the best way to figure this stuff out, so that's why we did it. The second paper on AI policy was with Roxanne Steinhoff on the legal and ethical implications of AI. Because when I would go and speak in front of groups, those were always the big questions from the leadership. They don't know how far is too far once you open this can of worms. That's why we got together and started to put guardrails in place that we thought might make sense for people to study, just as a first stab at it. That all launched last summer, so I do think that there's a little bit of education out there but we could definitely use more. GO: What do DMOs need to know about AI policy at a very high level in terms of privacy and security? KF: Employee and client information should be kept private and not uploaded into any AI tools. That could be a big deal, thinking of all the different rules and regulations about collecting information, especially how it's more stringent in Europe than in the United States. That can cause potential problems if you're uploading, say, a client list that has personal cell phones, email addresses or other information that people just don't want out there. So, it's really more about information that's attached to a person. And then, is there competitive data that you don't necessarily want others to have? Possibly, but so much of what we do in the DMO space is public anyways so the lines for that are pretty blurry. I’m trying to imagine a scenario where a DMO is, like, basically hacking somebody else's information through AI. I can’t imagine that’s worth the time and effort, or even possible. GO: A few months ago we were discussing what AI tools might be available for DMO departments like HR and accounting to help with privacy, compliance, efficiency, etc. But everything available seems to be enterprise grade and out of reach for DMOs. So what’s the answer for scaling AI across an organization? KF: I think this is a huge need. I hired somebody from Cisco who’s my new VP of technology and partnerships. She's a total AI nerd like I am, and way more qualified to dive into all this. She and I have been looking at different options to put together, almost like little plugins. We really, really need this. For example, how do we take an AI solution from the legal world to analyze all our contracts so that we don't have to spend as many hours with attorneys, because we really just need a template, right? And then for HR, same thing. How do we organize all our employee files into a much more streamlined and effective system? And then there’s our policies. We're a nonprofit but everything we do is so heavily influenced by County government. We have so many compliance issues, so I want an AI to learn every single piece of County policies so we’re able to compare and contrast what we're doing with those policies. I haven't been able to find anything to help with these things. We've looked at a lot of different options but it's like what you're saying. They're these big enterprise pieces built for law firms or financial people, and they’re all really expensive. None of them fit the mold for improving different operations at a DMO. In my mind, the marketing side is covered, especially with GuideGeek, and there are so many great options now for everything involved with marketing. So I feel like that's been tackled and done really well. But for the operations, we need more. I mean, we’ve just got to keep digging deeper, I think. GO: When you and your technology person from Cisco figure all this out, will you share what you find with the rest of us? KF: Of course, always. GO: Backing up a bit, you were arguably the very first DMO CEO to lean into AI, at least in North America, when you were with Visit Estes Park. How did you convince your board that investing in AI was important at the time, and what were some of your processes with bringing along staff? KF: We were fortunate in the sense that the board was all in and the staff were all in. And I don't mean to make age a part of it, but the staff was a little on the young side and they were all very ambitious. Everybody wanted to try to figure it out. So we made the argument to the board, if we could figure out some of what AI could do, it would make the community stronger and they could take pieces of it back to their businesses. There wasn't really anybody who was against experimenting and trying it out. We made some mistakes along the way and we put that in the white paper. Also, when we first rolled out GuideGeek, which scrapes the website, we found a few holes in our content. There were particular board members who didn't have very robust information about their business, so they got a little bit mad, but not in a, like, burn it down way. It was more of, "Oh, okay, we have some work to do." So part of the AI process has to actually be community outreach. It can't just be about the technology. We have to talk to all our partners and get really robust information from them, so when the AI crawls the site it gets the best possible information about our partners. GO: One thing you did at Visit Estes Park was brand your GuideGeek AI as Rocky Mountain Roamer on your website and three Meta platforms. We use that as a case study a lot, and emphasize that a DMO should promote their AI just like any other channel, right? KF: Definitely. We knew we had to put money behind marketing the tool if we wanted people to interact with it. Traditionally with a DMO, one of your calls to action is to send people to the website. Our new call to action for a lot of our campaigns back then was to send people to the AI, so we called it Rocky Mountain Roamer to help promote and drive traffic to it. And then in terms of KPIs, we wanted to track all the interactions you can see in the backend, but not just how many people used it. We wanted to know how long people interacted with the AI, what their journey was, and what they were asking about because that’s where things get really interesting. GO: After the initial thrill of launching GuideGeek, how did you manage how staff used AI internally? Were there any incentives involved to help spur adoption and experimentation? KF: The incentive for my team was, well, it wasn't really an incentive. It was a requirement. They had to write weekly reports for me about how they tested something with AI, whatever it was. It could apply to their job or not, I didn't really care. So I almost forced them to try AI. But then people started really getting into it. They were getting more and more user friendly with different AI tools, and they would be like, “Oh, I like Anthropic because of this or that,” because they were branching out from just using ChatGPT. So, yeah, there has to be almost like a culture of AI in your DMO for it to really work, and it's on the CEO to create and foster that. Greg Oates

Join Matador Network's AI Playground at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Matador Network, GuideGeek AI and U.S. Travel are launching the inaugural "AI Playground" at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix, August 17-19. The educational space, hands-on demo area, genius bar and live sessions will run all three days during the conference. We are also producing programming specific for travel industry CEOs, along with other sessions dedicated for senior executives, highlighting actionable AI strategies focusing on real world business outcomes. Leading up to ESTO, I'll be reaching out to many of you requesting any AI-related success stories and/or questions you might have for the AI Playground. Looking back over the last two years, it's clear the industry is turning a corner in 2025 when it comes to AI learning and adoption. Many DMOs and their industry partners are now integrating AI processes and platforms across their organizations, whereas last year many destination leaders were still in wait-and-see mode. For those of you still on the fringes, it is our ambition that the AI Playground will plant a flag in the ground showing how AI is now a proven strategy for helping DMOs further deliver on their mandate. "AI is clearly powering the future of travel and how people explore the world today," says Ross Borden, founder and CEO of Matador Network. "We are stoked to be working with U.S. Travel and investing in our industry to produce the AI Playground. AI will become standard operating procedure for every DMO soon, and we're excited to help lead this journey." DMO CEOs on AI Strategy Matador launched its proprietary GuideGeek AI chat platform for DMO websites and social media channels almost two years ago. We now have more than 40 DMOs onboard, and we're expanding the scope of GuideGeek AI with new hotel groups and tour operators joing in recent months. Based on our experience working with municipal, regional and national organizations across the global visitor industry, we have unparalleled insights into how conversational AI is changing the relationship between destinations and visitors, as well as how DMOs operate internally. In preparation for ESTO 2025, we launched this GuideGeek Destination AI newsletter in January to ramp up our industry outreach and further expand our understanding of how DMO leaders are navigating the rise of AI. Here are five stories from the newsletter that inform high-level decision making related to AI strategy, with input from more than 15 CEO DMOs: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI : Our first post with 12 DMO CEOs highlighted the wide range of questions they have. One asked for the five big AI questions he should know about. Another wants practical advice on five AI initiatives that he can implement, like, tomorrow. Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism : CEO Royce Chwin, who helms Destination Vancouver, shared why his organization was one of the first DMOs in the world to dive into AI. Destination Toronto & Visit Denver CEOs on the 5 Big AI Questions in Tourism : Two chief executives, Andrew Weir in Toronto and Richard Scharf in Denver, worked out what they believe are the five big AI themes/questions that DMOs need to focus on, as touched on in the first post. Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation : Newly installed Florida Keys CEO Kara Franker, who is also an attorney, shed light on AI policy, compliance and the need for more non-enterprise AI solutions for her organization. Visit Mesa CEO Launches New DMO AI Road Map : Another visionary DMO chief executive, Visit Mesa leader Marc Garcia is bringing a new level of structure and direction for integrating AI processes and platforms. Next up, Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau, will be discussing AI strategy from a business events perspective. I also met with Cody Chomiak, vice president of marketing at Travel Manitoba, who's really lighting a fire in Canada around AI thought leadership and adoption. He'll be sharing a few powerful AI case studies from his provincial marketing organization, both internal and visitor-facing. AI Playground at ESTO 2025 The AI Playground this year will feature three stations at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge . We will have our Matador GuideGeek team and U.S. Travel staff on hand to guide participants through the space, along with some invited AI experts from around the industry. We'll be digging into a handful of paid AI models including ChatGPT Plus/Teams, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro, Google AI Pro, Microsoft Copilot Pro and Manus. We'll show how AI is best navigated at DMOs by bucketing strategy into three unique categories: Search, Create and Sales. Specific use cases will include content generation and data analysis, AI SEO and AI-optimized web development, AI policy and governance, staff adoption, building custom GPTs for sales proposals, and automated workflows and AI agents, among others. The three stations are: The Prompt Lab welcomes all attendees to come in and test drive various AI models. The interactive, hands-on learning station will have multiple laptops for experimenting with AI tools for people of all skill levels. We'll have a bunch of paid AI models pre-loaded for live demos and one-on-one conversations showing how AI actually works and some of what it accomplishes across different departments. Feel free to bring your own laptop if you like. The Genius Bar is designed for individual and group Q&A about real world AI strategy, implementation and ROI. We'll be collecting all the questions posed to share with the broader industry afterward, so we'll have a couple crowdsourcing boards to help generate new ideas and explore new solutions. Reach out to me if you want to schedule time to talk during ESTO. The AI Theater seating area will host a range of AI-focused dialogues, micro-presentations and a few dedicated sessions designed for CEOs, as well as other senior executives. The programming schedule for all those will engagements be included in the ESTO agenda. Most importantly, all the conversations at the AI Playground will highlight tangible AI case studies and specific business outcomes. The 5 Big Questions About AI One of the best things to come out of all the interviews with DMO CEOs this year is our list of the five big AI questions that chief executives need to focus on. These questions will likely evolve a bit, but for now they're providing direction for how we're developing the AI Playground and how DMOs are moving forward with AI integration. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? I would love to hear your feedback on any the above and how we can make the ESTO 2025 AI Playground as valuable as possible for you and your teams. Reach out at greg@matadornetwork.com . Greg Oates

Visit Mesa CEO Launches New AI Roadmap Aug 25 Written By Greg Oates Visit Mesa in Arizona kicked off a new internal initiative this week to integrate AI processes and platforms across the organization. I worked with Visit Mesa to help develop their new DMO AI Roadmap, which provides a 5-phase strategic framework that most any visitor organization can use as a template. The project officially began this week during Visit Mesa’s spring board meeting to communicate why the organization is moving forward with AI to optimize the DMO’s value for Mesa’s visitor industry and the local community. Marc Garcia, CATP , president and CEO of Visit Mesa, has been eager to start this initiative. He was one of the dozen CEOs who contributed to the first GuideGeek Destination AI story a few months back, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI. For that deep dive into a CEO's mindset regarding AI, Garcia asked: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” The Visit Mesa DMO AI Roadmap answers those questions. “I've recognized that AI is extremely important not only for the world moving forward, but specifically for our industry,” Garcia explained at the beginning of this project. “We at Visit Mesa need to get out in front of it. Even as a small to medium-sized DMO with our budget, we've always taken pride in the fact that we’re typically at the forefront of the latest and greatest in terms of technology, and so this is just an extension of that.” The following is a high-level overview of the DMO AI Roadmap and each of the five phases. However, like all strategic planning, there is a big jump between developing a plan and executing it effectively. This is especially true with internal AI training. In any given organization today, there is often a wide breadth of how people perceive AI and how proficient they are with AI models. It will take time to educate and align everyone around shared benefits for the organizations and staff, expected processes, intended outcomes and success metrics. Visit Mesa AI Roadmap The DMO AI Roadmap is a structured, phased approach for educating staff and integrating AI across DMO departments. The goals for the roadmap are to optimize internal operations, enhance sales and marketing outcomes, inspire staff self-learning, future-proof the organization, and contribute to how well local industry and community leaders adopt AI best practices and benefit from them. There are two imperatives that should be established and agreed upon among leadership at the very beginning. Integrating AI processes and platforms is an imperative for the DMO to ensure its relevancy and long-term impact in the local visitor economy. If leadership doesn’t fully believe that, this strategic framework won’t work. AI proficiency is an imperative for staff members for their future growth and marketability. That said, you can’t really force people to embrace, learn and use AI intentionally, but the job market will. The following phases are highly fluid and some of the processes can be rolled out concurrently. Ultimately, these phases provide structure for effectively and responsibly implementing a new technology that has no precedent. Because of generative AI, machines can now do three things they haven’t been able to do before. They have the ability to reason, the ability to communicate, and the ability to generate stuff based on that reasoning and communication. Meaning, AI is messy. Integrating it into our daily workflows is also messy because it's challenging us to rethink our relationship with technology. But as Kate Yordi, director of marketing at Visit Mesa, said during the board meeting this week, “Finally, we have some direction.” Phase 1: Leadership Alignment & Staff Communication As discussed at length in previous Destination AI posts, the DMO CEO must make it clear to all staff that the organization prioritizes AI because the organization prioritizes being relevant. It certainly helps, as is the case with Visit Mesa, when the CEO is fully backed by the board to invest in AI integration. During the board meeting, one member asked, “What do you need from us, Marc?” That’s a good sign. For the DMO AI Roadmap to work, all leadership needs to not only have a basic understanding of AI tools, they need to actually use them as well on a regular basis. That goes a long way in driving agency across the organization. However, making that happen typically requires some C-suite training to explain the primary AI models more indepth: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot and/or Google Gemini depending on the specific workplace platform(s) the organization uses. Identifying and prioritizing just a handful of AI models like that brings a lot of clarity to the process right off the bat. You see people's shoulders relax when they're confronted with 5-6 AIs versus dozens. (Yes, VEED, Gamma, Manus, Sora, Granola, Slack AI, etc., are all really cool but let's not start there.) A common lament among DMO leadership related to AI is, “Where do we even start?” Leadership should then discuss and begin to answer the five big questions all CEOs face when navigating AI integration, as vetted in the aforementioned Destination AI post about what CEOs want regarding AI education: How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI (who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI) to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and quality of work? How do we redevelop our content and channels to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI for business purposes to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The next step in this phase, at a basic level, is communicating to staff why they’re being asked to embrace AI. The following is not meant to be comprehensive, but a CEO would likely want to articulate: The purpose of the AI Roadmap, guiding principles, and the phases and processes involved How AI integration will take time and people will evolve at different paces It’s ok if everyone feels like they’re building the plane while flying it Everyone is encouraged to use AI and will be supported, but there will also be guardrails in place AI adoption and use cases will become part of employee reviews, but traditional roles, responsibilities and key success metrics are still the priority "How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents." — Marc Garcia, president and CEO, Visit Mesa Phase 2: Staff Assessment & AI Task Force Sitting down and asking staff how they feel about AI and how/if they’re using it is a good way to begin. Depending on the size of the organization, this can be done with every staff member individually or a representative group from each department. Generally people fall into three camps when it comes to AI: 1) Those who are already using AI on a regular basis; 2) those who are curious and have experimented a bit, but they don’t actively engage with AI tools; and 3) those who don’t see much value in AI. This last group can also include people who outright oppose AI, but they make themselves apparent pretty quickly. Data also shows there is often a significant percentage of staff who use AI in secret because they’re not sure they’re allowed to use it for work purposes. The second way to collect staff sentiment and AI capacity is with a blind online survey asking everyone what they like about AI, what concerns them, how they feel about job security, what they want to learn, what they hope to achieve, etc. Everything is anonymous so you can expect a wide variety of feedback ranging from constructive/optimistic to fears of an impending robot apocalypse. Once complete, all the data should be synthesized into key takeaways for leadership and shared with staff to show a high level of transparency right from the beginning of this process. The second part of this phase is developing an AI task force. The value of this cannot be overemphasized. Choose a small group of AI champions from various departments to do three things: Provide direction for stewarding the various processes in each phase as effectively as possible from beginning to end Share constructive and thoughtful input they’re hearing from other staff members about how things are proceeding well and where there are challenges Help scale AI adoption across teams by showing how they’re using AI effectively to everyone else in the organization An internal AI task force or council is invaluable because the members are motivated and they want to learn. Mostly, their enthusiasm and success with AI will begin to rub off on many of their colleagues and inspire self-learning and greater adoption among the teams. But not all. There will be those who disengage, and there can be a significant number of them. Over time, they should be consulted to understand their trepidation, which should then be addressed. This is a challenge I'm having with one organization where a significant cohort are saying they're too busy to learn AI. Meanwhile, the majority of the staff are reporting daily usage with effective results, which definitely wasn't the case a few months ago. And even with those leaning in, the level of improvement and AI Iearning will be slow at times. This is why it’s critical for the CEO and the rest of management to be all-in and consistently participate in staff training sessions to show direction, intention and support. It’s very easy for the novelty of AI training to wear off after the first few months. This is where the AI task force can be instrumental to help maintain overall staff interest and keep engagement levels as high as possible. "Finally, we have some direction." — Kate Yordi, director of marketing, Visit Mesa Phase 3: AI Policy & Investments Developing an official AI policy and governance manual accomplishes two primary objectives: It protects the organization against legal and financial liability by establishing how all employees are required to use AI responsibly. It encourages and gives license for staff to proactively experiment with AI because there are clear guidelines in place about how to do so. There are many DMOs who have created AI policies and are willing to share with the rest of the industry. These are typically not lengthy documents (3-4 pages) nor full of legalese. Generally they’re written so every single employee can understand everything in them. Sections in these policies often include: Positioning/Purpose Statement: Expresses how and why the organization needs to be intentional about implementing AI processes Primary Objectives and Intended Outcomes: Defines the business case for how the organization is attempting to deliver on its core mandate of driving revenue to local businesses in alignment with community priorities Guiding Principles: Establishes the principles of responsible AI use in alignment with the values of the organizations related to themes such as inclusivity, bias, authenticity, veracity, collaboration, knowledge sharing, etc. AI Definitions: Provides clear explanations of AI terminology used in the document and workplace AI Tools: Identifies specific AI models that the organization provides access to Data Input: Dictates clear rules about what employees can upload into AI models and what they can’t upload, such as personal information of any person Monitoring: Defines how the organization reserves the right to monitor AI practices Training & Support: Defines opportunities for professional growth and learning AI on an ongoing basis There are other items that DMOs might include in the above list, and they vary depending on how HR, financial and legal departments interpret AI governance, but it serves as a foundation. One key consideration for DMO leadership when it comes to policy is identifying which pro AI models to invest in. Paid AI tools provide higher levels of privacy and security because AI companies don’t train on them, or at least there’s the choice to select that option. Many DMOs, for example, purchase annual subscriptions for paid ChatGPT Team accounts ($25 per employee monthly) for staff to use for work, which is a first step for protecting the IP and other interests of the organization. Other paid AI models are then provided to specific departments based on need and the specific attributes of the tools, such as Claude for marketing and social media staff because many consider it the best AI for content creation. Phase 4: AI Education & Implementation This is the most important thing in training teams to embrace and use AI effectively. You want to foster an environment where structured learning evolves into self-learning. That’s the only way this scales. When staff members with little experience in AI start exploring how to use AI on their own, and they start helping their colleagues see new ways to use AI, that’s a pretty special thing. From an education standpoint, the DMO AI Roadmap begins at a high level defining AI’s place in online history. AI is the third transformational shift since the PC was invented, including: The mainstream web/internet in the 1990s; the evolution of mobile/social/cloud and apps in the 2000s; and gen AI in the 2020s. These are the only three times when big tech went all-in and pivoted their business models around a new technology. I then break AI training into the following buckets, and again, this is all very surface level and not meant to be comprehensive. Also, creating engaging demos are everything, and that's not also easy because AI demos can be a real slog sometimes. But, showing how different AIs provide real value is key for people to internalize their learning and use it more intuitively over time: Explain how pre-gen AI tech is deterministic and gen AI is probabilistic, which messes with a lot of people’s minds. Gen AI outputs are based on statistical patterns and probabilities, just like the human brain processes ideas and information. Traditional tech is based on absolutes, delivering the same output based on the same input. Old tech is about information. AI is about knowledge. Spend a lot of time on this with workshops and demos. Highlight the capabilities of only three AI models to start: ChatGPT for brainstorming and planning; Claude for writing and data analysis; and Perplexity for conversational search. The other two, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, are more general purpose. They also do amazing things (Gemini 2.5 Pro is great for reasoning), but focusing on the first three will provide direction at the beginning so people don’t get overwhelmed. At the very minimum, leadership should have a basic understanding of those three. Explain how AI search isn't 100% perfect but it's a 1,000% better than old search. Define how DMOs and all brnads are redesigning their websites and content strategy to optimize for AI search, and the basics of AI SEO . I would argue the most important thing for using AI is really understanding how generative AI = conversational AI. It's a dialogue. It's called "chat" for a reason. This is where I’ve heard the most positive feedback from teams I’ve worked with. It happens when people move beyond the Google mindset—where search is one and done—and they see the real value of iterative conversations with AI models that evolve with each exchange in the discussion, just like a human conversation. This also removes some misperceptions about how to prompt. Yes, there are some basic rules about how to prompt well. But beyond that, it’s vastly more beneficial to explore AI conversations further with thoughtful follow-up prompts that flow logically and organically to achieve the best results. Explore how the real value of AI extends beyond just efficiency and productivity gains. That's a dangerous dialogue with staff who can construe that as leading to more work or being terminated over time. The bigger value and better narrative is how AI increases creativity and knowledge, and how those both influence overall quality of work, marketing effectiveness, sales productivity, staff culture and pride, job satisfaction and growth opportunities, etc. Really dig into the advanced features of the paid models: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro. Aside from the added security and privacy they provide, they offer functions not available in the free models and their outputs are significantly better. ChatGPT Projects and custom GPTs, Claude Projects and Perplexity Spaces are where the magic happens. Create an environment where staff members are eager to share their successes with AI with the rest of the organization. This feedback loop is critical for steering education and driving adoption, and it’s one of the most important roles for the internal AI task force. AI-training meetings can be highly effective during video calls but they often have the greatest impact during in-person workshops. Also, make sure to give staff a specific amount of hours during the week to develop their AI skills. Explore options for AI chat platforms and the benefits they provide for visitors and local industry partners. I work with Matador Network, which developed the industry leading GuideGeek AI chat platform. The feedback from 35+ DMO clients is impressive and irrefutable, but there is still much work to do educating visitors and industry about AI chat strategy and their benefits to continually increase adoption and business outcomes. The DMO AI Roadmap also provides guidance for developing various learning and engagement formats: Schedule weekly or bi-weekly meetings specifically, and only, for AI training with both internal and external people sharing insights Create a library of AI educational materials for staff to reference Start a weekly internal AI newsletter to share how teams are using AI Start a Slack or similar channel dedicated for AI education, AI news updates, knowledge sharing, etc Start a weekly and optional one-hour AMA meeting for everyone to ask everyone else questions (highly effective) Create a regular schedule for staff to report back to leadership or department heads about how they’re using AI and what they’re achieving with it Phase 5: Success Tracking I kick off every AI presentation identifying the three AI models mentioned above—ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity—followed by the assertion that, "AI is the death of 'I don't know.'" That is arguably the biggest ROI for integrating AI in a DMO or any other type of organization. There are few questions that are too complex or too intimidating for DMO staff to approach with confidence and conviction if they know how to use those three AI models effectively. I shared an example previously where I used Perplexity Pro to educate myself about how board governance is evolving . That for me was something I knew was out of my realm of expertise, but now I feel I can speak with some semblance of authority about that to any board because of AI. Before gen AI, I dismissed board governance as one of those things I'd just have to leave in the dark. That said, trying to explain how AI helps staff become more self-reliant, where they can always build a foundation of understanding for anything to empower themselves, only goes so far with a board. They're looking for more quantitative KPIs. Here are just some examples of that in a DMO context. In 2025, defining KPIs for AI integration is an evolving science, and we as an industry are still figuring a lot of this out. Therefore, this list is nowhere near comprehensive and it will evolve, but we have ample data today to validate the following: Using AI for search and content development saves significant time and increases opportunities for higher output and increased creativity for producing blog posts, social media, videos, marketing campaigns, etc. Developing custom GPTs (in ChatGPT Plus) for group sales is a proven strategy for creating better, more customized proposals in much less time. That gives sales staff more time for brainstorming and prospecting leading to higher production. That's a fact. In this case, group sales people are actually pumped to try a new technology. Using AI for regression analysis and scenario modeling increases the accuracy of how DMOs predict visitor volumes year-round, event attendance, economic impact, etc. One of the biggest conversations in DMOs today is how to develop content and websites to rank higher in AI search. Developing best practices in AI SEO leads to higher traffic. That is a core mandate for any DMO, and no DMO can afford to ignore that over time. AI chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI are driving real business. As described in PhocusWire in March, New York City Tourism + Conventions launched its GuideGeek-powered "Ellis" meeting-specific AI chat in January. ROI to date: 100% increase in traffic to the meeting planner website, 800+ AI-driven queries in the first month, 50% growth in newsletter sign-ups, and 10% increase in time spent on the site. Summary The AI train has left the station and it's gaining steam. The DMO AI Roadmap is the next logical step for helping DMO CEOs and their teams integrate AI processes and platforms. As Visit Mesa's Kate Yordi said, "Finally, we now have direction." That's a big deal for DMO staff to feel that way. Generative AI has been with us for more than two years now, but a structured and phased approach for integrating AI across DMO departments has been the missing piece. Visit Mesa's DMO AI Roadmap is going to evolve as the team works through the process, but at least now there's a vision and scope. Visit Mesa CEO Marc Garcia and the board are fully committed—a critical first step for embarking on this journey. Also, this strategic framework for how DMOs approach AI is going to underpin the interactive AI Playground activation at U.S. Travel's upcoming ESTO conference in Phoenix, August 17-19. U.S. Travel and GuideGeek are partnering to develop educational programming for the hands-on AI training experience and series of thought leadership. Greg Oates

How AI Improves DMO and Community Master Planning Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Many DMOs are developing 10-year destination master plans to optimize their visitor economy in alignment with local community priorities. I've participated in producing dozens of them from Miami to Mesa. They often take as long as a year to complete because there's so much focus on community engagement in various formats: interviews, focus groups, town halls, surveys, visioning sessions, etc. The tourism industry talks about the importance of community a LOT. However, when you're working with a DMO, you never really dig into what actually moves the needle across so many endless community demands, not on a tactical and hyperlocal level. You're not really held accountable for any measure of success when it comes to community-specific initiatives, ranging from improving City Hall permitting processes for small businesses to tracking the movement of unhoused. A master plan needs to address those and amplify those kinds of pressing needs for the destination overall. The expectation is not really to fix them. That’s not the role of a DMO. It's a whole different ballgame when you're developing a long-term strategic framework for a community organization like Near Southside, Inc . in Fort Worth. Success and being accountable for fixing things is expected. Located at the periphery of the downtown core, Near Southside is the most interesting community in North America right now. The ex-industrial district can be loosely compared to Austin 20 years ago with the same cultural DNA and similar community values, based on a fiercely protective love for local, creative and independently owned small businesses. That's under threat. In the last few years, as Near Southside evolved into the coolest 'hood east and west of the Pecos Line, real estate prices are rising commensurately. We all know how this story often ends with the encroachment of national brands sanitizing the soul of a place that made it attractive in the first place. Near Southside is intent on rewriting that story. AI Processes for Strategic Planning Here's where AI comes in. Because of the multitude of overlapping challenges and evolving dynamics in the community, our team needs to crunch and debate a ton of qualitative and quantitative data. Addressing gentrification touches on so many aspects of how communities operate. Therefore, we are over-indexing on community engagement to get as many perspectives as possible to identify how the community best evolves in the face of rapid change. The amount of inputs we're getting is substantive, and we want to inventory all of it as thoroughly as possible to build a super comprehensive knowledge base for the AI to cull through, connect dots and output insights. Every individual zoom call with stakeholders is recorded with Granola AI, which produces full transcripts but the summaries are too light. So we created custom GPTs with instructions for everything we want in the summaries, including comprehensive overviews, key takeaways with detailed context for each, the most insightful quotes related to those takeaways, and all action items that stakeholders recommended. With the GPT, we can fire full transcripts into the chat, press "enter" and receive highly valuable, high quality and uniform summaries almost immediately. We're doing the same with the focus groups but the custom GPTs require a different set of instructions. The two-hour transcripts capture the conversations with 10-20 stakeholders convened across specific industry and community segments. For those, the GPTs bucket corresponding high-level takeaways and tactical action items related to the same theme. That has immeasurable value because these conversations are all over the place. It's great working with locals who are so passionate about where they live and how, but that means you're getting feedback from a firehose and someone taking notes doesn’t capture all the nuance. Using custom GPTs to produce these summaries and populate takeaways is as good or better than any team could do manually. Everything is stored in Airtable. Forget Google or Microsoft cloud platforms. Airtable is an AI-powered, relational database/spreadsheet beast for organizing data and automating basic workflows. The tables combine all project information in one place, such as a running list of pending/completed interviews and focus groups and their AI-generated summaries. Airtable can then auto-generate a summary of the summary in the same table for clients to easily review everything being collected on a daily basis to whatever degree they prefer. Once you use Airtable, you'll never look at Google Drive the same way again. I've never had so many insights so well organized, so thorough and so easy to share with a team and client to help inform each project phase. The client loves the transparency, immediacy and structure, naturally, versus waiting for the next weekly update to read a few bullet points in a PowerPoint. Here's the thing. Because we've been so intentional about collecting such a high quality and comprehensive volume of feedback, we have a motherlode of a knowledge base for AI to work with. We can then enter all that in bulk into Google NotebookLM or ChatGPT/Claude Projects to pull out anything from high-level aggregate takeaways to anything super customized or tactical. For example, the client was interested in hearing specifically just what developers had to say about gentrification. I wanted highlights related to anything discussed regarding City Hall processes. It’s super easy to pull reports together for those and anything else. Ultimately, you can use AI to deliver an outline, a strategy map and a very rough draft of a destination master plan. All you need to do is combine all of the above together, plus PDFs of all relevant public and private planning documents, PDFs of all relevant case studies and best practices, and detailed instructions about the purpose, elements, structure, etc., of the plan. People will disagree, sure. I'm not dismissing the expertise of people who put these things together, because they bring deep context to every conversation and decision made during the development of a master plan. Everything happening now in Near Southside has happened somewhere else. When you can bring takeaways from those places to any present situation, it helps provide direction for everyone in the room. Again, I’m not saying that AI is replacing humans. People get all kinds of worked up over that, especially in travel and tourism. I am saying you can create a better, more strategic and more informed master plan in a much more streamlined fashion when you employ AI strategically to better prepare a community for the future. That's just a fact. I have four more community focus groups today in Near Southside. The expectation among everyone is that their contributions will make a demonstrable difference in their neighborhood. We can’t just speak to the challenges. We need to fix them and our processes with AI are giving everyone more confidence that we can deliver on that. Wondering how many DMOs are interested in employing similar AI-first strategies to get a better handle on how to help their communities. Greg Oates

How Visit Richmond is Using AI to Sell More Conventions Aug 2 Written By Greg Oates DMO CEOs want specific use cases for AI showing how they drive measurable business results. Here's a great example for capitalizing on AI to drive meetings and conventions volume from Lauran Peoples , director of sales marketing and business development at Visit Richmond in Virginia. Peoples works in the organization's 13-person sales team and reports to the VP of sales. Her role has three core functions: She is the main liaison between the destination sales and marketing departments; she develops and leads campaign strategy for the sales department; and she works with her colleagues to optimize strategic partnerships. Peoples' role is somewhat unique as a liaison between sales and marketing in that she lives on the sales side, versus marketing. She also stands out in our industry as an emerging voice in AI innovation. If you're going to U.S. Travel's ESTO conference this month in Phoenix, look for her and me working in the show's inaugural AI Playground educational activation. Greg Oates: Can you explain your role at Visit Richmond, specifically in terms of how you bridge the sales and marketing teams? Lauran Peoples: It's becoming more common in DMOs for sales teams to have a marketing liaison, but usually that person is based on the marketing team and is mostly assigned to sales to help with creative. The issue is when that marketing liaison is based on the marketing team, they don't have much exposure to the field and what's happening out of market with your salespeople. Our sales team has 45 trade shows this upcoming fiscal year, so they're traveling almost every week. With my situation in Richmond, they're getting real-time data and downloads about what's happening in each destination, so that gives them more authentic conversations to engage planners. Not having someone assigned to a team like that creates a huge disconnect and leaves opportunity on the table. GO: Tell us a little about your journey with AI. LP: I've been working in hospitality for 20 years. Last year, I heard some younger people on the team talking about ChatGPT. So I was like, okay, I don't know anything about that. I went to PCMA Convening Leaders in January and the opening session was all about AI. I remember sitting there feeling like a dinosaur. Feeling very behind. I realized this is a lot more serious and widespread than I thought, so I left and tasked myself with using ChatGPT once a day. Initially, I couldn't differentiate how it wasn't like Google. I was asking it how many tablespoons are in this or that, kind of thing. Since then, my understanding of AI has progressively increased around more complex and comprehensive capabilities. It has streamlined my productivity, but more importantly, AI has become a thought partner for me to bounce all these ideas and scenarios around that I didn't have before. I think that a lot of people are adopting AI and using it as a communications assistant, or a writing assistant. But the part for me that's really exciting and valuable with AI is analyzing and aggregating data and getting it to show you things that you need help with, like sales. GO: Can you share an example? LP: Sure. I took five datasets: five years of lost business, five years of definite business, and three marketing reports from different campaigns we were running with outside agencies like Sojourn and Digital Edge. Those campaigns give us demographic insights because we were targeting certain areas. I also grabbed our sales deployment sheet, which tells you who has what market. I uploaded all of those into ChatGPT and asked it to identify the top five locations for each of our managers based on their market segments. Some results weren't surprising, but there were a few that popped up like Orlando that we've never traditionally considered. When I asked ChatGPT why Orlando, it showed how the city has a large hobby market. It turns out there are a lot of hobby conventions that meet in Orlando. After I compiled the top five locations for each manager, I asked ChatGPT to give me the top five accounts in each of those locations. Then I asked for unique selling propositions for each of those accounts as to why Richmond would be a perfect fit. Finally, I asked it to rank those five destinations based on probability of success. GO: Have you seen any of this result in new business opportunities? LP: Yes. One location that showed up was Philadelphia. Richmond is four hours from Philadelphia, but like Orlando it hasn't typically been on our radar. However, based on the data from ChatGPT, Philly came up as a recommendation. So we sent one of our sales managers to Philadelphia, and she ended up hosting 18 planners, including some who drove from over an hour away to see her. She got such a great response that I had to jump in and go with her because she couldn't host 18 clients by herself. AI has now informed our sales strategy for Philly, and the region is now part of our dedicated sales strategy. We've allocated funds for that sales manager in Philly to join chapters of organizations like MPI and PCMA. So that's how we know there had to be some accuracy to our approach with AI. GO: How do the sales managers feel about you doing this AI analysis? LP: They appreciate it. It's a balance because most sales managers at DMOs aren't entry level; they've been in hospitality for a long time. This is a new process and a new tool for them. Some have destinations they like to go to over and over because they're successful there. But my role is to support business enablement and sales enablement to help them do what they do better and uncover new business. So how we're using AI provides them with additional actionable research. GO: I think one of the most underrated strategies for AI is developing custom GPTs in ChatGPT to help sales teams develop more customized and effective proposals more quickly. Are you building those at all? LP: Yes, definitely. About a month and a half ago, I programmed a GPT for the sales team called "Prospecting Partner." It's trained on our sales collateral and all our information, so it knows our convention packages and understands our jurisdiction and seven localities. The sales managers have been using it to prospect smarter. I included suggested prompts to go beyond just, "Give me a prospecting email." We can get really specific, like, "Help me re-engage an association planner who just lost grant funding." It also provides strategies specifically related to that, and then you can ask how to execute those strategies. So, for example, we know from reports that finance and insurance is an opportunity market for us. It's a small percentage of our current business but it has the highest average daily rate, which makes it very attractive to our hotel partners. So our salespeople are asking ChatGPT for ways we can develop business in the finance and insurance market, and really dig into that. Ultimately, AI is helping our sales team think bigger, smarter and more strategically. I've asked the sales team if they found this helpful, and, you know, salespeople are not an easy crowd. They said yes across the board. With the ChatGPT Enterprise version, I can't see their exact prompts due to privacy, but I can see the number of conversations they're having with the tool, so I know they're actively using it. GO: How are other people on your team using AI? LP: My two direct reports are our CRM database administrator and our sales coordinator. My sales coordinator does support work for the entire team, so she's using ChatGPT a lot for ideation, like when a sales manager needs an itinerary to entertain clients in Chicago. My CRM database administrator uses ChatGPT as a communication assistant because sometimes analytical personality types can benefit from exploring more communication nuances. She's also started incorporating it into data cleanup, using it to analyze reports and suggest what's missing or what would be beneficial. She uses it to help fill in gaps and identify what's not being asked or said. GO: What are some of your future plans with AI? LP: We're launching microsites for destination sales and sports, and I think it will set a model for the rest of the organization because we’re replacing our website from pre- to post-AI, like most DMO sites these days. We're currently writing copy for the microsites, and I've been getting into structured data and semantic clarity. You don't search ChatGPT or prompt ChatGPT with the same language you search Google, so content has to be written differently. Previously, you'd go to Google and say "restaurants near me." Now with ChatGPT, it's more of a conversation, so you'll say, "Hey, I'm in Scott's Addition historic district in Richmond with my kids, and we're looking for a vegan restaurant." That semantic clarity allows AI to respond with much more specific answers. I think we need to anticipate AI searches, as opposed to Google searches, in how we write content. Everyone is subconsciously expecting a personally curated experience today. When I go on Amazon, I'm expecting it to make connections that I like this, so I might also like this, without me having to tell it certain things. That's where we have to move towards, or we get eclipsed or become obsolete, especially if we're just thinking of ourselves as brokers for a destination. Greg Oates

Visit Phoenix CEO on Leading AI Strategy and Being Chill About It Jul 28 Written By Greg Oates I learned a lot about how DMO leaders can confidently integrate AI processes into their organizations after speaking with Ron Price, CDME, president and CEO of Visit Phoenix. Price is somewhat new to AI but his staff have been doing cool things with various LLMs for a while. He says his primary role with AI is providing the Visit Phoenix team with an enabling environment for success built on a culture of trust. Price accomplishes that by inspiring everyone to experiment with AI, be aware of the liabilities, share their wins, have fun with it, reach out to others for advice, and most of all, validate everything. Although, what stood out for me the most talking with Price is his calm and clear approach to AI, basically inferring (in my words, not his)... "We got this. We might do something amazing today with AI or we might not, but either way we're fully committed to seeing what it can do. We're also going to figure this AI thing out by collaborating with our many DMO industry friends. Because AI is going to change everything in a hurry, and we at Visit Phoenix are not going to be caught staring out at a Sonoran sunset while the world passes our city by." That's the vibe I got. That's leadership. That's what being a CEO means, at least for me. AI is confusing, sure, and CEOs have to worry about their boards and electeds. The thing is, we're more than two and a half years into generative AI now, and it's not going to wait for CEOs to decide if they can "trust AI" or not. I think we can all learn from Price a few things: We can de-escalate all the hubris and hand-wringing surrounding AI by being open to possibilities and having a clear set of principles, especially related to responsible AI use and verification. You can have fun with AI and focus on business outcomes at the same time. The DMO industry needs to collaborate and share best practices more intentionally to accelerate AI education, innovation and integration. We must encourage DMO staff to use AI today so they can steer the future of our industry tomorrow. Price likes talking about AI. I would encourage any DMO CEOs on the fence with AI to reach out to him. Greg Oates: Ron, how do you use AI? Ron Price: I use AI every single day, going back now about a month and a half. I'm just fascinated and interested in what it's able to do. I wouldn't say I'm an early adopter, of course, although there are some people who aren't even on it yet. Me personally, I use it for everything, like if I'm curious about something that's happening within the region. Or maybe I want to quickly compile a lot of data to help solve a problem or answer questions as I get ready for different meetings. More or less, my brain is always just firing, like, "What if we tried this or that?" And so, this year has been a cool realization about what AI can do, and seeing how it's pulling all the sources through to validate what it responds with. We have also integrated AI with Microsoft Copilot. We pay for everyone to have access to that, and then we also have a ChatGPT Team account for our staff. GO: Where else are you seeing value with AI at Visit Phoenix? RP: In our world, it's marketing, it's content. I love being surrounded by people who can write really well. It's an art to me, and I don't possess that art. It's like someone playing the piano. I'm in awe of that. So AI gives people the ability to write better, and it's okay to lean into it. Don't feel threatened by it. AI is able to give you that one golden nugget, or it suggests that one good idea that can really help someone when they're writing. Here's the fun part. Every day, we're learning something unique. We have the Cronkite School of Journalism in Phoenix, and some of the students are here. We kind of give them free rein, and we're also teaching them at the same time. The way that they use AI is amazing. It's fun to walk down the hall to see them because I'm always like, "How did you write that? How did you create that image? How did you pull that data and research together?" It's just a different generation. We're also seeing where our people are asking AI things like, "If I'm a salesperson, how do I influence a group to come here in the middle of the summer for a conference? Why is it fun to be here for a conference when it's 110 degrees out?" And what does AI have to say? Well, one thing that's great about, say, Grok, for example, it's pulling from all these little texts on Twitter, or X. They're from people saying, "Hey, I know it's summertime in Phoenix but look what I got to do." Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use. GO: Does your staff using AI increase your organization's impact in the community? RP: We not only focus on growing tourism in our community, but we're also joined at the hip with economic development. We look at our role as we're here to build a better community through tourism. And so, when you think about utilizing all the data out there, we always ask ourselves, "How could AI help us consolidate that data and crunch the numbers faster to give us a clearer picture of what we think we know?" For example, how much business that comes in through our leads touch our priority sectors? And of those sectors, which ones align extremely well with what we're doing here at Visit Phoenix? Is it semiconductors? Is it bio-med? Is it something that leans into the engineering side because of what ASU and the Department of Defense are doing? We've seen we can go back and look at the data and get a better picture of those things now. Also, as an example, we have a high propensity to book business around the semiconductor space. So we're utilizing these AI tools to quickly do research like, "Give me a list of the top semiconductor conferences that take place around the world." The responses are quicker and the results are better versus doing a traditional Google search. It's able to pull from a lot of different sources, so that's another way we're using AI. “Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use.” GO: How do you define the role of a CEO to guide a DMO forward with AI? RP: Setting up the rules of the game is important. There are areas of liability we have to be aware of about what you can and can't be pulling in. Those are the types of things we needed to figure out, you know, basically, "What is our rule book for using AI?" I like giving people the ability to use AI as they will. I think it works best whenever people know that it's a tool we want them to utilize. And if it can help us at the end of the day tell a better story, be smarter as we go after business, and be smarter with our analytics to help build our marketing strategy stronger, then use it. I try to build a team of leaders so they're CEOs of their own divisions, and I want them to be thought leaders in their areas. Also, I think AI enables us to get to answers quickly, but, and this is important, how do we validate those answers? We're really good at Visit Phoenix when it comes to validating answers, but we're usually doing it by going the long way and understanding how AI responded like it did. We're reading source by source by source, and then we kind of come to our own conclusion. It's like we're not just focused on the punch line of a joke. We can also tell you the structure of the joke. You always have to validate. We get excited about using AI because it just puts us in a new position. I think it's good to have a CEO that supports that, but that support comes from a trust within the organization. I trust that people are going to utilize AI to help make us better. GO: What keeps you up at night regarding AI? RP: My fear is how do we control and ensure that someone isn't producing something negative on our behalf, and then launching it to the world, and using this incredible tool to hurt us? Because there are people that are extremely gullible who believe whatever they're looking at. That's kind of where my brain goes sometimes. It's only because of what I've already seen these tools can do. I think across the DMO industry, we'll have some "ahas," especially when we get together in various forums to exchange ideas. We need to be talking with each other about, "Here are some things that work really well with AI, and here are the headwinds." And then, "These are the things you need to realize could happen with AI, and here are some ways you can mitigate those problems." The more we can learn from others about how they're using AI, the better. I think what you're putting together about AI strategy with all your insights is going to be extremely valuable. GO: Thank you. So, what are you thinking about next with AI? RP: As AI continues to grow, and we've talked about it here internally, what is the value of a website? In fact, we just started our next fiscal year, July 1. Website visits is no longer a key metric that we're going after. As a leader, I like knowing what's three steps ahead. We currently have these tools, but how are they going to change the way we make decisions going forward? At some point, a lot of what we're talking about now is going to be white noise. And what then? It doesn't mean our jobs of promoting a destination change. It means we're going to get so much better at telling our story through so many different avenues. I believe that our reach is actually going to broaden. We're still going to be responsible for promoting our destination and selling our destination, but how we tell the story and how we show the story is going to change as these tools evolve. Back in the day, a lot of us were reading about Moore's Law and how things just keep improving and getting cheaper, especially in technology. Now we're moving into a space where the rate of growth with AI is going to be something we've never seen before. Greg Oates

German Convention Bureau Leader on the Future of AI-Powered Meetings Jul 27 Written By Greg Oates After the global financial crisis ended in 2011, a few cities and nations around the world began promoting themselves to meeting and convention organizers based on their intellectual capital, versus venues and attractions. Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau (GCB), led this strategy in Europe at the time. Around the same year, I was visiting the House of Logistics & Mobility (HOLM) think tank in Frankfurt. The GCB suggested I visit there to better understand this new direction for attracting high-value business events in advanced industries. "The city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," Dr. Stefan Walter told me, who was a professor at HOLM at the time. "So, this [GCB] strategy is about finding the strengths of our strengths, our core competencies, and for Germany, that’s knowledge and infrastructure. It’s also about connecting ideas.” That has been my due north working in the travel industry ever since. This idea that meeting planners and attendees can tap into a deep knowledge base in a host destination, specific to their interests, for me, is intoxicating. The challenge is it takes a ton of work connecting local leaders in specific advanced industries, like aviation in Frankfurt or e-mobility in Stuttgart, with large global organizations in those same industries and convince them to bring their big annual event to Germany. It's also pretty high level. From an attendee standpoint, if I'm in Hamburg and want to learn about HafenCity, the largest urban makeover in Europe, it's not like I can easily access a bunch of people and organizations leading the future of urban development. Which, would be cool, right? AI is helping make that a reality. Germany's national Open Data/Knowledge Graph project is an ambitious AI-powered initiative to build a massive network of industry suppliers, academic organizations and business leaders across the country. Basically, by indexing the visitor industry and intellectual capital supply chain, Germany can connect the brightest minds in Germany with the rest of the world more seamlessly, effectively and equitably. An "interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," if you will. I spoke with Mr. Schultze to learn more about how AI is impacting the meetings and convention industry in Germany. Greg Oates: How is AI evolving across Germany's visitor industry? Specifically, how are your municipal CVBs and other partners thinking about and using AI right now? Matthias Schultze: Like much of the world, things really accelerated for us around two years ago with the rise of tools like ChatGPT. Suddenly, everyone, from corporates to associations, started thinking seriously about AI. We saw an opportunity and created an innovation platform called ebx.lab . It’s a peer-to-peer learning community for event planners, where we partner with scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute to explore how AI might reshape the business events space. From those early sessions, we have published a few white papers and identified a few core insights. AI clearly has potential to personalize experiences, optimize event planning processes, improve engagement and networking, and maybe most exciting, support predictive analytics. That last one, especially, being able to anticipate trends or behaviors based on data, is what feels most transformative to me personally. GO: How is the GCB embracing AI internally? MS: We developed our own internal AI strategy for the German Convention Bureau. We wanted to give both our team and our stakeholders a shared framework, something that outlined where we are today, where we want to go, and how we get there. It’s called "Driven by People, Powered by Data," and that title really reflects our belief that AI is a tool, not a solution in itself. People need to lead the process. The strategy helps us clarify not just what we can do with AI, but also what we can’t or shouldn’t do, at least not yet. It outlines our roadmap and aligns everyone across our organization and membership. GO: Is that strategy available publicly? MS: Yes, though only in German for now. But with the right AI tools, you can translate it quickly. The strategy touches on everything from marketing and communications to event planning, workflow automation, customer personalization, sustainability, and even ethics and compliance. The ethics component is particularly important. As exciting as AI is, we have to keep guardrails in place. Within our organization, we’re working hard to ensure that AI isn’t something siloed or limited to leadership. It needs to be embedded across every level. Everyone in the organization is expected to develop basic AI literacy. We’ve also worked on minimum viable products for things like dashboards and customer-facing chatbots. Some are already in use today. GO: You've always been a strong and vocal proponent for sustainability in business events. How is AI supporting you there? MS: I’m very proud of a project we developed with 29 other European countries: the Sustainability Hub for Events . It’s an AI-driven platform that brings together all kinds of sustainability related data—certifications, guidelines, best practices—and makes them accessible through an interactive AI agent. Planners can ask things like, “Can you help me build a sustainable menu?” or input event details to estimate their CO₂ footprint. It’s highly practical, and it’s making a real difference for event planners who need fast, reliable and actionable sustainability information. GO: We've talked about your Open Data and Knowledge Graph project in Germany numerous times in the past. Is that now live? MS: It’s technically live but still in progress, and probably always will be, in a sense. We’re continuously expanding it. The Open Data Germany project by the German National Tourist Board is live with its Knowledge Graph. The Open Data MICE project, which is implemented in close cooperation with the GNTB, is not yet live. One exciting element launching soon is an interactive map of research institutions in Germany. It will show where key research and innovation is taking place, including medical tech, renewable energy and so on, and link that data to infrastructure like hotels and conference venues. The idea is to visualize Germany as a knowledge landscape. If you’re planning an event and you want to anchor it around a theme like urban mobility, the map will show you which regions are most active in that field and match you with the relevant venues and experts. GO: One theme I keep obsessing about, and it's felt like a bit of a fantasy for more than a decade, is that the city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine. That idea is a direct quote from your House of Logistics and Mobility in Frankfurt, and it’s stuck with me ever since I heard it back in 2011. It's this idea of a city as a platform. Do you think we're getting closer to executing on this idea, where innovation at all levels is more accessible and shareable for more people? Ultimately what we're talking about here is the democratization of knowledge and excellence. MS: I love that idea. I really do. I think there are two layers to it. On one level, we have the smart city movement with systems that integrate transportation, energy, data and infrastructure to make better decisions. That’s already happening in many places across Europe. But on a deeper level, regarding your fantasy.... Let's say you could land in Munich, be interested in urban tech, and immediately connect with people, events and institutions aligned with that interest—that’s becoming possible too. The data already exists. It’s just scattered. But with open data standards, machine readability, and the right AI tools, we can start connecting those dots. Your fantasy city may not be so far off.

CONTENT:
A CEO's Playbook for AI Integration Oct 10 Written By Greg Oates Your competitors are talking about AI. Your board is asking about AI. Your partners want to see your AI strategy. Many DMOs are debating the potential of AI, while an increasing number of others are already extracting real business and organizational value. The difference isn't budget or technical talent. It's knowing exactly where to look for opportunities and how to scale what works. 3 Non-Negotiables You Must Lead This, Not Delegate It: AI transformation dies in committee. The organizations seeing real results have CEOs who champion specific initiatives, remove bureaucratic friction, and signal that AI adoption is a strategic priority. This doesn't mean micromanaging prompts. It means creating air cover for teams to experiment and fail fast. Complex Impresses, Simple Delivers: Your instinct will be to pursue the flashy, sophisticated AI applications that sound impressive in board presentations. Resist it. The organizations generating real ROI start with mundane problems: expense report processing, meeting summarization, competitive monitoring, etc. These boring use cases build organizational confidence and create the foundation for more ambitious projects. Your People Know Where the Problems Are: The best AI applications emerge from the intersection of daily frustration and technological possibility. Run hackathons. Create cross-functional workshops. Ask your teams what they do that feels like waste. The solutions they surface will be more practical and impactful than anything your consultants recommend. Start Here Stop looking for AI opportunities everywhere. Focus your organization's attention on three specific areas where AI creates immediate, measurable value. The Tedium Tax: Every role in your organization includes mind-numbing tasks that consume time without creating value: data entry, compliance documentation, procurement reports, staff vacation tracking, etc. Think of these as your "Anti To-Do List." These are tasks systematically eliminated by asking, "How can I never have to do this again?" Your teams are paying a tedium tax every day. AI is the refund. The Expertise Bottleneck: Projects stall when teams hit the limits of their skills and wait for other departments. Marketing needs data analysis and campaign design mockups. Finance and HR need custom GPTs. Sales needs meetings-related technical specifications translated into customer language. AI breaks these bottlenecks by giving every team superpowers they never had before. The Blank Page Problem: Knowledge work involves ambiguous challenges where the path forward isn't clear: Strategy development, market analysis, problem diagnosis, etc. AI excels at generating multiple approaches, analyzing incomplete information, and proposing next steps when your teams are stuck. It's the thinking partner that's always available and never runs out of ideas. 6 Use Cases OpenAI's analysis of 600+ successful implementations across various industries reveals that virtually every valuable AI application falls into one of six categories. Show your teams these six use cases and they'll start finding opportunities everywhere. Content Creation: Use AI for first drafts of everything: strategy documents, marketing campaigns, product and experience descriptions, customer and community communications. AI maintains your brand voice while eliminating the blank page problem. Research and Synthesis: AI powers information gathering at superhuman speed, including market analysis, competitive intelligence, customer feedback synthesis, regulatory research, etc.. AI doesn't just find information. It structures it exactly how you need it for decision-making. Coding for Everyone: Your non-technical teams can now write Python scripts, SQL queries, and data visualizations. Your engineering teams debug faster and prototype in unfamiliar languages. AI democratizes technical capability while accelerating your experts. Data Analysis Without Degrees: Upload spreadsheets, dashboard screenshots or raw data files and get structured analysis without requiring PhD-level statistics knowledge. This is arguably the most undervalued opportunity that delivers immediate results for most DMOs. Strategic Thinking Partner: AI is a beast for brainstorming, scenario planning, product and event development, asset mapping, risk analysis, etc. AI helps structure complex problems and identifies considerations your teams might miss. This is my favorite use case for AI. Intelligent Automation: Use platforms like n8n, Relay and others to create repeatable processes that run themselves, such as weekly competitive updates, financial reporting, sales and marketing workflows, a ton of admin duties, etc. Create the process once, then let AI handle the execution while humans focus on exceptions and strategy. Implementation is Where DMOs Fail Most AI initiatives fail because organizations treat them like traditional software deployments. They're not. AI is about change management and behavioral transformation up and down the org chart. AI implementation requires different approaches to discovery, prioritization and scaling. Systematic Opportunity Hunting: Don't wait for AI use cases to emerge organically. Run structured discovery sessions where teams audit their workflows for repetitive tasks, skill bottlenecks, and ambiguous challenges. Make this process ongoing, not a one-time exercise. The Impact-Effort Matrix: Not every AI opportunity deserves attention. Prioritize based on business impact versus implementation effort. Quick wins build momentum. High-value, high-effort projects become strategic investments. Everything else gets parked until technology makes it easier. Innovation as Culture: Internal competitions accelerate discovery while building AI literacy across your organization. The goal isn't technical sophistication. It's practical business solutions that teams actually want to use. Measure What Matters: Track time saved, accuracy improved, costs reduced and capability expansion. But also measure qualitative impacts: employee satisfaction, process improvements, competitive advantages. Use this data to guide scaling decisions. Build Your AI Process Move beyond random experimentation to systematic capability building. I like Estée Lauder's 5-phase process to ensure repeatable success with AI. Does this resonate with you for your DMO? Design: Define your purpose, scope and success criteria for AI integration in a 2-page brief. No scope creep. No technical complexity for its own sake. Prepare: Ask department heads to gather relevant data and best practices. AI tools should reflect organizational knowledge, not generic approaches. Build and Test: Hire contractors where necessary to help teams develop automations/agents, implement training, integrate datasets and validate accuracy. Focus on usability, not just functionality. Launch: Deploy with user guides and change management support. Technology deployment is easy. User adoption across all departments is a total headache at first. Optimize: Feedback loops drive continuous improvement based on actual usage patterns. AI applications evolve with business needs and improved capabilities. Key Insight: Always start with fundamental questions: Why build this? What problem does it solve? What impact will it have? Is the measurement for success quantitative or qualitative? Organizations that answer these questions clearly will build more successful AI applications than those focused primarily on technical capability. Build AI-Native Workflows The most sophisticated implementations integrate AI across entire business processes rather than individual tasks. This evolution positions organizations for the agentic AI capabilities coming next. Process Decomposition: Break complex workflows into constituent tasks, identify where each AI use case category adds value, and create integrated approaches spanning from research through execution. Marketing workflows might integrate research for market understanding, analysis for opportunity mapping, ideation for strategy, content creation for product and destination development, and automation for distribution. Cross-Functional Integration: AI facilitates better collaboration by translating between departments. Technical specifications become marketing language. Customer requirements inform sales priorities. Financial models drive strategic planning. Future-Proofing for Agents: Current workflow integration prepares your organization for AI agents that can complete entire projects independently. Teams that understand how to break processes into AI-addressable components will leverage these capabilities immediately when available. The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done. This cognitive shift creates advantages that compound over time and become increasingly difficult for competitors to replicate. "The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done." Key Takeaways The question isn't whether AI will transform our industry. It's whether you'll be leading that transformation or reacting to it. Start with clear, achievable use cases and systemic approaches to build the organizational muscle needed for transformation. AI advantage isn't about having the most technical teams or biggest budgets. It's about developing capabilities for organization-wide discovery, adoption, implementation and scaling of practical business solutions. The organizations moving beyond experimentation to systematic implementation today will be best positioned to leverage the more sophisticated AI capabilities emerging tomorrow. The agents are coming. Will you be ready? Greg Oates

The ROI of AI Agents Aug 21 Written By Greg Oates Based on a bunch of conversations at DI Annual 2025 this month, it's clear that many DMO executives still equate generative AI primarily with writing and editing in ChatGPT. But as one COO of a large U.S. DMO told me, "Surely there's more to all this than just learning about prompting." So many ways to respond to that. Meanwhile, there are also DMO leaders who established AI road maps for their organizations going back two years. For them, they're increasingly focused on developing AI-powered automated workflows and their more sophisticated cousins, AI agents. The purpose of these synthetic workflows is to automate tedious, time-consuming and repetitive tasks to free up staff to focus on more high-value work. Think of it as an evolution from using AI to building AI. You begin by visually mapping what people do in your organization. Then you identify where AI can potentially take over all the mundane stuff better and faster. I’ve been working with my colleagues at Matador Network to develop automated workflows for our Studio team. We have endless terabytes of client video created during the last 10 years. Now, with AI, we want to capitalize on those existing assets to create new video, but first we need to use AI to understand what we actually own. We contracted Erick Bonilla , founder of Pocho.tech based in Uruguay, to build a series of new AI workflows in n8n. One of the automations is designed to cull through 10 years of video files in Dropbox and catalogue everything in Airtable. The AI then creates standardized file names, project IDs, links for raw edited videos and finished client hero/cutdown videos, and location and content tags. The cost to develop the AI workflow was about $2,000 all-in, and it saved more than a month of work at a mid-level manager salary. The beauty of automations/agents is you can measure ROI annually fairly easily, which will help wake up your board if they're sleeping on AI. Moreover, once an automation is in place, the savings will continue to accrue in the future indefinitely for tasks still required, and there’s zero human error. During a staff Zoom, I asked members of our Studio team if they felt these new agents signaled to them the beginning of the end of some people’s jobs. The response was unanimous. Nobody wants to do this type of repetitive grunt work. I spoke with Bonilla for his take on the future of AI agents. Greg Oates: Erick, what services does Pocho.tech provide? Erick Bonilla: We identify opportunities within organizations of all sizes, where we believe implementing AI systems can dramatically improve the efficiency of operations. We can create workflows that process data, or we can create AI agents capable of reasoning, analyzing data, creating reports, and providing decision-makers with an enhanced way of digesting information. I have been doing this for almost two years, working with people mostly in the Middle East, the US and Latin America. The Pocha company site is brand new as I try to expand in the world of AI. GO: What’s the difference between automated workflows and agents? EB: A workflow is like a mass production factory. It's a set of operations that work through specific logic to automate a repetitive process that a human has done before. This could be writing and reading emails, writing summaries, reformatting and transferring content through different tools and applications, etc. An AI agent is a thinking environment that makes decisions for you. You can set a workflow for reading your emails. But then you can have an AI agent that summarizes your emails and tells you, if you have 10 emails, what those 10 emails are about in just one email, SMS text, WhatsApp message, Google doc or whatever. GO: So an AI agent has more autonomy and decision-making capabilities than an automated workflow? EB: Definitely. The AI agent is capable of being completely autonomous to make decisions within a given context. You give it a context with defined restrictions that narrows the scope of the decisions it can make. GO: Can you provide any success stories where you worked with a client who had a specific challenge, and you created an automated workflow or agent that successfully delivered a solution? EB: The most recent example is an EdTech company in Boston that provides a training and placement program for clean energy jobs. They've been operating for the past five years, but there’s been a lack of funds, employees and program applicants to scale beyond Massachusetts. So they decided to use AI and automation to build flows without having to invest a lot of money in hiring people. What I did was streamline the application process for people interested in entering the educational program. We created a form and a workflow that takes the information from the application and puts it into an application tracking system. This system has workflows that can trigger emails, daily reports, weekly reports and invitations to interview. Then I created an AI agent. Once the applicants are interviewed by a human, we take the transcript of that, analyze it using AI, and build a report for the decision maker so they can decide if this person is capable of entering the program or not. We also created a scoring system. We built it based on human criteria, which is subjective, and then we converted that into an objective dataset so we could classify people and score them based on numbers. All of this is done by an AI agent that sets a score for the applicant at the end of the interview. Then we have a leaderboard where people are ranked, and the top 15 get into the education program and placement process. GO: Were they happy with the end result? EB: Oh yeah, very happy. Here's where the beauty and magic come in. Now the CEO can envision a way of expanding outside Massachusetts, and tell her team, "Hey, we're going to New York!" Where before, she thought she needed to hire more people in each new state to oversee the operation. And, because an AI agent works 24/7, she doesn't have to wait until 8am to get a report or transcription, or anything anymore. So now, she can think about how to scale her company more successfully without having to hire more people. GO: What's the road map looking ahead? Where are you going with the company in terms of next steps? EB: We're trying to create an outreach system because the purpose of the company is not only to train people but also to place them in clean tech job positions. The outreach system is going to help the team find more companies with open positions, so the company can place more people in those positions. We’re building a system involving AI agents and workflows where we're going to take a picture of all the open positions and analyze and understand them using AI. We want to know, what are the requirements in terms of learning and knowledge capacity for people to get in these positions, so the company can build a better training program. GO: What was the biggest challenge working with them? EB: I think the most important one, and this is something anyone working on this will experience, is the resistance of some team members who don't trust the performance of AI enough. People who have low experience working with AI, and maybe only know ChatGPT, will look at this and say, "I don't believe this can work." So that means there’s a lot of educational work. People need enough knowledge about what AI tools are capable of to suggest what can and can’t work. I think that's the main challenge. But once people see it working, they start to lean into AI. Suddenly, they become like, "This is great. Can you add this other metric? Can you make it do this other thing too? Can you make me one for my personal side hustle?" It's interesting when you see people moving from resistance to acceptance. GO: Working with you has firmly cemented something I've been preoccupied with this year. It's this: One of the most exciting things about AI, which is giving us more time back during the day, requires the most boring thing, which is having uniform file and data structure. As we've discovered together only too well, AI can't reach its full potential unless you have everything structured super cleanly. The analogy I often use is that AI is like an 8-year-old savant. The person is brilliant but he or she often needs really consistent environments and clear guardrails, or things go sideways or just crash. Can you talk about what any organization needs to focus on when it comes to file and data structure? EB: I think one of the most basic things, and I'm living this with a company I'm helping right now, is documenting files and folders exactly the same. You must set protocols for everything when you’re building a folder system to store content and data. That's one of the biggest challenges for companies trying to implement AI automation with poorly standardized systems. When we didn’t have AI a few years ago, we didn't think of a machine reading our documents or files. We never thought that could be possible, so we never really focused on creating really good file structure. The biggest challenge for companies, coming back to Matador, is how to organize the field of play so that AI doesn't struggle. We easily lose the excitement of implementing AI in an organization when an AI is trying to navigate a maze of poorly organized files. For that, you need to build SOPs that tell everyone on the team, “We're going to be naming files this way now so that a 5-year-old can read the titles and understand what's in every one of them. Because if a 5-year-old can read this set of folders and understand what's inside all of them, then AI can do that too. And if AI can find and read everything, then AI can do some truly amazing things and save companies a lot of money. GO: So how are organizations like ours, which have been in operation for a long time, supposed to go back decades and reorganize all our files? EB: We can run a workflow that can do that for you. That's where the ROI comes in. You can make a one-time investment building a workflow that's going to completely standardize all your filing and foldering. But if you do that, you have to know that the ROI might not show up right away. It's going to start paying off later in terms of the time, money, stress and everything it’s going to give back. A CEO must understand that the return on that investment is going to be ongoing through the years, not in the next quarter necessarily. If you have that mentality, then your company is going to become AI-first. GO: You’ve told me before that AI is not a tool, it's a culture. Can you explain that? EB: Right now, the biggest obstacle for AI expanding in many companies are the CEOs. I understand the challenges because they fear a lot of reputational risk. You have a board and customers that are going to be judging you. If you don't have a very good AI road map, then it could turn into a failure, and the fingers are going to be pointing at you. I understand that completely. But AI should be a culture within companies, and that starts top down because the CEO has to embrace trial and error. AI is going to fail at least during the first time you start with any automation. It's like when you're building a prompt. We were talking the other day, and you said using AI is not about writing the perfect first prompt. It's that fifth or sixth prompt that's going to get you to the right answer. You're going to be iterating with automation, too. That's something CEOs have to transmit throughout the organization. GO: I think for many tourism organizations, we haven’t even begun talking about the big picture value of AI. From an internal perspective, for example, agents offer a whole new level for optimizing operations with AI. EB: Yes, exactly. When we're in a company and we're facing challenges, the first intuitive thinking is, "How can I solve this? I'm going to Google it.” Now we're transitioning to, "How can I solve this? I'm going to ask ChatGPT.” This is great, but that's not AI-first. That's changing one tool for another. You're still browsing. It's literally the same thing. You're not really using AI. AI-first means, "I do this thing that's consuming 10 hours a week. I do the same thing every time. I spend two hours every day doing the same four steps. How can I use AI to automate this?" That's AI-first because you're using AI to stop wasting time. I think that's the culture we should be striving for. If a CEO injects the whole company with that mindset, then the employees are going to eventually use AI to solve their issues more independently and autonomously. At the end of the day, what AI really does is gives us more time and more of our lives back, and we have not yet understood that because it's new. But it's true, AI is the way for humans to have more life. GO: I want that. EB: We all do. GO: I have this belief that eventually, in any organization, all meetings will be recorded and deposited into a central knowledge base where an AI can summarize everything and connect all the key takeaways. I might have a meeting and someone on the other side of the world has a meeting, and the AI will know we're talking about the same thing. It will see and surface how there's potential opportunity to connect our efforts. It's like one plus one equals three, or more. Do you think that's where we're going and that it will benefit companies? EB: Definitely. It's the most common sense thing to do, but I know it's also counterintuitive because there are many people who would not like to have all conversations recorded. The fidelity, the accuracy of the information, and it all being in one place and uniformly structured, is everything. You can have thousands of conversations and tell the AI, "Go here and search for this specific idea in all the transcripts where we have talked about that." You just need to build the SOPs. Then a human can quality control it and say, "This is right. This isn't right. Maybe we can tweak this, or build on that." GO: I’ve experienced this firsthand where people are vehemently against this idea of all company meetings being recorded. For many it portends that clichéd dystopic future we see in science fiction, where everything's controlled and you have no freedom, right? EB: I can see it too. We must remember that these tools can be turned off. If we let the technology control us, then that's on us. I think at the end of the day, it's about how do you balance the risk and rewards? This is something CEOs are used to. Do you prefer to live in blindness and have an uncompetitive company because you decided not to take that risk with automation? Or do you take the risk and have everything recorded, even though some people are going to say it’s Orwellian in a way, and even though ultimately it's going to improve everybody's life? We have to find that balance, and that’s the CEO’s role to determine what’s best overall for the company, customers and employees in the future. GO: Any last thoughts? EB: I think we are not quite there yet to know for sure the amount of ROI that is going to come from agents and automations. Definitely it is going to be positive ROI. For that, I'm completely sure. What I'm not sure is how do we measure ROI based on the anticipated lifetime value of the process? So much is changing so quickly and it's difficult to see the future. As the tools get better, then the workflow gets better too, so the ROI increases, right? Except, we don't really have models for that. For CEOs, I think, they have to try to envision how they can measure the value of automations now, and how that might evolve exponentially in the future. Greg Oates

What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates CEOs at destination marketing and management organizations (DMOs) are seeking AI guidance specifically tailored to their chief executive roles. A CEO in the U.S. told me recently that current AI education is often too surface level, vague, unstructured, or trying to cover too much ground to be useful for a chief executive. He said, "We've been talking for a while now about how we need AI education targeting leadership, but it doesn't really exist." While destination leaders face many more questions about AI than answers, one thing is 100% clear: CEOs must own and lead their organizations' AI integration across all departments. AI isn't something to outsource or delegate to others, and it's not a "marketing thing" for the CMO to figure out. Conor Grennan , chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, consults with clients on AI strategy from JPMorgan to NASA. I asked him how important it is for CEOs to lead AI education, adoption and integration across their organizations. “CEOs have to understand how to use AI and why; they really have to have felt the delight about what AI can do,” he said. "They also have to see clearly how AI is a leadership and change management challenge, not a tech challenge. Then they need to start out being vulnerable, and be able to say, ‘Hey, I was skeptical about AI. I didn’t understand it, either. But now I can explain the way I learned it and how to communicate why it’s important to help other people understand it.” So why do CEOs need to understand AI? Jeff Bezos answered that at The New York Times DealBook Summit last year. He described how “modern AI is a horizontal enabling layer" that will soon be integrated into every device and digital application in existence. "These kind of horizontal layers like electricity and compute and now artificial intelligence, they go everywhere," he said. "I guarantee you there is not a single application that you can think of that is not going to be made better by AI." Here's the clip: Strategic AI Approaches I met with about a dozen CEOs in North America to find out what they want to know about AI specifically from a CEO perspective. Some leaders are seeking big-picture guidance with a broad overview of high-level strategy. "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” one CEO told me. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" Another chief executive said, “We see three areas of opportunity for AI: Administrative tasks and general productivity; marketing chat, SEO and data readiness; and helping customers find information about our city more effectively.… The two most important things I want to know are how to develop AI policy and how is AI changing SEO." A year ago, most CEOs had a wait-and-see attitude about AI, following how the technology evolved and what their cohorts in other organizations were doing. Today, there is a general consensus among CEOs that they need to invest in AI, but the question is how and where. One CEO told me he knows he needs to integrate AI tools and processes into his DMO, but he has three overarching questions that he wants answered first, at least at a high level: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” Other CEOs are seeking clarity on the basic fundamentals of AI: "I need to understand what are the problems that we're trying to solve with AI. What is the purpose of a chatbot, for example? What am I buying, and what can we as an organization accomplish with it?" And then others just want immediate actionable solutions: "I'm not interested in hypotheticals. Show me five ways I can implement AI on Monday. Give me turnkey AI solutions that work today." AI Data is King Personalized data is one of generative AI’s biggest value propositions. Conversational AI (chat) is the new marketplace, and it’s eating the entire funnel including in-destination engagement. In some cities, AI chat conversations between DMOs and visitors is exceeding 25% in-destination, giving DMOs a way to influence visitor behavior in real time. Also, in some industry segments like tours and activities, in-chat conversations are driving in-destination bookings with partners like GetYourGuide. Everyone is looking for first/zero-party data around that. “We have a low level of proprietary data about who is in our destination and what they’re doing,” asserted one CEO. “We have a few disparate data sources, but we need to connect those, and we want to be able to use it predictively. For example, we're looking at regression analysis to help develop future scenario modeling, and we're looking at AI to help us with that." Another CEO said, “We need data that provides material value for our partners. That’s our mandate. How are our visitors spending money and where? How are they behaving and traveling through our area? How can we help people find our partners in a more personalized way?” And one CEO added, "A key priority for us is figuring out the data equation so outbound messaging can be tailored to a 1-on-1 relationship.” Striving for that direct individual customer engagement has been the holy grail for marketers for decades. The ability to deliver mass personalization at scale is now coming into focus with enhanced AI data curation. National organizations like Destination Canada and Germany Travel have invested millions of dollars in data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to restructure their tourism product data from scratch, capitalize on the data more effectively to rank higher in AI search, and drive incremental revenue to partners. That's what the future looks like. For more information, check out the new Canadian Tourism Data Collective and Germany's Open Data Project . Today, local tourism organizations are starting to see how data structure and content architecture are strategic imperatives for them, too. One municipal CEO explained, "I think it might almost be too early to have this conversation in some areas until AI matures more. One thing I am eager to know now is how do we develop a data lake to structure our own data and messaging to make it easier for AI search tools to find." AI search and SEO are a huge conversation today. During the past year, the #1 question I heard while speaking about AI with dozens of North American destination organizations, their boards and key industry/community stakeholders, was: How do we rank higher in AI search? What happens when AI buries organic content? What’s going to happen to our websites? Are they going to disappear? Is a DMO without a website still a DMO? How do we need to produce content differently? And, what the heck is a data lake? One CEO I spoke with is planning on developing a new website for her organization. She said, "I don't even know what I don't know about AI search, but we need to figure some of that out before we start spending any money." Along with data, defining KPIs for AI integration is a hot topic of debate, and presently there isn’t a complete and codified list of metrics that DMO leaders agree on. That said, perhaps the travel and tourism industry collectively needs to understand what AI is, and what it can accomplish at scale, before attaching too many metrics to it. A CMO told me at DI MarCom Summit this month, “People didn’t ask about ROI with the internet when it first came around. We just knew we had to have it,” because it was a new channel for reaching visitors. Same as AI now. Expanding on that, he suggested that DMOs need to break AI success tracking into awareness metrics and performance metrics, and get that conversation right before anything else. Staff AI Adoption Unlike previous technology evolutions, there doesn’t seem to be as much of a generational divide between early adopters of AI and everyone else. The industry can’t look to Gen Z for guidance about how to use AI to the same degree we once asked Millennials for insights about Instagram. Again, driving AI adoption across an organization begins with the CEO. Once that’s established, the real challenge is convincing department leaders and staff to lean into AI. It's a challenge because there is widespread concern, skepticism and/or suspicion among many staff members across many industries that they’re being asked to learn new technologies that will eventually replace them. Leadership should say to employees that no one can force them to use AI, but the job market will. The data is clear. According to the Linkedin/Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index : 79% of leaders agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with Al skills than a more experienced one without 66% of leaders won’t hire someone without AI skills 60% of leaders worry their organization lacks a plan and vision to implement AI And that's a year old. But, understandably, emphasizing those numbers comes across as threatening. A better strategy for driving AI adoption is finding staff members who are already seeing success with AI, supporting them with access to education and pro AI models, and working out from there. The more employees see their colleagues using AI, the more some of them feel inclined to lean in. Therefore, every DMO needs a comprehensive strategic AI road map that includes purpose, policy, education, integration and a continuous feedback loop across all levels of staff. CEOs need to create a space for that. "We're giving our staff time to play around with AI, but they have to present what they're focusing on and what they're learning to their individual supervisor," a CEO told me. Another added, “We're focusing on staff adoption. But I need you to explain to me what works, how to implement, and what should I watch out for." I'm presently working with our departments at Matador Network to explore a bunch of various AI models to optimize workflows, boost creativity, enhance strategic planning, diversify product, etc. There's a well-communicated mandate from the top that Matador will become an AI-first company, and sooner than later. To help accelerate that, we created an AI task force to bring more perspectives from across the company together to integrate AI into operations. That has been valuable with some immediate takeaways, such as staff is now reaching out and asking for assistance with AI. But it's only a start. "There's this idea that if you can get a core group of people using AI then their attitudes and behaviors will spread organically throughout the rest of the company," said Conor Grennan at NYU. "It doesn't work that way. You have to find the people who have fears about AI and listen to them to understand why. You have to say, 'Yes, AI does suck at that, but here's what it's good at.' You also need to weed out the negative people who are against AI outright. They're dangerous." 5 Key Takeaways Let's go back to that first CEO who wants to know the five big questions about AI. Based on the input from the above CEOs, here's a first stab at that: How can I create AI policy that serves our organization but doesn't suppress experimentation among staff? (Interestingly, policy did not come up that much with the CEOs I spoke with.) How do we need to develop our websites, content and data to rank higher in AI search? How is AI SEO different, and the same, as old SEO? What are existing AI chat platforms accomplishing, how are visitors using them, and how are they influencing travel decision making and purchase behavior? If AI is not just for marketing, what does the ecosystem of AI tools for all departments look like across the organization? And what do they do in terms of increasing productivity, creativity and quality? How do I get staff to buy in? We know AI is an imperative for our organization's competitive advantage and relevance. And we know AI is an imperative for employees for their professional growth and marketability. But how do we get our people to really believe in the need to embrace AI? Greg Oates

Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Royce Chwin, president and CEO of Destination Vancouver , personifies how a DMO chief executive needs to establish and articulate the mandate for integrating AI across the organization. That was the topic of our last Destination AI post where 12 CEOs explained: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . Early in 2024, Chwin addressed the full staff in Destination Vancouver’s office before a session I was presenting there on AI. “We cannot not do this,” he said, stating that the organization needed to adopt AI processes to stay relevant in the industry and increase its value in the community. If Destination Vancouver is positioning itself as an innovative DMO, he explained, then the road ahead with AI was clear. Since then, Destination Vancouver launched a new website fully integrated with AI where visitors can customize how they find travel information. The build was a two-year process requiring an inordinate amount of learning to capitalize on generative AI. The team also developed an AI policy guide that Chwin shared for this post. The comprehensive document is designed to "provide clear protocols that maximize and encourage the use of Al tools where appropriate and safe to do so, while minimizing any potential risks and concerns." The policy guide encourages staff to use AI for "enhancing productivity, efficiency, creativity or decision-making." It defines when not to use AI models and how staff is required to review and validate all AI outputs for accuracy and bias. Also, Stefan Hawes, vp of global marketing, initiated the development of an internal AI Council, bringing together a diverse group of staff to coordinate AI processes across the organization. Chwin shared an internal briefing report outlining the purpose of the Council as follows: It is recommended that an AI Council be established immediately to provide a centralized body for managing AI-related initiatives and to expand training opportunities for team members. The Council will focus on: Setting strategic priorities related to AI Selecting use cases, implementing projects/initiatives/AI software purchases and evaluating their effectiveness Developing a data strategy to support AI adoption and initiatives Developing an AI education, literacy and adoption program Ensuring ethical compliance Fostering cross-departmental collaboration to maximize the impact of AI projects We created a similar AI task force at Matador, and the value of that cannot be overstated to better assess how staff from different departments perceive, and misperceive, AI in general. I talked with Chwin this week to better understand how a DMO CEO can best lead strategic AI implementation across his or her organization. The purpose of this post is to help inform, inspire and influence other CEOs to consider the opportunities of AI in a new light. Greg Oates: Royce, you've been a strident proponent of AI for a couple years now, and yet there are many other CEOs who are still reticent. How did you personally come to decide Destination Vancouver needed to embrace AI? Royce Chwin: The perception still of some DMOs is that we are behind when it comes to technology. We're slow to adapt. We're slow to evolve. You see all these other organizations in the travel sphere around us that are able to move much quicker. They might be capitalized better. They can adjust. They can pivot quicker to take on these new technologies, and they can experiment seemingly without the degree of fear or consternation that maybe some DMOs have. So, I think there's lots of different reasons. For us, I mean, it's day and night. We can't not do that. Our entire ecosystem that we play in has some level of AI being used. Number one is our customers. They’re using AI. So it goes back to that same idea that you and I have discussed many times before: How do we as a DMO stay relevant and how do we show value? AI is a response to answering those two things. GO: In many organizations today, there’s often skepticism and suspicion among staff about how AI might take their jobs, or they’re dismissive of AI altogether. How does your team feel about AI overall? RC: I'm not finding a fear in our organization for using AI. I think it's a different set of challenges. I think there are so many derivatives of AI out there that people don't know what to focus on. Because you can’t and don't need to focus on 40 different AI tools. The question is, what are the best tools that are most relevant to the work that I need to do? That, I think, in my experience is a bigger challenge. My sense of it is that AI can be so overwhelming. It can seem unbelievably complicated. So we had to ask ourselves, do we have the time, resources and skill sets to simply understand it? Secondly, are we asking better questions to understand what in the organization we need to solve, and can AI help? GO: In a previous post, I shared input from 12 DMO CEOs about how they feel about AI. What are you hearing from other CEOs? RC: I was over in Europe recently for Destinations International’s Global Leaders Forum where I was onstage with Sherrif Karamat (CEO of PCMA) and Petra Stušek (CEO at Ljubljana Tourism). We were talking about the importance of face-to-face meetings and so on, and Sherrif made a comment that DMOs are really behind using AI. It was kind of a blanket statement, and he's not wrong. But, I said to Sheriff that I think a lot of DMOs are behind because it's like throwing confetti in somebody's face and asking them to pick the best pieces. They don't even know what they're trying to evaluate, and it’s also moving so fast. In the meantime, our customers are running around us using AI for all kinds of things. And so I think that there's not so much a fear of using AI. It’s more that people are questioning how to respond to the increasing emergence of AI because they’re thinking, “I'm not really 100% clear on the business problem I'm trying to solve that supports my mandate.” For us, and you saw it when you visited, we were really clear on what it is that we needed to do. We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI. “We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI.” GO: I’ve been asserting that CEOs should own and lead AI adoption in their organizations to have the best chance for success. I don't mean lead it day to day. I mean the chief executive must establish the mandate that AI is something the organization is going to invest in, and articulate why and how to the entire staff. Connor Grennan, chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, emphasized to me that’s the only way this works. Do you agree? RC: Yes, I absolutely believe it must come from the CEO because the CEO has to clear the vision with the team. And with something as seismic as AI, and how it’s evolving in our daily life, in our world, I think the CEO has a responsibility to address it and how it will impact the organization. Everyone needs to understand how we’re going to use AI in alignment with our mission and strategic goals, and how it will support the mandate. That's all CEO level. That's the responsibility on my head. Also, I can't imagine going in front of my Board and asking, “Hey, what are you doing with AI? What should we do with AI?” So it has to come from the CEO, but my Board has also enabled me. Like, there's no grief from my Board. Zero. We are fully enabled. GO: You've created the necessary structure to help govern AI integration with your AI Policy and AI Council. Can you expand on the thinking behind those? RC: We developed an AI policy that’s designed to enable people to use AI and not discourage them from experimenting. Obviously, some education is required in terms of proprietary information and those kinds of things. But we're really leaning into this and we're going to assign some time for it to enable the organization to experiment and play with AI without fear of reprisal. Naturally there needs to be governance around it, but governance does not mean stopping creativity. Governance means we’re creating and delivering new opportunities for creativity. There just needs to be structure around that. Also, Stefan came up with the idea of pulling together an AI Council in the organization, which I think is fantastic. We're getting individuals from each business line, including myself, and we’re going to talk about AI, its impacts, what we need to be thinking about, and how we'll improve our website and the organization as a whole. So we're creating dialogue around it to define opportunities. For example, I'm really excited about AI as it relates to all the country market analysis that we do. We've been doing that by spreadsheet, but now we’re exploring AI to provide the insights we need to inform our market planning more effectively. There are lots of different examples like that, but you only discover them by being open to experimenting with AI. Greg Oates

Toronto & Denver Tourism Leaders on the 5 Big AI Questions for CEOs Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates A year from now, the travel and tourism sector might look back and thank Andrew Weir, president and CEO of Destination Toronto , for catalyzing how DMOs move forward with AI. At PCMA Convening Leaders in January this year, I asked Weir what CEOs need to understand about AI at a high level. Numerous other CEOs have told me there’s a complete lack of AI education specifically designed for DMO chief executives. His answer was first shared anonymously in our previous post, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” said Weir. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" At the end of that post I suggested what those five questions might be based on all the CEO insights in there, and I've since been shopping them around to vet them. A few weeks ago, for example, Richard Scharf, president and CEO at Visit Denver , suggested restructuring the questions to create a more logical hierarchy. Now, the first three deal with internal operations while the last two identify external, visitor-facing priorities. Yesterday, I spoke again with Weir, as well as Paula Port, vice president of marketing at Destination Toronto, for their input on the five questions. The goal here is to provide clear structure around AI platforms and processes for DMOs leading up to Matador Network’s collaboration with U.S. Travel at ESTO in Phoenix this fall. Together, we’ll be co-hosting an interactive, multi-station “AI Playground” educational activation during the three days of the conference. Here are the five big AI questions. These will evolve but now we have a foundation to begin building consensus on how DMOs can capitalize on opportunities and navigate challenges with AI today. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The 5 Big AI Questions 1. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? A growing number of DMO leaders say their teams embrace AI for the most part, and many are actively developing basic AI strategy. That’s a significant shift from a year ago. At the same time, there's still varying degrees of cynicism and skepticism about AI in other organizations. I asked Weir about his staff. “I don't feel like we're dragging the team into this,” he said. “It's really more a matter of how people are at such different places with AI. So our goal is figuring out how to channel all their knowledge and energy, and kind of align and unify that, without stifling anyone’s creativity.” Scharf at Visit Denver emphasized that this question should be the first one, because successful AI integration begins with understanding your staff’s grasp of AI and their appetite for leaning into it. “ChatGPT is growing like Zoom did a few years ago so we know we need to use it,” he said. “The first thing we did was survey staff to assess how they feel about AI, and how or if they’re using it. Then we started off with small bites like email. Now we think of AI as a toolkit, and we're continuing to explore what tools are appropriate for different needs.” Port added that AI integration across teams works best with both structured and self-directed learning. “We started by making everything (ChatGPT Plus, Google Gemini) available to everyone, so they were given access to tools and resources, but a lot of this is really self-directed learning,” she said. “What we're seeing now is people have taken advantage of that and moved forward with it. Some maybe a little bit further than others, so maybe we need to address that. I think we still need more use cases and more structured learning because we're not all at the same level in terms of knowing and understanding how to put AI to use.” 2. How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? Destination Toronto was one of the first North American municipal DMOs to develop an AI policy. They began the process by pulling examples from larger government-operated tourism organizations including Destination Canada and Destination British Columbia. “We set up that policy structure first in terms of what we wanted as an organization, and also being very clear that any use of AI was meant to drive business results,” said Weir. “I think we were able to get there pretty quickly because we didn't create a series of regulations. We built a series of philosophies and principles to guide where we go. It was meant to put guardrails around protecting information, while at the same time, stimulate learning and sharing. Because we said to the team that you are free and encouraged to use AI, but there is an expectation that you will share what you've learned.” Port explained further that, “We leveraged existing processes already in place from a content perspective in terms of bias, IT usage, etc. We have an assessment process for any sort of software application that we're looking to use, so we did the same with AI.” (Note: The next GuideGeek Destination AI post will be with Kara Franker, president and CEO of Visit Florida Keys, who is also an attorney. We discussed AI policy at length.) 3. How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? Scharf stated that integrating AI platforms and processes beyond marketing is “where all the work is happening now.” His organization is switching out regular stand up meetings with extended AI workshops and visiting speakers to learn more about AI tools for various use cases across departments. Leadership, he said, including himself, are present at these meetings so everyone is learning together. Weir and Port both addressed this question, saying they need to first explore how Simpleview, Cvent and other tech partners are integrating AI functionality before looking at any new AI platforms. We discussed PCMA’s Project Spark , an AI-native event development tool that includes the new Destinaitor destination sourcing platform. DMO leadership and sales teams are exploring Spark to understand how clients are using new AI software to evaluate, compare and source destinations for business events. Others, like Kara Franker mentioned above, are looking for new AI solutions to optimize their HR and accounting departments, but she said many of the available options presently are only enterprise grade. Something DMOs should really look at, and I’m not sure how/if many already are, but there is proven value in creating custom GPTs for sales teams. GPTs are like mini ChatGPTs designed for specific purposes that anyone with a ChatGPT Plus account can create. For example, a sales rep can build a knowledge base inside a GPT by uploading sales materials, examples of successful bids, product information, pricing, team members, case studies, testimonials and other data. The next step is to develop internal GPT instructions to direct what the GPT does and what it prioritizes. Following that, the rep can then chat with the GPT and ask it to create a customized bid for a potential client that pulls all relevant source materials from the knowledge base that best supports the pitch. I’m imagining the ability to create custom GPTs is going to soon be a standard and required capability for all sales teams. One of the earliest enterprise examples of this was Salesforce’s Einstein GPT, which has since morphed into Agentforce. We use them at Matador because of improved efficiency and quality. GPTs also provide a new option for creative brainstorming, which some salespeople appreciate who don't identify as being super creative. Increases in sales production can be clearly identified. However, there's increasing conversation about tracking success in other departments. When AI delivers clear improvements in efficiency and saves people significant time, how do you measure that? One concern is that people will then just work a six hour day versus eight hours. The common thinking is that organizations will need to adjust productivity benchmarks, but this is a messy conversation. I don’t know enough to comment on that yet, but I wanted to put a pin in it because it’s something we’ll all need to look at eventually as AI scales in the workforce. 4. How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? I was addressing Visit Denver’s Board a while back and one member suggested that DMOs won’t need websites soon because they’ll be replaced by a ChatGPT-like window. I’m surprised by how much this comes up. For one thing, DMOs will always need some kind of online knowledge base for AI search queries. If anything, that will require more content and more comprehensive product information because AI search thrives more than anything on data structure, clarity and specificity. That said, the web user interface will likely evolve considerably. Expect to hear a lot more about how DMOs are developing data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to optimize data structure for AI search. For further context, here's a Perplexity Pro response to the question: "Are tourism boards developing data lakes and warehouses to optimize their sites for AI search?" Weir suggested that this conversation about the future of websites is not unlike what we went through 15 years ago, when people were lamenting the death of DMO sites because social media was deemed by some as the new web. More important, he asserted, is seeing how AI search is evolving and being prepared to adapt strategy. “I think there is a push-pull here between how we lead and where customers are at,” said Weir. “We want to deliver more information through our AI assistant and AI search in general, but customers aren't really there yet. I don't know what the percentage is, but the majority of people are still using Google. They're still beginning an interaction on the web by entering search terms in Google the traditional way. At some point, that's going to flip, right? It's going to be a few percent more each month or quarter, whatever that is. But how far ahead of it do we get? And how do we calibrate? We can try to lead on this, but you know, we also have to stay in step with where our customers are too.” 5. How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? Chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI have dashboards that clearly identify what visitors are asking about in the destination. That helps inform content and product development strategy, and the data is valuable for community engagement. AI chat platforms also operate 24/7 in 50+ languages, which helps DMO influence in-destination travel and spending for a much wider audience than ever before. How to best capitalize on conversational AI, and ultimately conversational commerce, is an evolving topic because we’re still in the early days where travelers are learning they can search with large language models and trust them. ChatGPT has 400 million weekly users but ChatGPT only added full functioning search capability for all users a few months ago. Consumers are just beginning to understand that they can now “talk” to a city. To help accelerate understanding and adoption of AI chat among visitors, Port asserted that the onus is on DMOs to promote their AI chat robustly like any other channel. Weir did that recently by highlighting Destination Toronto’s GuideGeek-powered “6ix” chat platform on LinkedIn, asking, “Ever had a chat directly with a city?” Weir was specifically promoting the organization’s WhatsApp platform, where people can now have a highly personalized, iterative conversation directly with Destination Toronto via the GuideGeek AI integration. The same functionality exists with the other Meta platforms, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. A few hours after Weir's post I received a Slack message from our CTO Stefan Klopp wondering what was going on in Toronto. WhatsApp volume was spiking, he said, and he was asking if Toronto had sent out a press release promoting 6ix, or something. No, it was just a quick CEO social media post. Also, Tourism New Zealand just launched a new campaign in collaboration with “A Minecraft Movie” that integrates GuideGeek-powered prompt questions to trigger further engagement. So, those are just a couple examples of how DMO/NTOs can drive AI chat engagement. The question for Weir and Port though is about the types of questions people are asking in AI chat platforms. Presently, a lot of the chat conversations are more utilitarian, related to queries about hotels, restaurants, attractions, events, directions, etc. So as conversational AI adoption increases, will DMOs focus more on developing content that answers those basic types of questions, like what hotel, restaurant or attraction is highly rated, and how to get there. Or, should DMOs continue to focus mainly on developing what is generally perceived as more inspirational destination and experiential content? "The question then becomes about responding to inquiries versus the inspirational side," explained Port. "Like, all of these articles, all of this content that we serve up, that is not in response to a question per se. It's more packaged to inspire people. I think a lot of that's going to have to exist outside our environments, maybe, whether it's influencers, it's your earned media strategy, it's content partnerships, things like that. That's where I think the inspiration will exist. But we really have to move to being more of the informative one, on our website or whatever a website is. But it needs to be very specific in answering questions. We already see that on GuideGeek." Weir summed up, saying, "I think this ends up relating more to, again, that question of where the customers are. Are we putting ourselves in a position to answer their questions and deliver the information in the way they're looking for it, using AI and the data lake approach? Or, are we curators like we've always been, inspiring visitors with local experiences, or is the customer now the curator by virtue of how they're asking questions today?" Summary These five takeaways are aligned with the five big AI questions. AI adoption begins with talking to DMO staff to understand what the organization is working with. Love the idea about marrying structured and self-directed learning, and being intentional about that with staff. At some point, for AI adoption to scale and continually evolve on an ongoing basis, there needs to be AI leaders in any organization who pick up the torch and inspire their colleagues to lean into AI. Otherwise, things tend to plateau with the same people using the same AI models. AI policy is intended to encourage staff to innovate with AI as much as it's meant to protect organizations. AI is the death of "I don't know," so it can benefit all staff in all departments. That in itself is enough ROI to validate initial investments in AI. The tools can provide a foundation of knowledge and direction for problem solving and strategic planning exponentially better than traditional search. Some organizations, like Visit Greece who we work with, have phenomenal website data structure ideally optimized for AI search. Meanwhile, one CEO told me "Our website is a mess with outdated content and poor data structure. We need to rebuild from scratch with AI search top of mind." Chat is the new marketplace, and AI is eating the entire funnel including in-destination. Moreover, AI chat data provides DMO leaders with insights into what visitors are asking about. Although, I think as chat adoption scales mainstream, the conversations will evolve beyond asking for a good hotel or restaurant. Greg Oates

Why Small Steps With AI Create Big Wins for Tourism Organizations Sep 22 Written By Greg Oates Key Theme: How to Align Strategic Risk Management and Progressive AI Implementation The rush to transform everything with AI has dominated boardroom discussions since ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Yet the most successful organizations aren't pursuing wholesale AI overhauls. They're taking calculated, incremental steps that deliver real value while building capabilities for the future. MIT researchers interviewed senior managers at 21 large companies actively using generative AI. Their findings challenge the prevailing narrative about AI transformation. Companies are deliberately choosing "small t" transformations over risky, large-scale implementations. This approach works particularly well for tourism organizations where customer trust and regulatory compliance matter deeply. Tourism organizations face unique challenges with AI adoption. Customer data privacy concerns run high. Regulatory requirements vary across jurisdictions. Service quality directly impacts reputation. The research reveals that successful companies treat AI implementation like climbing a risk slope. They start with low-risk internal applications before moving to customer-facing solutions. This measured approach isn't about being timid. It's about being smart. Tourism CEOs can build organizational confidence, develop necessary skills, and demonstrate tangible value before tackling more complex implementations. Start With Universal Productivity Tools That Employees Already Want to Use The research uncovered a surprising reality. Employees were already using ChatGPT and other public AI tools without permission. Companies responded by providing secure, private versions of these tools. This grassroots adoption pattern offers tourism organizations a clear starting point. Consider how your marketing team writes destination descriptions. Your operations staff creates training materials. Your finance team prepares reports. These tasks consume hours of employee time across every department. Private AI instances from providers like ChatGPT or Claude eliminate security concerns while boosting productivity. McKinsey built a custom platform called Lilli that connects AI to 40 internal knowledge sources. The result? Seventy-five percent employee adoption in under a year. Time savings up to 30%. Substantially improved work quality. Tourism organizations don't need to build something this sophisticated initially. Even basic AI writing assistants can transform daily work. Microsoft Copilot integration takes this further. Employees can search across company documents instantly. They can pull content from emails, meeting transcripts, and presentations. One manager described it as having "a super search engine" for company information. Imagine your team finding that obscure policy document from three years ago in seconds rather than hours. The beauty of starting here? Minimal risk. Maximum adoption. Employees want these tools. They're probably already using consumer versions. Providing enterprise versions addresses security concerns while meeting existing demand. Your IT team maintains control. Your employees get productivity gains. Everyone wins. Some employees will still seek external tools for specific needs. One product manager uses Midjourney for quick visuals. Another uses voice-to-text tools for performance reviews. Accept this reality. Focus on providing core tools internally while establishing clear guidelines for external tool usage. Deploy AI for Specific Roles While Keeping Humans in Control Once basic AI tools gain traction, tourism organizations can target specific job functions. The key insight from the research? Maintain human oversight for quality control. This "human in the loop" approach reduces risk while capturing efficiency gains. Customer service represents an ideal starting point for tourism organizations. AI can help agents find information quickly. It can suggest responses in real time. It can analyze call patterns to identify coaching opportunities. MIT researchers found AI coaching tools increased call center productivity by 14% on average. New and low-skilled workers improved by 34%. Morgan Stanley equipped financial advisors with an AI assistant trained on over one million internal documents. The tool doesn't replace advisors. It helps them find information faster so they can focus on customer relationships. Tourism organizations can apply this same principle. Help your concierge staff access local recommendations instantly. Enable tour guides to answer obscure historical questions accurately. Support reservation agents with instant access to availability across properties. CarMax demonstrates another powerful application. The company uses AI to generate descriptions for over 5,000 car pages. Manual creation would take multiple humans 11 years. With AI, it takes hours. The 80% approval rate from editorial review proves quality doesn't suffer. Tourism organizations can apply this to property descriptions, tour summaries, and destination guides. Creative teams at Dentsu use AI throughout their workflow. From proposals to budgeting to ideation. The emerging technology director noted employees spend less time on mundane tasks. They create higher-quality content with less effort. Tourism marketing teams can similarly accelerate campaign development, social media content creation, and promotional material design. Finance departments traditionally resist new technology. Yet some organizations successfully use AI for audit reports, regulatory compliance, and fraud detection. Amazon's finance team reports employees shifted from repetitive tasks to critical thinking work. Tourism organizations can start with expense report processing or invoice matching before tackling complex financial analysis. Transform Customer Experiences Gradually With Clear Boundaries Customer-facing AI sits highest on the risk slope. Yet the potential rewards justify careful exploration. The research shows companies succeeding by setting clear boundaries and expanding gradually. Chatbots evolved from frustrating phone trees to sophisticated conversational agents. John Hancock's insurance chatbots handle common queries effectively. Human agents focus on complex issues. Starbucks, Domino's, and CVS expanded to voice interactions. Video interactions come next. Tourism organizations can start with FAQ chatbots on their websites. Add booking assistance once that works well. Expand to voice-based concierge services when ready. Personalization transforms online shopping experiences. Tapestry, parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, uses real-time language modifications. The conversational tone mimics in-store associates. Revenue increased at least 3%. Tourism organizations can personalize trip recommendations based on past bookings. Adjust website content for different traveler segments. Customize email campaigns for individual preferences. Software companies already embed AI throughout their products. Adobe users create and modify images effortlessly. Canva simplifies presentation creation. Lucidchart converts text descriptions into flowcharts. Tourism organizations benefit as their existing software vendors add AI features. Property management systems will suggest optimal pricing. Booking platforms will predict cancellation risks. Marketing tools will automate campaign optimization. The key? Start small. Test thoroughly. Expand gradually. A failed internal productivity tool frustrates employees. A failed customer-facing AI damages your brand. Move up the risk slope deliberately. Build Foundational Capabilities Before Attempting Major Transformations The research revealed an uncomfortable truth. Scaling AI from pilot to production is harder than expected. Data quality issues multiply. Edge cases appear more frequently. Integration challenges compound. Many organizations discovered they needed stronger foundations before pursuing ambitious AI projects. CarMax's chief information officer emphasized data quality. "Good data will give you good results from AI." Poor data produces unreliable outputs. Tourism organizations must audit their data systems. Customer records across multiple systems need reconciliation. Historical booking data requires cleaning. Property information needs standardization. Governance structures matter equally. Who approves AI projects? How do you measure success? What happens when AI makes mistakes? Establish these frameworks before scaling implementations. Small pilots can proceed without perfect governance. Enterprise deployments cannot. Capital One's chief scientist warned against the "gold-rush mentality." Thoughtful, responsible implementation beats rushed deployment. Build the scaffolding to bring everyone along. Tourism organizations should resist pressure to match competitors' AI announcements. Focus on sustainable progress over headlines. Management buy-in proves essential for larger projects. One technology company's AI efforts stagnated until the CEO personally championed them. Small wins build credibility for bigger investments. Document productivity gains from initial deployments. Share customer satisfaction improvements. Make the business case concrete before requesting major funding. Summary: Small Transformations Today Enable Big Transformations Tomorrow The research delivers a clear message for tourism CEOs. Successful AI implementation doesn't require revolutionary change. It requires evolutionary progress. Start with universal productivity tools that employees already want. Target specific roles with human oversight. Transform customer experiences within careful boundaries. Build foundational capabilities systematically. This approach particularly suits tourism organizations. Your business depends on human connections. Technology should enhance these connections, not replace them. Your customers value authentic experiences. AI should enable better experiences, not artificial ones. Your reputation takes years to build and moments to destroy. Measured AI deployment protects what you've built while enabling future growth. The companies studied aren't waiting for perfect AI solutions. They're using today's technology to solve real problems while preparing for tomorrow's possibilities. They're training employees, cleaning data, and establishing governance. When breakthrough AI capabilities arrive, they'll be ready to capitalize quickly. Tourism organizations can follow this same path. Deploy AI writing assistants next month. Add customer service chatbots next quarter. Enhance personalization next year. Each step builds on the last. Each success enables the next. Small transformations compound into competitive advantage. The AI transformation race isn't won by the fastest starter. It's won by consistent, strategic progress. Tourism CEOs who embrace "small t" transformation today position their organizations for "big T" transformation tomorrow. The journey starts with a single step up the risk slope. Greg Oates

How to Develop AI Strategy for Your Organization Oct 12 Written By Greg Oates The 2050 City AI Roadmap provides a high-level strategic framework for how DMOs and other organizations can capitalize on AI to optimize internal operations, resources and knowledge, and ultimately, drive partner revenue. DMOs have all kinds of strategic plans, master plans, business and marketing plans, etc. The 2050 City AI Roadmap outlines the process to develop your AI strategic plan. It defines the big picture outlook for AI as the future of commerce, and it proposes a methodology to help DMO leaders prioritize, organize and navigate how they go about integrating AI across their organization. Presently, we're rolling this out with Visit Mesa , Tourism Richmond in British Columbia, and The Florida Keys & Key West . The three CEOs for those organizations have all agreed to share takeaways and business outcomes with each others' teams to cross-pollinate learning and accelerate AI process integration. That spirit of knowledge sharing and co-learning for me is huge, because we as an industry are all pretty much flying blindly with AI from a macro perspective. Yes, we've come a long way in the last year. Every DMO CEO I talk to these days is now implementing various AI processes and seeing value. However, we're all kind of flying this plane while we're building it at the same time, and we don't really have a destination, or even due north, in mind. The 2050 City AI Roadmap was designed to identify where we're going with this emergent technology that's both incredibly powerful and often highly unpredictable. It also defines how high-end AI chat platforms, like Matador Network's GuideGeek AI , are the tip of the spear for agentic commerce. The following guidelines are based on experience in the workplace to deliver new value with AI for your team, board, industry partners and community stakeholders. Internal & External Direction Every decision related to AI strategy should first be defined through an internal or external lens. Your board members will typically view internal workplace optimization as tactical. Externally, AI integrations that are consumer-facing and revenue generating are usually perceived as more strategic. Internal Facing From an internal standpoint, the focus of the AI Roadmap is on optimizing operations to take advantage of an organization's aggregate of resources and knowledge. Imagine the totality of insights across every team member in terms of their expertise and networks in their communities. AI systems are designed to pool and capitalize on that, but only if an organization's knowledge base is structured intelligently. That means rebuilding your folder structures and files naming conventions so an AI can find everything. According to Slack, workers spend 41% of their time on menial tasks, including endless hours just looking for information. The overall losses related to productivity, quality of work and workplace, and physical/mental health are crazy. So let's start there with AI strategy to address our internal digital dumpster fire. External Facing Externally, from a marketing, sales and visitor/partner engagement perspective, AI strategy begins with integrating a robust AI chat platform like GuideGeek. DMOs have never really had proprietary information on who their visitors are. They have geo-location, credit card spend, event attendance data, etc., which show visitor behavior. But none of those really identify visitor motivations and mindsets indepth. With an AI chat platform, DMOs can now pull analytics showing what visitors are actually asking and what they want to know on an individual and aggregate basis. We launched our new GuideGeek V2 analytics dashboard this past week, which provides deeper, fuller insights into visitor psychographics. That data then informs all kinds of resource allocation decisions related to content development, AI SEO strategy, data analysis, product and destination development, community engagement, etc. CEO Roles AI is best defined as a new digital "co-intelligence" that can communicate, reason and create for the first time ever, versus just another new technology. We emphasize that AI is really a new environment for collaboration more than anything, just not solely among humans anymore. Learning AI is not like learning Photoshop. You can only "teach" AI up to a point, like trying to teach someone how to ride a bike. You can't teach a child how to stay on two wheels without falling in a classroom. He or she actually has to start pedaling, and eventually the child's mind and body basically have a conversation, so to speak, with the bike to grasp the fundamentals of moving forward successfully. Same with AI. The only way to learn AI is to use AI. Helping human teams embrace this new co-intelligence (and it's not like there's a choice) falls under the umbrella of change management. That's a CEO's wheelhouse. It will take more than a few years for many humans to reconcile their minds and values with this new relationship, and it falls on the CEO's shoulders to steward that reconciliation. Likewise, CEOs oversee AI governance, policy and privacy. I've shared before how AI governance should be viewed less like a car brake and more like a steering wheel to inform, direct and accelerate AI adoption and integration. Lastly, only CEOs can scale long-term AI benefits and business outcomes effectively. You can't really delegate this. AI efforts will plateau at times, some or many AI experimentations will fail, and there are always staff members who will drag their feet because they just don't like AI. DMO CEOs are chief people officers and it's on them to create the right culture for scaling AI platforms and processes effectively for everyone in their crews. Agentic AI This is where things get interesting. AI agents and agentic commerce might sound super confusing for many or most staff members. Lots of land mines to watch out for, sure, but even more reasons for us building a macro DMO AI strategic framework. One of the key objectives for the AI Roadmap is to elevate AI agents and agentic commerce as the two interrelated cornerstones for AI strategy, and explain why. Doing so shows the true big picture value of AI, and it drives home how we eventually need to move way beyond training people the basics of prompting. Yes, it's intimidating, but we introduce the labels and contexts relating to agentic AI early on in the process. That gets some people thinking bigger about AI, and it entices the AI champions in the group to start experimenting with agents. AI Agents (Internal) For internal AI strategy, leading DMOs are developing AI agents and automated workflows to address the aforementioned 41% of time that staff members spend on grunt work and trying to find information. They are proven, they work, and most of all, they deliver measurable ROI. We're working with outside contractors at Matador to develop and implement agents and automations for both ourselves internally and for DMO clients. We are already seeing success, and there's been a recent influx among our people asking for agents. It's an amazing thing to see when staff members start requesting new AI integrations like that, proactively. That's when you know your AI strategy is working at least on some level. Agentic Commerce (External) AI agents are also the foundation for agentic commerce. According to Mastercard , "Agentic commerce is a new form of online and mobile shopping, in which an AI agent 'closes the loop' or completes tasks for a user — such as searching for items, comparing options and making a purchase — with limited or no manual inputs needed from that user. For example, while chatting in a generative AI app, you could tell the AI agent, 'Book me a nonstop flight to London for under $600 next week — no red-eyes,' and the agent will review airlines, nearby airports and your loyalty memberships and payment card rewards to identify the best option, purchase it and then share it with you." Just like with AI agents, developing agentic commerce architecture covers a wide spectrum of sophistication and capabilities. Going back to the analogy of flying a plane while building it with no clear final destination in mind, agentic commerce is the point on the map where we want to land. With GuideGeek, we have Kayak, GetYourGuide, Skyscanner and other booking tools integrated into the platform with a click-through UX/UI. Looking ahead, we're working with one national tourism organization to bring some of their national partners' booking engines (air, hotel, tour op, etc.,) into the platform to eventually convert sales in-chat. Subscribe to Mastercard Signals to keep up-to-date on agentic commerce and access intelligence like this Mastercard Payments Trends Navigator report. Staff Training & AI Integration Training staff and implementing AI processes across all departments is really the meat of the 2050 City Roadmap. But none of that should proceed without DMO leadership embracing all the above, and communicating it clearly to all staff. Easier said than done, though. Leadership needs to continually communicate a high-level approach to AI strategy, because it won't really click for many staff (or leadership) at the beginning of this process. That, of course, needs to be married with all the practical training initiatives we're continuing to develop. We've already learned a ton with the present work we're doing training DMO teams. Here are a few very basic takeaways just to start explaining our process. There are obviously many more educational modules following these, ranging from predictive analytics to specific department AI training in areas like HR, finance and legal. Conduct an internal AI survey asking all staff to share their perceptions and usage of AI. Follow that up with small group interviews across the organization, and transcribe everything with an AI notetaker. We use Granola, but there are many others. Also, explain to staff that all meetings regarding AI will be recorded to create an internal knowledge base to identify opportunities, challenges and takeaways over time. Start training with a focus on just the paid/pro models of ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. Some staff feel confused with the sheer variety of available AI tools in front of them. We explain that, at the end of the day, the basics of using AI include an end user, an AI tool, and a knowledge base. Get people on board with that, and then show how most of the AI tools they have access to are similar in many ways. One of the fastest methods to advance AI understanding is showing staff how to create custom GPTs in ChatGPT. Some team members will pick up on these quickly and start integrating them into their workflows right away. These are the people who typically make up your internal AI taskforce. Explain and show how Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot are AI workhorses that connect with the majority of people's daily workflows. However, humans tend to think of those as just the next evolution of search engines. This is mental wiring that needs to be broken. Gemini and Copilot are great/good in some ways, but I've found that training staff on just those three native LLMs first (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) is more effective for seeing the light. Google NotebookLM has a lot of fans. I like to walk teams through it because it's a good way to reinforce what a knowledge base is, like we do with the custom GPTs. Also, the automated audio and video podcasts are crowd pleasers, especially with the new Join function where users can engage directly with the agentic podcast hosts. People don't seem to want to read anymore. This was a rude awakening for us when we first launched the AI Roadmap with a series of online training materials. We now know we need to deliver short video instruction if we want anyone to actually look at the educational content. People love Descript for AI-powered video creation. Once we started showing how to use Descript, we were pleasantly surprised to see how staff really leaned in. Teaching Descript provides a fun break early in the process because people can see pretty amazing results in minutes and wrap their minds around the process fairly easily. Ask all staff to share how they're using AI effectively and where they see AI failing them. Catalogue the case studies and share across the organization to accelerate learning, inspire a healthy sense of internal competition, and track learning over time. Staff members are also often wowed seeing AI agents in action. We use n8n to develop agents, where you can create a lot of basic automated workflows quickly. Once a few early adopters see how agents can take over some of their more tedious, time-consuming tasks, others will jump in. Feedback Loop & Funding/Board Support This line in the AI Roadmap is broken down into tactical internal optimization and more strategic, consumer-facing and revenue-generating sales, marketing and stakeholder engagement. I don't have a lot to share for this section and the following one because our focus to date has been mostly on the above phases. Feedback Loop The reason we record every engagement with AI Roadmap clients is to scale learning, so if one person learns something, everyone can benefit. That will be further multiplied when we starting sharing takeaways across DMOS, and eventually the industry as a whole. Visit Mesa, Tourism Richmond and Visit Florida Keys are eager to lead this initiative, and we plan to launch a new AI thought leadership framework collectively in 2026. Funding & Board Support The spark that led to developing the AI Roadmap happened almost a year ago when a board member for a large DMO told me that she viewed AI integration as merely a tactic. If this work can elevate AI in the minds of board members toward a more high-level strategic imperative, then we'll have achieved part of our mission. There's still some work to be done first though to collect more case studies showing direct AI business outcomes before we can make a more solid case for additional funding for AI integrations. AI Strategic Plan We've produced a mockup of what we think an AI Strategic Plan will eventually look like, but it's too early to show presently. For now, we've identified three overarching pillars, each with potential strategies, action items, timelines and targets. The KPIs are crucial, of course, for scaling AI strategy across the travel industry. Right now, we're thinking the three pillars might look like the following, although this is all up in the air right now: Optimize Internal Operations & Knowledge: The strategies include cleaning up internal folders/files to improve AI outcomes in general and develop AI agents specifically. A lot in here on training, experimentation, overall adoption, success measures, etc. Increase Partner Revenue with Agentic AI: Defining how DMOs develop AI agents to fuel agentic commerce is the big goal overall with the AI Roadmap. Initial strategies in this pillar begin with more low hanging fruit though, such as website redevelopment, optimizing for AI SEO, AI chat integration, etc. Expand Community Collaboration: We're seeing more DMOs take a leading role in AI education for their industry and community stakeholders. The 2050 City Roadmap is perfectly suited for informing how DMO leaders can facilitate community AI workshops and increase the organization's overall relevance and value. Greg Oates

Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Kara Franker , president and CEO of The Florida Keys & Key West tourism organization, was among the first DMO leaders to embrace AI platforms and processes in 2023 when she was chief executive at Visit Estes Park in Colorado. In May 2024, Franker published two papers on AI strategy and policy: From the Base of the Rocky Mountains to the World: A case study through Visit Estes Park’s journey into Generative AI solutions — and how your DMO can carve its own AI path Navigating AI and the Law in the Travel Industry: An Introduction to Legal Implications for DMOs The first paper highlights how Visit Estes Park integrated GuideGeek AI chat into their website and three Meta platforms: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The DMO also branded the chat Rocky Mountain Roamer to give it an identity and bit of personality. The second paper focused on AI policy and data privacy, security and compliance. Franker, who is an attorney, co-wrote that with Roxanne Steinhoff , also an attorney at Steinhoff Law, who leads the firm’s destination marketing and sports tourism practice. I caught up with Franker to see how her perspectives on AI strategy and policy are evolving almost a year later. Greg Oates: You've been leading AI strategy in tourism for almost two years beginning with your work at Visit Estes Park. However, there’s still a lack of AI training today specific for DMO CEOs, and many leaders are presently unsure how to proceed with AI. As a CEO, what’s your take on that? Kara Franker: I'm not surprised that there's a lack of training because there's just so much for everybody to wrap their heads around. I think some people are trying to watch and wait and see. My philosophy has been more of a fall-forward, fail-forward kind of approach. That's why I put the white papers out. Anybody could learn from what we had done, and do it better. You know, a case study is sometimes the best way to figure this stuff out, so that's why we did it. The second paper on AI policy was with Roxanne Steinhoff on the legal and ethical implications of AI. Because when I would go and speak in front of groups, those were always the big questions from the leadership. They don't know how far is too far once you open this can of worms. That's why we got together and started to put guardrails in place that we thought might make sense for people to study, just as a first stab at it. That all launched last summer, so I do think that there's a little bit of education out there but we could definitely use more. GO: What do DMOs need to know about AI policy at a very high level in terms of privacy and security? KF: Employee and client information should be kept private and not uploaded into any AI tools. That could be a big deal, thinking of all the different rules and regulations about collecting information, especially how it's more stringent in Europe than in the United States. That can cause potential problems if you're uploading, say, a client list that has personal cell phones, email addresses or other information that people just don't want out there. So, it's really more about information that's attached to a person. And then, is there competitive data that you don't necessarily want others to have? Possibly, but so much of what we do in the DMO space is public anyways so the lines for that are pretty blurry. I’m trying to imagine a scenario where a DMO is, like, basically hacking somebody else's information through AI. I can’t imagine that’s worth the time and effort, or even possible. GO: A few months ago we were discussing what AI tools might be available for DMO departments like HR and accounting to help with privacy, compliance, efficiency, etc. But everything available seems to be enterprise grade and out of reach for DMOs. So what’s the answer for scaling AI across an organization? KF: I think this is a huge need. I hired somebody from Cisco who’s my new VP of technology and partnerships. She's a total AI nerd like I am, and way more qualified to dive into all this. She and I have been looking at different options to put together, almost like little plugins. We really, really need this. For example, how do we take an AI solution from the legal world to analyze all our contracts so that we don't have to spend as many hours with attorneys, because we really just need a template, right? And then for HR, same thing. How do we organize all our employee files into a much more streamlined and effective system? And then there’s our policies. We're a nonprofit but everything we do is so heavily influenced by County government. We have so many compliance issues, so I want an AI to learn every single piece of County policies so we’re able to compare and contrast what we're doing with those policies. I haven't been able to find anything to help with these things. We've looked at a lot of different options but it's like what you're saying. They're these big enterprise pieces built for law firms or financial people, and they’re all really expensive. None of them fit the mold for improving different operations at a DMO. In my mind, the marketing side is covered, especially with GuideGeek, and there are so many great options now for everything involved with marketing. So I feel like that's been tackled and done really well. But for the operations, we need more. I mean, we’ve just got to keep digging deeper, I think. GO: When you and your technology person from Cisco figure all this out, will you share what you find with the rest of us? KF: Of course, always. GO: Backing up a bit, you were arguably the very first DMO CEO to lean into AI, at least in North America, when you were with Visit Estes Park. How did you convince your board that investing in AI was important at the time, and what were some of your processes with bringing along staff? KF: We were fortunate in the sense that the board was all in and the staff were all in. And I don't mean to make age a part of it, but the staff was a little on the young side and they were all very ambitious. Everybody wanted to try to figure it out. So we made the argument to the board, if we could figure out some of what AI could do, it would make the community stronger and they could take pieces of it back to their businesses. There wasn't really anybody who was against experimenting and trying it out. We made some mistakes along the way and we put that in the white paper. Also, when we first rolled out GuideGeek, which scrapes the website, we found a few holes in our content. There were particular board members who didn't have very robust information about their business, so they got a little bit mad, but not in a, like, burn it down way. It was more of, "Oh, okay, we have some work to do." So part of the AI process has to actually be community outreach. It can't just be about the technology. We have to talk to all our partners and get really robust information from them, so when the AI crawls the site it gets the best possible information about our partners. GO: One thing you did at Visit Estes Park was brand your GuideGeek AI as Rocky Mountain Roamer on your website and three Meta platforms. We use that as a case study a lot, and emphasize that a DMO should promote their AI just like any other channel, right? KF: Definitely. We knew we had to put money behind marketing the tool if we wanted people to interact with it. Traditionally with a DMO, one of your calls to action is to send people to the website. Our new call to action for a lot of our campaigns back then was to send people to the AI, so we called it Rocky Mountain Roamer to help promote and drive traffic to it. And then in terms of KPIs, we wanted to track all the interactions you can see in the backend, but not just how many people used it. We wanted to know how long people interacted with the AI, what their journey was, and what they were asking about because that’s where things get really interesting. GO: After the initial thrill of launching GuideGeek, how did you manage how staff used AI internally? Were there any incentives involved to help spur adoption and experimentation? KF: The incentive for my team was, well, it wasn't really an incentive. It was a requirement. They had to write weekly reports for me about how they tested something with AI, whatever it was. It could apply to their job or not, I didn't really care. So I almost forced them to try AI. But then people started really getting into it. They were getting more and more user friendly with different AI tools, and they would be like, “Oh, I like Anthropic because of this or that,” because they were branching out from just using ChatGPT. So, yeah, there has to be almost like a culture of AI in your DMO for it to really work, and it's on the CEO to create and foster that. Greg Oates

Join Matador Network's AI Playground at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Matador Network, GuideGeek AI and U.S. Travel are launching the inaugural "AI Playground" at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix, August 17-19. The educational space, hands-on demo area, genius bar and live sessions will run all three days during the conference. We are also producing programming specific for travel industry CEOs, along with other sessions dedicated for senior executives, highlighting actionable AI strategies focusing on real world business outcomes. Leading up to ESTO, I'll be reaching out to many of you requesting any AI-related success stories and/or questions you might have for the AI Playground. Looking back over the last two years, it's clear the industry is turning a corner in 2025 when it comes to AI learning and adoption. Many DMOs and their industry partners are now integrating AI processes and platforms across their organizations, whereas last year many destination leaders were still in wait-and-see mode. For those of you still on the fringes, it is our ambition that the AI Playground will plant a flag in the ground showing how AI is now a proven strategy for helping DMOs further deliver on their mandate. "AI is clearly powering the future of travel and how people explore the world today," says Ross Borden, founder and CEO of Matador Network. "We are stoked to be working with U.S. Travel and investing in our industry to produce the AI Playground. AI will become standard operating procedure for every DMO soon, and we're excited to help lead this journey." DMO CEOs on AI Strategy Matador launched its proprietary GuideGeek AI chat platform for DMO websites and social media channels almost two years ago. We now have more than 40 DMOs onboard, and we're expanding the scope of GuideGeek AI with new hotel groups and tour operators joing in recent months. Based on our experience working with municipal, regional and national organizations across the global visitor industry, we have unparalleled insights into how conversational AI is changing the relationship between destinations and visitors, as well as how DMOs operate internally. In preparation for ESTO 2025, we launched this GuideGeek Destination AI newsletter in January to ramp up our industry outreach and further expand our understanding of how DMO leaders are navigating the rise of AI. Here are five stories from the newsletter that inform high-level decision making related to AI strategy, with input from more than 15 CEO DMOs: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI : Our first post with 12 DMO CEOs highlighted the wide range of questions they have. One asked for the five big AI questions he should know about. Another wants practical advice on five AI initiatives that he can implement, like, tomorrow. Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism : CEO Royce Chwin, who helms Destination Vancouver, shared why his organization was one of the first DMOs in the world to dive into AI. Destination Toronto & Visit Denver CEOs on the 5 Big AI Questions in Tourism : Two chief executives, Andrew Weir in Toronto and Richard Scharf in Denver, worked out what they believe are the five big AI themes/questions that DMOs need to focus on, as touched on in the first post. Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation : Newly installed Florida Keys CEO Kara Franker, who is also an attorney, shed light on AI policy, compliance and the need for more non-enterprise AI solutions for her organization. Visit Mesa CEO Launches New DMO AI Road Map : Another visionary DMO chief executive, Visit Mesa leader Marc Garcia is bringing a new level of structure and direction for integrating AI processes and platforms. Next up, Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau, will be discussing AI strategy from a business events perspective. I also met with Cody Chomiak, vice president of marketing at Travel Manitoba, who's really lighting a fire in Canada around AI thought leadership and adoption. He'll be sharing a few powerful AI case studies from his provincial marketing organization, both internal and visitor-facing. AI Playground at ESTO 2025 The AI Playground this year will feature three stations at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge . We will have our Matador GuideGeek team and U.S. Travel staff on hand to guide participants through the space, along with some invited AI experts from around the industry. We'll be digging into a handful of paid AI models including ChatGPT Plus/Teams, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro, Google AI Pro, Microsoft Copilot Pro and Manus. We'll show how AI is best navigated at DMOs by bucketing strategy into three unique categories: Search, Create and Sales. Specific use cases will include content generation and data analysis, AI SEO and AI-optimized web development, AI policy and governance, staff adoption, building custom GPTs for sales proposals, and automated workflows and AI agents, among others. The three stations are: The Prompt Lab welcomes all attendees to come in and test drive various AI models. The interactive, hands-on learning station will have multiple laptops for experimenting with AI tools for people of all skill levels. We'll have a bunch of paid AI models pre-loaded for live demos and one-on-one conversations showing how AI actually works and some of what it accomplishes across different departments. Feel free to bring your own laptop if you like. The Genius Bar is designed for individual and group Q&A about real world AI strategy, implementation and ROI. We'll be collecting all the questions posed to share with the broader industry afterward, so we'll have a couple crowdsourcing boards to help generate new ideas and explore new solutions. Reach out to me if you want to schedule time to talk during ESTO. The AI Theater seating area will host a range of AI-focused dialogues, micro-presentations and a few dedicated sessions designed for CEOs, as well as other senior executives. The programming schedule for all those will engagements be included in the ESTO agenda. Most importantly, all the conversations at the AI Playground will highlight tangible AI case studies and specific business outcomes. The 5 Big Questions About AI One of the best things to come out of all the interviews with DMO CEOs this year is our list of the five big AI questions that chief executives need to focus on. These questions will likely evolve a bit, but for now they're providing direction for how we're developing the AI Playground and how DMOs are moving forward with AI integration. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? I would love to hear your feedback on any the above and how we can make the ESTO 2025 AI Playground as valuable as possible for you and your teams. Reach out at greg@matadornetwork.com . Greg Oates

Visit Mesa CEO Launches New AI Roadmap Aug 25 Written By Greg Oates Visit Mesa in Arizona kicked off a new internal initiative this week to integrate AI processes and platforms across the organization. I worked with Visit Mesa to help develop their new DMO AI Roadmap, which provides a 5-phase strategic framework that most any visitor organization can use as a template. The project officially began this week during Visit Mesa’s spring board meeting to communicate why the organization is moving forward with AI to optimize the DMO’s value for Mesa’s visitor industry and the local community. Marc Garcia, CATP , president and CEO of Visit Mesa, has been eager to start this initiative. He was one of the dozen CEOs who contributed to the first GuideGeek Destination AI story a few months back, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI. For that deep dive into a CEO's mindset regarding AI, Garcia asked: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” The Visit Mesa DMO AI Roadmap answers those questions. “I've recognized that AI is extremely important not only for the world moving forward, but specifically for our industry,” Garcia explained at the beginning of this project. “We at Visit Mesa need to get out in front of it. Even as a small to medium-sized DMO with our budget, we've always taken pride in the fact that we’re typically at the forefront of the latest and greatest in terms of technology, and so this is just an extension of that.” The following is a high-level overview of the DMO AI Roadmap and each of the five phases. However, like all strategic planning, there is a big jump between developing a plan and executing it effectively. This is especially true with internal AI training. In any given organization today, there is often a wide breadth of how people perceive AI and how proficient they are with AI models. It will take time to educate and align everyone around shared benefits for the organizations and staff, expected processes, intended outcomes and success metrics. Visit Mesa AI Roadmap The DMO AI Roadmap is a structured, phased approach for educating staff and integrating AI across DMO departments. The goals for the roadmap are to optimize internal operations, enhance sales and marketing outcomes, inspire staff self-learning, future-proof the organization, and contribute to how well local industry and community leaders adopt AI best practices and benefit from them. There are two imperatives that should be established and agreed upon among leadership at the very beginning. Integrating AI processes and platforms is an imperative for the DMO to ensure its relevancy and long-term impact in the local visitor economy. If leadership doesn’t fully believe that, this strategic framework won’t work. AI proficiency is an imperative for staff members for their future growth and marketability. That said, you can’t really force people to embrace, learn and use AI intentionally, but the job market will. The following phases are highly fluid and some of the processes can be rolled out concurrently. Ultimately, these phases provide structure for effectively and responsibly implementing a new technology that has no precedent. Because of generative AI, machines can now do three things they haven’t been able to do before. They have the ability to reason, the ability to communicate, and the ability to generate stuff based on that reasoning and communication. Meaning, AI is messy. Integrating it into our daily workflows is also messy because it's challenging us to rethink our relationship with technology. But as Kate Yordi, director of marketing at Visit Mesa, said during the board meeting this week, “Finally, we have some direction.” Phase 1: Leadership Alignment & Staff Communication As discussed at length in previous Destination AI posts, the DMO CEO must make it clear to all staff that the organization prioritizes AI because the organization prioritizes being relevant. It certainly helps, as is the case with Visit Mesa, when the CEO is fully backed by the board to invest in AI integration. During the board meeting, one member asked, “What do you need from us, Marc?” That’s a good sign. For the DMO AI Roadmap to work, all leadership needs to not only have a basic understanding of AI tools, they need to actually use them as well on a regular basis. That goes a long way in driving agency across the organization. However, making that happen typically requires some C-suite training to explain the primary AI models more indepth: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot and/or Google Gemini depending on the specific workplace platform(s) the organization uses. Identifying and prioritizing just a handful of AI models like that brings a lot of clarity to the process right off the bat. You see people's shoulders relax when they're confronted with 5-6 AIs versus dozens. (Yes, VEED, Gamma, Manus, Sora, Granola, Slack AI, etc., are all really cool but let's not start there.) A common lament among DMO leadership related to AI is, “Where do we even start?” Leadership should then discuss and begin to answer the five big questions all CEOs face when navigating AI integration, as vetted in the aforementioned Destination AI post about what CEOs want regarding AI education: How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI (who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI) to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and quality of work? How do we redevelop our content and channels to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI for business purposes to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The next step in this phase, at a basic level, is communicating to staff why they’re being asked to embrace AI. The following is not meant to be comprehensive, but a CEO would likely want to articulate: The purpose of the AI Roadmap, guiding principles, and the phases and processes involved How AI integration will take time and people will evolve at different paces It’s ok if everyone feels like they’re building the plane while flying it Everyone is encouraged to use AI and will be supported, but there will also be guardrails in place AI adoption and use cases will become part of employee reviews, but traditional roles, responsibilities and key success metrics are still the priority "How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents." — Marc Garcia, president and CEO, Visit Mesa Phase 2: Staff Assessment & AI Task Force Sitting down and asking staff how they feel about AI and how/if they’re using it is a good way to begin. Depending on the size of the organization, this can be done with every staff member individually or a representative group from each department. Generally people fall into three camps when it comes to AI: 1) Those who are already using AI on a regular basis; 2) those who are curious and have experimented a bit, but they don’t actively engage with AI tools; and 3) those who don’t see much value in AI. This last group can also include people who outright oppose AI, but they make themselves apparent pretty quickly. Data also shows there is often a significant percentage of staff who use AI in secret because they’re not sure they’re allowed to use it for work purposes. The second way to collect staff sentiment and AI capacity is with a blind online survey asking everyone what they like about AI, what concerns them, how they feel about job security, what they want to learn, what they hope to achieve, etc. Everything is anonymous so you can expect a wide variety of feedback ranging from constructive/optimistic to fears of an impending robot apocalypse. Once complete, all the data should be synthesized into key takeaways for leadership and shared with staff to show a high level of transparency right from the beginning of this process. The second part of this phase is developing an AI task force. The value of this cannot be overemphasized. Choose a small group of AI champions from various departments to do three things: Provide direction for stewarding the various processes in each phase as effectively as possible from beginning to end Share constructive and thoughtful input they’re hearing from other staff members about how things are proceeding well and where there are challenges Help scale AI adoption across teams by showing how they’re using AI effectively to everyone else in the organization An internal AI task force or council is invaluable because the members are motivated and they want to learn. Mostly, their enthusiasm and success with AI will begin to rub off on many of their colleagues and inspire self-learning and greater adoption among the teams. But not all. There will be those who disengage, and there can be a significant number of them. Over time, they should be consulted to understand their trepidation, which should then be addressed. This is a challenge I'm having with one organization where a significant cohort are saying they're too busy to learn AI. Meanwhile, the majority of the staff are reporting daily usage with effective results, which definitely wasn't the case a few months ago. And even with those leaning in, the level of improvement and AI Iearning will be slow at times. This is why it’s critical for the CEO and the rest of management to be all-in and consistently participate in staff training sessions to show direction, intention and support. It’s very easy for the novelty of AI training to wear off after the first few months. This is where the AI task force can be instrumental to help maintain overall staff interest and keep engagement levels as high as possible. "Finally, we have some direction." — Kate Yordi, director of marketing, Visit Mesa Phase 3: AI Policy & Investments Developing an official AI policy and governance manual accomplishes two primary objectives: It protects the organization against legal and financial liability by establishing how all employees are required to use AI responsibly. It encourages and gives license for staff to proactively experiment with AI because there are clear guidelines in place about how to do so. There are many DMOs who have created AI policies and are willing to share with the rest of the industry. These are typically not lengthy documents (3-4 pages) nor full of legalese. Generally they’re written so every single employee can understand everything in them. Sections in these policies often include: Positioning/Purpose Statement: Expresses how and why the organization needs to be intentional about implementing AI processes Primary Objectives and Intended Outcomes: Defines the business case for how the organization is attempting to deliver on its core mandate of driving revenue to local businesses in alignment with community priorities Guiding Principles: Establishes the principles of responsible AI use in alignment with the values of the organizations related to themes such as inclusivity, bias, authenticity, veracity, collaboration, knowledge sharing, etc. AI Definitions: Provides clear explanations of AI terminology used in the document and workplace AI Tools: Identifies specific AI models that the organization provides access to Data Input: Dictates clear rules about what employees can upload into AI models and what they can’t upload, such as personal information of any person Monitoring: Defines how the organization reserves the right to monitor AI practices Training & Support: Defines opportunities for professional growth and learning AI on an ongoing basis There are other items that DMOs might include in the above list, and they vary depending on how HR, financial and legal departments interpret AI governance, but it serves as a foundation. One key consideration for DMO leadership when it comes to policy is identifying which pro AI models to invest in. Paid AI tools provide higher levels of privacy and security because AI companies don’t train on them, or at least there’s the choice to select that option. Many DMOs, for example, purchase annual subscriptions for paid ChatGPT Team accounts ($25 per employee monthly) for staff to use for work, which is a first step for protecting the IP and other interests of the organization. Other paid AI models are then provided to specific departments based on need and the specific attributes of the tools, such as Claude for marketing and social media staff because many consider it the best AI for content creation. Phase 4: AI Education & Implementation This is the most important thing in training teams to embrace and use AI effectively. You want to foster an environment where structured learning evolves into self-learning. That’s the only way this scales. When staff members with little experience in AI start exploring how to use AI on their own, and they start helping their colleagues see new ways to use AI, that’s a pretty special thing. From an education standpoint, the DMO AI Roadmap begins at a high level defining AI’s place in online history. AI is the third transformational shift since the PC was invented, including: The mainstream web/internet in the 1990s; the evolution of mobile/social/cloud and apps in the 2000s; and gen AI in the 2020s. These are the only three times when big tech went all-in and pivoted their business models around a new technology. I then break AI training into the following buckets, and again, this is all very surface level and not meant to be comprehensive. Also, creating engaging demos are everything, and that's not also easy because AI demos can be a real slog sometimes. But, showing how different AIs provide real value is key for people to internalize their learning and use it more intuitively over time: Explain how pre-gen AI tech is deterministic and gen AI is probabilistic, which messes with a lot of people’s minds. Gen AI outputs are based on statistical patterns and probabilities, just like the human brain processes ideas and information. Traditional tech is based on absolutes, delivering the same output based on the same input. Old tech is about information. AI is about knowledge. Spend a lot of time on this with workshops and demos. Highlight the capabilities of only three AI models to start: ChatGPT for brainstorming and planning; Claude for writing and data analysis; and Perplexity for conversational search. The other two, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, are more general purpose. They also do amazing things (Gemini 2.5 Pro is great for reasoning), but focusing on the first three will provide direction at the beginning so people don’t get overwhelmed. At the very minimum, leadership should have a basic understanding of those three. Explain how AI search isn't 100% perfect but it's a 1,000% better than old search. Define how DMOs and all brnads are redesigning their websites and content strategy to optimize for AI search, and the basics of AI SEO . I would argue the most important thing for using AI is really understanding how generative AI = conversational AI. It's a dialogue. It's called "chat" for a reason. This is where I’ve heard the most positive feedback from teams I’ve worked with. It happens when people move beyond the Google mindset—where search is one and done—and they see the real value of iterative conversations with AI models that evolve with each exchange in the discussion, just like a human conversation. This also removes some misperceptions about how to prompt. Yes, there are some basic rules about how to prompt well. But beyond that, it’s vastly more beneficial to explore AI conversations further with thoughtful follow-up prompts that flow logically and organically to achieve the best results. Explore how the real value of AI extends beyond just efficiency and productivity gains. That's a dangerous dialogue with staff who can construe that as leading to more work or being terminated over time. The bigger value and better narrative is how AI increases creativity and knowledge, and how those both influence overall quality of work, marketing effectiveness, sales productivity, staff culture and pride, job satisfaction and growth opportunities, etc. Really dig into the advanced features of the paid models: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro. Aside from the added security and privacy they provide, they offer functions not available in the free models and their outputs are significantly better. ChatGPT Projects and custom GPTs, Claude Projects and Perplexity Spaces are where the magic happens. Create an environment where staff members are eager to share their successes with AI with the rest of the organization. This feedback loop is critical for steering education and driving adoption, and it’s one of the most important roles for the internal AI task force. AI-training meetings can be highly effective during video calls but they often have the greatest impact during in-person workshops. Also, make sure to give staff a specific amount of hours during the week to develop their AI skills. Explore options for AI chat platforms and the benefits they provide for visitors and local industry partners. I work with Matador Network, which developed the industry leading GuideGeek AI chat platform. The feedback from 35+ DMO clients is impressive and irrefutable, but there is still much work to do educating visitors and industry about AI chat strategy and their benefits to continually increase adoption and business outcomes. The DMO AI Roadmap also provides guidance for developing various learning and engagement formats: Schedule weekly or bi-weekly meetings specifically, and only, for AI training with both internal and external people sharing insights Create a library of AI educational materials for staff to reference Start a weekly internal AI newsletter to share how teams are using AI Start a Slack or similar channel dedicated for AI education, AI news updates, knowledge sharing, etc Start a weekly and optional one-hour AMA meeting for everyone to ask everyone else questions (highly effective) Create a regular schedule for staff to report back to leadership or department heads about how they’re using AI and what they’re achieving with it Phase 5: Success Tracking I kick off every AI presentation identifying the three AI models mentioned above—ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity—followed by the assertion that, "AI is the death of 'I don't know.'" That is arguably the biggest ROI for integrating AI in a DMO or any other type of organization. There are few questions that are too complex or too intimidating for DMO staff to approach with confidence and conviction if they know how to use those three AI models effectively. I shared an example previously where I used Perplexity Pro to educate myself about how board governance is evolving . That for me was something I knew was out of my realm of expertise, but now I feel I can speak with some semblance of authority about that to any board because of AI. Before gen AI, I dismissed board governance as one of those things I'd just have to leave in the dark. That said, trying to explain how AI helps staff become more self-reliant, where they can always build a foundation of understanding for anything to empower themselves, only goes so far with a board. They're looking for more quantitative KPIs. Here are just some examples of that in a DMO context. In 2025, defining KPIs for AI integration is an evolving science, and we as an industry are still figuring a lot of this out. Therefore, this list is nowhere near comprehensive and it will evolve, but we have ample data today to validate the following: Using AI for search and content development saves significant time and increases opportunities for higher output and increased creativity for producing blog posts, social media, videos, marketing campaigns, etc. Developing custom GPTs (in ChatGPT Plus) for group sales is a proven strategy for creating better, more customized proposals in much less time. That gives sales staff more time for brainstorming and prospecting leading to higher production. That's a fact. In this case, group sales people are actually pumped to try a new technology. Using AI for regression analysis and scenario modeling increases the accuracy of how DMOs predict visitor volumes year-round, event attendance, economic impact, etc. One of the biggest conversations in DMOs today is how to develop content and websites to rank higher in AI search. Developing best practices in AI SEO leads to higher traffic. That is a core mandate for any DMO, and no DMO can afford to ignore that over time. AI chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI are driving real business. As described in PhocusWire in March, New York City Tourism + Conventions launched its GuideGeek-powered "Ellis" meeting-specific AI chat in January. ROI to date: 100% increase in traffic to the meeting planner website, 800+ AI-driven queries in the first month, 50% growth in newsletter sign-ups, and 10% increase in time spent on the site. Summary The AI train has left the station and it's gaining steam. The DMO AI Roadmap is the next logical step for helping DMO CEOs and their teams integrate AI processes and platforms. As Visit Mesa's Kate Yordi said, "Finally, we now have direction." That's a big deal for DMO staff to feel that way. Generative AI has been with us for more than two years now, but a structured and phased approach for integrating AI across DMO departments has been the missing piece. Visit Mesa's DMO AI Roadmap is going to evolve as the team works through the process, but at least now there's a vision and scope. Visit Mesa CEO Marc Garcia and the board are fully committed—a critical first step for embarking on this journey. Also, this strategic framework for how DMOs approach AI is going to underpin the interactive AI Playground activation at U.S. Travel's upcoming ESTO conference in Phoenix, August 17-19. U.S. Travel and GuideGeek are partnering to develop educational programming for the hands-on AI training experience and series of thought leadership. Greg Oates

How AI Improves DMO and Community Master Planning Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Many DMOs are developing 10-year destination master plans to optimize their visitor economy in alignment with local community priorities. I've participated in producing dozens of them from Miami to Mesa. They often take as long as a year to complete because there's so much focus on community engagement in various formats: interviews, focus groups, town halls, surveys, visioning sessions, etc. The tourism industry talks about the importance of community a LOT. However, when you're working with a DMO, you never really dig into what actually moves the needle across so many endless community demands, not on a tactical and hyperlocal level. You're not really held accountable for any measure of success when it comes to community-specific initiatives, ranging from improving City Hall permitting processes for small businesses to tracking the movement of unhoused. A master plan needs to address those and amplify those kinds of pressing needs for the destination overall. The expectation is not really to fix them. That’s not the role of a DMO. It's a whole different ballgame when you're developing a long-term strategic framework for a community organization like Near Southside, Inc . in Fort Worth. Success and being accountable for fixing things is expected. Located at the periphery of the downtown core, Near Southside is the most interesting community in North America right now. The ex-industrial district can be loosely compared to Austin 20 years ago with the same cultural DNA and similar community values, based on a fiercely protective love for local, creative and independently owned small businesses. That's under threat. In the last few years, as Near Southside evolved into the coolest 'hood east and west of the Pecos Line, real estate prices are rising commensurately. We all know how this story often ends with the encroachment of national brands sanitizing the soul of a place that made it attractive in the first place. Near Southside is intent on rewriting that story. AI Processes for Strategic Planning Here's where AI comes in. Because of the multitude of overlapping challenges and evolving dynamics in the community, our team needs to crunch and debate a ton of qualitative and quantitative data. Addressing gentrification touches on so many aspects of how communities operate. Therefore, we are over-indexing on community engagement to get as many perspectives as possible to identify how the community best evolves in the face of rapid change. The amount of inputs we're getting is substantive, and we want to inventory all of it as thoroughly as possible to build a super comprehensive knowledge base for the AI to cull through, connect dots and output insights. Every individual zoom call with stakeholders is recorded with Granola AI, which produces full transcripts but the summaries are too light. So we created custom GPTs with instructions for everything we want in the summaries, including comprehensive overviews, key takeaways with detailed context for each, the most insightful quotes related to those takeaways, and all action items that stakeholders recommended. With the GPT, we can fire full transcripts into the chat, press "enter" and receive highly valuable, high quality and uniform summaries almost immediately. We're doing the same with the focus groups but the custom GPTs require a different set of instructions. The two-hour transcripts capture the conversations with 10-20 stakeholders convened across specific industry and community segments. For those, the GPTs bucket corresponding high-level takeaways and tactical action items related to the same theme. That has immeasurable value because these conversations are all over the place. It's great working with locals who are so passionate about where they live and how, but that means you're getting feedback from a firehose and someone taking notes doesn’t capture all the nuance. Using custom GPTs to produce these summaries and populate takeaways is as good or better than any team could do manually. Everything is stored in Airtable. Forget Google or Microsoft cloud platforms. Airtable is an AI-powered, relational database/spreadsheet beast for organizing data and automating basic workflows. The tables combine all project information in one place, such as a running list of pending/completed interviews and focus groups and their AI-generated summaries. Airtable can then auto-generate a summary of the summary in the same table for clients to easily review everything being collected on a daily basis to whatever degree they prefer. Once you use Airtable, you'll never look at Google Drive the same way again. I've never had so many insights so well organized, so thorough and so easy to share with a team and client to help inform each project phase. The client loves the transparency, immediacy and structure, naturally, versus waiting for the next weekly update to read a few bullet points in a PowerPoint. Here's the thing. Because we've been so intentional about collecting such a high quality and comprehensive volume of feedback, we have a motherlode of a knowledge base for AI to work with. We can then enter all that in bulk into Google NotebookLM or ChatGPT/Claude Projects to pull out anything from high-level aggregate takeaways to anything super customized or tactical. For example, the client was interested in hearing specifically just what developers had to say about gentrification. I wanted highlights related to anything discussed regarding City Hall processes. It’s super easy to pull reports together for those and anything else. Ultimately, you can use AI to deliver an outline, a strategy map and a very rough draft of a destination master plan. All you need to do is combine all of the above together, plus PDFs of all relevant public and private planning documents, PDFs of all relevant case studies and best practices, and detailed instructions about the purpose, elements, structure, etc., of the plan. People will disagree, sure. I'm not dismissing the expertise of people who put these things together, because they bring deep context to every conversation and decision made during the development of a master plan. Everything happening now in Near Southside has happened somewhere else. When you can bring takeaways from those places to any present situation, it helps provide direction for everyone in the room. Again, I’m not saying that AI is replacing humans. People get all kinds of worked up over that, especially in travel and tourism. I am saying you can create a better, more strategic and more informed master plan in a much more streamlined fashion when you employ AI strategically to better prepare a community for the future. That's just a fact. I have four more community focus groups today in Near Southside. The expectation among everyone is that their contributions will make a demonstrable difference in their neighborhood. We can’t just speak to the challenges. We need to fix them and our processes with AI are giving everyone more confidence that we can deliver on that. Wondering how many DMOs are interested in employing similar AI-first strategies to get a better handle on how to help their communities. Greg Oates

How Visit Richmond is Using AI to Sell More Conventions Aug 2 Written By Greg Oates DMO CEOs want specific use cases for AI showing how they drive measurable business results. Here's a great example for capitalizing on AI to drive meetings and conventions volume from Lauran Peoples , director of sales marketing and business development at Visit Richmond in Virginia. Peoples works in the organization's 13-person sales team and reports to the VP of sales. Her role has three core functions: She is the main liaison between the destination sales and marketing departments; she develops and leads campaign strategy for the sales department; and she works with her colleagues to optimize strategic partnerships. Peoples' role is somewhat unique as a liaison between sales and marketing in that she lives on the sales side, versus marketing. She also stands out in our industry as an emerging voice in AI innovation. If you're going to U.S. Travel's ESTO conference this month in Phoenix, look for her and me working in the show's inaugural AI Playground educational activation. Greg Oates: Can you explain your role at Visit Richmond, specifically in terms of how you bridge the sales and marketing teams? Lauran Peoples: It's becoming more common in DMOs for sales teams to have a marketing liaison, but usually that person is based on the marketing team and is mostly assigned to sales to help with creative. The issue is when that marketing liaison is based on the marketing team, they don't have much exposure to the field and what's happening out of market with your salespeople. Our sales team has 45 trade shows this upcoming fiscal year, so they're traveling almost every week. With my situation in Richmond, they're getting real-time data and downloads about what's happening in each destination, so that gives them more authentic conversations to engage planners. Not having someone assigned to a team like that creates a huge disconnect and leaves opportunity on the table. GO: Tell us a little about your journey with AI. LP: I've been working in hospitality for 20 years. Last year, I heard some younger people on the team talking about ChatGPT. So I was like, okay, I don't know anything about that. I went to PCMA Convening Leaders in January and the opening session was all about AI. I remember sitting there feeling like a dinosaur. Feeling very behind. I realized this is a lot more serious and widespread than I thought, so I left and tasked myself with using ChatGPT once a day. Initially, I couldn't differentiate how it wasn't like Google. I was asking it how many tablespoons are in this or that, kind of thing. Since then, my understanding of AI has progressively increased around more complex and comprehensive capabilities. It has streamlined my productivity, but more importantly, AI has become a thought partner for me to bounce all these ideas and scenarios around that I didn't have before. I think that a lot of people are adopting AI and using it as a communications assistant, or a writing assistant. But the part for me that's really exciting and valuable with AI is analyzing and aggregating data and getting it to show you things that you need help with, like sales. GO: Can you share an example? LP: Sure. I took five datasets: five years of lost business, five years of definite business, and three marketing reports from different campaigns we were running with outside agencies like Sojourn and Digital Edge. Those campaigns give us demographic insights because we were targeting certain areas. I also grabbed our sales deployment sheet, which tells you who has what market. I uploaded all of those into ChatGPT and asked it to identify the top five locations for each of our managers based on their market segments. Some results weren't surprising, but there were a few that popped up like Orlando that we've never traditionally considered. When I asked ChatGPT why Orlando, it showed how the city has a large hobby market. It turns out there are a lot of hobby conventions that meet in Orlando. After I compiled the top five locations for each manager, I asked ChatGPT to give me the top five accounts in each of those locations. Then I asked for unique selling propositions for each of those accounts as to why Richmond would be a perfect fit. Finally, I asked it to rank those five destinations based on probability of success. GO: Have you seen any of this result in new business opportunities? LP: Yes. One location that showed up was Philadelphia. Richmond is four hours from Philadelphia, but like Orlando it hasn't typically been on our radar. However, based on the data from ChatGPT, Philly came up as a recommendation. So we sent one of our sales managers to Philadelphia, and she ended up hosting 18 planners, including some who drove from over an hour away to see her. She got such a great response that I had to jump in and go with her because she couldn't host 18 clients by herself. AI has now informed our sales strategy for Philly, and the region is now part of our dedicated sales strategy. We've allocated funds for that sales manager in Philly to join chapters of organizations like MPI and PCMA. So that's how we know there had to be some accuracy to our approach with AI. GO: How do the sales managers feel about you doing this AI analysis? LP: They appreciate it. It's a balance because most sales managers at DMOs aren't entry level; they've been in hospitality for a long time. This is a new process and a new tool for them. Some have destinations they like to go to over and over because they're successful there. But my role is to support business enablement and sales enablement to help them do what they do better and uncover new business. So how we're using AI provides them with additional actionable research. GO: I think one of the most underrated strategies for AI is developing custom GPTs in ChatGPT to help sales teams develop more customized and effective proposals more quickly. Are you building those at all? LP: Yes, definitely. About a month and a half ago, I programmed a GPT for the sales team called "Prospecting Partner." It's trained on our sales collateral and all our information, so it knows our convention packages and understands our jurisdiction and seven localities. The sales managers have been using it to prospect smarter. I included suggested prompts to go beyond just, "Give me a prospecting email." We can get really specific, like, "Help me re-engage an association planner who just lost grant funding." It also provides strategies specifically related to that, and then you can ask how to execute those strategies. So, for example, we know from reports that finance and insurance is an opportunity market for us. It's a small percentage of our current business but it has the highest average daily rate, which makes it very attractive to our hotel partners. So our salespeople are asking ChatGPT for ways we can develop business in the finance and insurance market, and really dig into that. Ultimately, AI is helping our sales team think bigger, smarter and more strategically. I've asked the sales team if they found this helpful, and, you know, salespeople are not an easy crowd. They said yes across the board. With the ChatGPT Enterprise version, I can't see their exact prompts due to privacy, but I can see the number of conversations they're having with the tool, so I know they're actively using it. GO: How are other people on your team using AI? LP: My two direct reports are our CRM database administrator and our sales coordinator. My sales coordinator does support work for the entire team, so she's using ChatGPT a lot for ideation, like when a sales manager needs an itinerary to entertain clients in Chicago. My CRM database administrator uses ChatGPT as a communication assistant because sometimes analytical personality types can benefit from exploring more communication nuances. She's also started incorporating it into data cleanup, using it to analyze reports and suggest what's missing or what would be beneficial. She uses it to help fill in gaps and identify what's not being asked or said. GO: What are some of your future plans with AI? LP: We're launching microsites for destination sales and sports, and I think it will set a model for the rest of the organization because we’re replacing our website from pre- to post-AI, like most DMO sites these days. We're currently writing copy for the microsites, and I've been getting into structured data and semantic clarity. You don't search ChatGPT or prompt ChatGPT with the same language you search Google, so content has to be written differently. Previously, you'd go to Google and say "restaurants near me." Now with ChatGPT, it's more of a conversation, so you'll say, "Hey, I'm in Scott's Addition historic district in Richmond with my kids, and we're looking for a vegan restaurant." That semantic clarity allows AI to respond with much more specific answers. I think we need to anticipate AI searches, as opposed to Google searches, in how we write content. Everyone is subconsciously expecting a personally curated experience today. When I go on Amazon, I'm expecting it to make connections that I like this, so I might also like this, without me having to tell it certain things. That's where we have to move towards, or we get eclipsed or become obsolete, especially if we're just thinking of ourselves as brokers for a destination. Greg Oates

Visit Phoenix CEO on Leading AI Strategy and Being Chill About It Jul 28 Written By Greg Oates I learned a lot about how DMO leaders can confidently integrate AI processes into their organizations after speaking with Ron Price, CDME, president and CEO of Visit Phoenix. Price is somewhat new to AI but his staff have been doing cool things with various LLMs for a while. He says his primary role with AI is providing the Visit Phoenix team with an enabling environment for success built on a culture of trust. Price accomplishes that by inspiring everyone to experiment with AI, be aware of the liabilities, share their wins, have fun with it, reach out to others for advice, and most of all, validate everything. Although, what stood out for me the most talking with Price is his calm and clear approach to AI, basically inferring (in my words, not his)... "We got this. We might do something amazing today with AI or we might not, but either way we're fully committed to seeing what it can do. We're also going to figure this AI thing out by collaborating with our many DMO industry friends. Because AI is going to change everything in a hurry, and we at Visit Phoenix are not going to be caught staring out at a Sonoran sunset while the world passes our city by." That's the vibe I got. That's leadership. That's what being a CEO means, at least for me. AI is confusing, sure, and CEOs have to worry about their boards and electeds. The thing is, we're more than two and a half years into generative AI now, and it's not going to wait for CEOs to decide if they can "trust AI" or not. I think we can all learn from Price a few things: We can de-escalate all the hubris and hand-wringing surrounding AI by being open to possibilities and having a clear set of principles, especially related to responsible AI use and verification. You can have fun with AI and focus on business outcomes at the same time. The DMO industry needs to collaborate and share best practices more intentionally to accelerate AI education, innovation and integration. We must encourage DMO staff to use AI today so they can steer the future of our industry tomorrow. Price likes talking about AI. I would encourage any DMO CEOs on the fence with AI to reach out to him. Greg Oates: Ron, how do you use AI? Ron Price: I use AI every single day, going back now about a month and a half. I'm just fascinated and interested in what it's able to do. I wouldn't say I'm an early adopter, of course, although there are some people who aren't even on it yet. Me personally, I use it for everything, like if I'm curious about something that's happening within the region. Or maybe I want to quickly compile a lot of data to help solve a problem or answer questions as I get ready for different meetings. More or less, my brain is always just firing, like, "What if we tried this or that?" And so, this year has been a cool realization about what AI can do, and seeing how it's pulling all the sources through to validate what it responds with. We have also integrated AI with Microsoft Copilot. We pay for everyone to have access to that, and then we also have a ChatGPT Team account for our staff. GO: Where else are you seeing value with AI at Visit Phoenix? RP: In our world, it's marketing, it's content. I love being surrounded by people who can write really well. It's an art to me, and I don't possess that art. It's like someone playing the piano. I'm in awe of that. So AI gives people the ability to write better, and it's okay to lean into it. Don't feel threatened by it. AI is able to give you that one golden nugget, or it suggests that one good idea that can really help someone when they're writing. Here's the fun part. Every day, we're learning something unique. We have the Cronkite School of Journalism in Phoenix, and some of the students are here. We kind of give them free rein, and we're also teaching them at the same time. The way that they use AI is amazing. It's fun to walk down the hall to see them because I'm always like, "How did you write that? How did you create that image? How did you pull that data and research together?" It's just a different generation. We're also seeing where our people are asking AI things like, "If I'm a salesperson, how do I influence a group to come here in the middle of the summer for a conference? Why is it fun to be here for a conference when it's 110 degrees out?" And what does AI have to say? Well, one thing that's great about, say, Grok, for example, it's pulling from all these little texts on Twitter, or X. They're from people saying, "Hey, I know it's summertime in Phoenix but look what I got to do." Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use. GO: Does your staff using AI increase your organization's impact in the community? RP: We not only focus on growing tourism in our community, but we're also joined at the hip with economic development. We look at our role as we're here to build a better community through tourism. And so, when you think about utilizing all the data out there, we always ask ourselves, "How could AI help us consolidate that data and crunch the numbers faster to give us a clearer picture of what we think we know?" For example, how much business that comes in through our leads touch our priority sectors? And of those sectors, which ones align extremely well with what we're doing here at Visit Phoenix? Is it semiconductors? Is it bio-med? Is it something that leans into the engineering side because of what ASU and the Department of Defense are doing? We've seen we can go back and look at the data and get a better picture of those things now. Also, as an example, we have a high propensity to book business around the semiconductor space. So we're utilizing these AI tools to quickly do research like, "Give me a list of the top semiconductor conferences that take place around the world." The responses are quicker and the results are better versus doing a traditional Google search. It's able to pull from a lot of different sources, so that's another way we're using AI. “Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use.” GO: How do you define the role of a CEO to guide a DMO forward with AI? RP: Setting up the rules of the game is important. There are areas of liability we have to be aware of about what you can and can't be pulling in. Those are the types of things we needed to figure out, you know, basically, "What is our rule book for using AI?" I like giving people the ability to use AI as they will. I think it works best whenever people know that it's a tool we want them to utilize. And if it can help us at the end of the day tell a better story, be smarter as we go after business, and be smarter with our analytics to help build our marketing strategy stronger, then use it. I try to build a team of leaders so they're CEOs of their own divisions, and I want them to be thought leaders in their areas. Also, I think AI enables us to get to answers quickly, but, and this is important, how do we validate those answers? We're really good at Visit Phoenix when it comes to validating answers, but we're usually doing it by going the long way and understanding how AI responded like it did. We're reading source by source by source, and then we kind of come to our own conclusion. It's like we're not just focused on the punch line of a joke. We can also tell you the structure of the joke. You always have to validate. We get excited about using AI because it just puts us in a new position. I think it's good to have a CEO that supports that, but that support comes from a trust within the organization. I trust that people are going to utilize AI to help make us better. GO: What keeps you up at night regarding AI? RP: My fear is how do we control and ensure that someone isn't producing something negative on our behalf, and then launching it to the world, and using this incredible tool to hurt us? Because there are people that are extremely gullible who believe whatever they're looking at. That's kind of where my brain goes sometimes. It's only because of what I've already seen these tools can do. I think across the DMO industry, we'll have some "ahas," especially when we get together in various forums to exchange ideas. We need to be talking with each other about, "Here are some things that work really well with AI, and here are the headwinds." And then, "These are the things you need to realize could happen with AI, and here are some ways you can mitigate those problems." The more we can learn from others about how they're using AI, the better. I think what you're putting together about AI strategy with all your insights is going to be extremely valuable. GO: Thank you. So, what are you thinking about next with AI? RP: As AI continues to grow, and we've talked about it here internally, what is the value of a website? In fact, we just started our next fiscal year, July 1. Website visits is no longer a key metric that we're going after. As a leader, I like knowing what's three steps ahead. We currently have these tools, but how are they going to change the way we make decisions going forward? At some point, a lot of what we're talking about now is going to be white noise. And what then? It doesn't mean our jobs of promoting a destination change. It means we're going to get so much better at telling our story through so many different avenues. I believe that our reach is actually going to broaden. We're still going to be responsible for promoting our destination and selling our destination, but how we tell the story and how we show the story is going to change as these tools evolve. Back in the day, a lot of us were reading about Moore's Law and how things just keep improving and getting cheaper, especially in technology. Now we're moving into a space where the rate of growth with AI is going to be something we've never seen before. Greg Oates

German Convention Bureau Leader on the Future of AI-Powered Meetings Jul 27 Written By Greg Oates After the global financial crisis ended in 2011, a few cities and nations around the world began promoting themselves to meeting and convention organizers based on their intellectual capital, versus venues and attractions. Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau (GCB), led this strategy in Europe at the time. Around the same year, I was visiting the House of Logistics & Mobility (HOLM) think tank in Frankfurt. The GCB suggested I visit there to better understand this new direction for attracting high-value business events in advanced industries. "The city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," Dr. Stefan Walter told me, who was a professor at HOLM at the time. "So, this [GCB] strategy is about finding the strengths of our strengths, our core competencies, and for Germany, that’s knowledge and infrastructure. It’s also about connecting ideas.” That has been my due north working in the travel industry ever since. This idea that meeting planners and attendees can tap into a deep knowledge base in a host destination, specific to their interests, for me, is intoxicating. The challenge is it takes a ton of work connecting local leaders in specific advanced industries, like aviation in Frankfurt or e-mobility in Stuttgart, with large global organizations in those same industries and convince them to bring their big annual event to Germany. It's also pretty high level. From an attendee standpoint, if I'm in Hamburg and want to learn about HafenCity, the largest urban makeover in Europe, it's not like I can easily access a bunch of people and organizations leading the future of urban development. Which, would be cool, right? AI is helping make that a reality. Germany's national Open Data/Knowledge Graph project is an ambitious AI-powered initiative to build a massive network of industry suppliers, academic organizations and business leaders across the country. Basically, by indexing the visitor industry and intellectual capital supply chain, Germany can connect the brightest minds in Germany with the rest of the world more seamlessly, effectively and equitably. An "interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," if you will. I spoke with Mr. Schultze to learn more about how AI is impacting the meetings and convention industry in Germany. Greg Oates: How is AI evolving across Germany's visitor industry? Specifically, how are your municipal CVBs and other partners thinking about and using AI right now? Matthias Schultze: Like much of the world, things really accelerated for us around two years ago with the rise of tools like ChatGPT. Suddenly, everyone, from corporates to associations, started thinking seriously about AI. We saw an opportunity and created an innovation platform called ebx.lab . It’s a peer-to-peer learning community for event planners, where we partner with scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute to explore how AI might reshape the business events space. From those early sessions, we have published a few white papers and identified a few core insights. AI clearly has potential to personalize experiences, optimize event planning processes, improve engagement and networking, and maybe most exciting, support predictive analytics. That last one, especially, being able to anticipate trends or behaviors based on data, is what feels most transformative to me personally. GO: How is the GCB embracing AI internally? MS: We developed our own internal AI strategy for the German Convention Bureau. We wanted to give both our team and our stakeholders a shared framework, something that outlined where we are today, where we want to go, and how we get there. It’s called "Driven by People, Powered by Data," and that title really reflects our belief that AI is a tool, not a solution in itself. People need to lead the process. The strategy helps us clarify not just what we can do with AI, but also what we can’t or shouldn’t do, at least not yet. It outlines our roadmap and aligns everyone across our organization and membership. GO: Is that strategy available publicly? MS: Yes, though only in German for now. But with the right AI tools, you can translate it quickly. The strategy touches on everything from marketing and communications to event planning, workflow automation, customer personalization, sustainability, and even ethics and compliance. The ethics component is particularly important. As exciting as AI is, we have to keep guardrails in place. Within our organization, we’re working hard to ensure that AI isn’t something siloed or limited to leadership. It needs to be embedded across every level. Everyone in the organization is expected to develop basic AI literacy. We’ve also worked on minimum viable products for things like dashboards and customer-facing chatbots. Some are already in use today. GO: You've always been a strong and vocal proponent for sustainability in business events. How is AI supporting you there? MS: I’m very proud of a project we developed with 29 other European countries: the Sustainability Hub for Events . It’s an AI-driven platform that brings together all kinds of sustainability related data—certifications, guidelines, best practices—and makes them accessible through an interactive AI agent. Planners can ask things like, “Can you help me build a sustainable menu?” or input event details to estimate their CO₂ footprint. It’s highly practical, and it’s making a real difference for event planners who need fast, reliable and actionable sustainability information. GO: We've talked about your Open Data and Knowledge Graph project in Germany numerous times in the past. Is that now live? MS: It’s technically live but still in progress, and probably always will be, in a sense. We’re continuously expanding it. The Open Data Germany project by the German National Tourist Board is live with its Knowledge Graph. The Open Data MICE project, which is implemented in close cooperation with the GNTB, is not yet live. One exciting element launching soon is an interactive map of research institutions in Germany. It will show where key research and innovation is taking place, including medical tech, renewable energy and so on, and link that data to infrastructure like hotels and conference venues. The idea is to visualize Germany as a knowledge landscape. If you’re planning an event and you want to anchor it around a theme like urban mobility, the map will show you which regions are most active in that field and match you with the relevant venues and experts. GO: One theme I keep obsessing about, and it's felt like a bit of a fantasy for more than a decade, is that the city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine. That idea is a direct quote from your House of Logistics and Mobility in Frankfurt, and it’s stuck with me ever since I heard it back in 2011. It's this idea of a city as a platform. Do you think we're getting closer to executing on this idea, where innovation at all levels is more accessible and shareable for more people? Ultimately what we're talking about here is the democratization of knowledge and excellence. MS: I love that idea. I really do. I think there are two layers to it. On one level, we have the smart city movement with systems that integrate transportation, energy, data and infrastructure to make better decisions. That’s already happening in many places across Europe. But on a deeper level, regarding your fantasy.... Let's say you could land in Munich, be interested in urban tech, and immediately connect with people, events and institutions aligned with that interest—that’s becoming possible too. The data already exists. It’s just scattered. But with open data standards, machine readability, and the right AI tools, we can start connecting those dots. Your fantasy city may not be so far off.

A CEO's Playbook for AI Integration Oct 10 Written By Greg Oates Your competitors are talking about AI. Your board is asking about AI. Your partners want to see your AI strategy. Many DMOs are debating the potential of AI, while an increasing number of others are already extracting real business and organizational value. The difference isn't budget or technical talent. It's knowing exactly where to look for opportunities and how to scale what works. 3 Non-Negotiables You Must Lead This, Not Delegate It: AI transformation dies in committee. The organizations seeing real results have CEOs who champion specific initiatives, remove bureaucratic friction, and signal that AI adoption is a strategic priority. This doesn't mean micromanaging prompts. It means creating air cover for teams to experiment and fail fast. Complex Impresses, Simple Delivers: Your instinct will be to pursue the flashy, sophisticated AI applications that sound impressive in board presentations. Resist it. The organizations generating real ROI start with mundane problems: expense report processing, meeting summarization, competitive monitoring, etc. These boring use cases build organizational confidence and create the foundation for more ambitious projects. Your People Know Where the Problems Are: The best AI applications emerge from the intersection of daily frustration and technological possibility. Run hackathons. Create cross-functional workshops. Ask your teams what they do that feels like waste. The solutions they surface will be more practical and impactful than anything your consultants recommend. Start Here Stop looking for AI opportunities everywhere. Focus your organization's attention on three specific areas where AI creates immediate, measurable value. The Tedium Tax: Every role in your organization includes mind-numbing tasks that consume time without creating value: data entry, compliance documentation, procurement reports, staff vacation tracking, etc. Think of these as your "Anti To-Do List." These are tasks systematically eliminated by asking, "How can I never have to do this again?" Your teams are paying a tedium tax every day. AI is the refund. The Expertise Bottleneck: Projects stall when teams hit the limits of their skills and wait for other departments. Marketing needs data analysis and campaign design mockups. Finance and HR need custom GPTs. Sales needs meetings-related technical specifications translated into customer language. AI breaks these bottlenecks by giving every team superpowers they never had before. The Blank Page Problem: Knowledge work involves ambiguous challenges where the path forward isn't clear: Strategy development, market analysis, problem diagnosis, etc. AI excels at generating multiple approaches, analyzing incomplete information, and proposing next steps when your teams are stuck. It's the thinking partner that's always available and never runs out of ideas. 6 Use Cases OpenAI's analysis of 600+ successful implementations across various industries reveals that virtually every valuable AI application falls into one of six categories. Show your teams these six use cases and they'll start finding opportunities everywhere. Content Creation: Use AI for first drafts of everything: strategy documents, marketing campaigns, product and experience descriptions, customer and community communications. AI maintains your brand voice while eliminating the blank page problem. Research and Synthesis: AI powers information gathering at superhuman speed, including market analysis, competitive intelligence, customer feedback synthesis, regulatory research, etc.. AI doesn't just find information. It structures it exactly how you need it for decision-making. Coding for Everyone: Your non-technical teams can now write Python scripts, SQL queries, and data visualizations. Your engineering teams debug faster and prototype in unfamiliar languages. AI democratizes technical capability while accelerating your experts. Data Analysis Without Degrees: Upload spreadsheets, dashboard screenshots or raw data files and get structured analysis without requiring PhD-level statistics knowledge. This is arguably the most undervalued opportunity that delivers immediate results for most DMOs. Strategic Thinking Partner: AI is a beast for brainstorming, scenario planning, product and event development, asset mapping, risk analysis, etc. AI helps structure complex problems and identifies considerations your teams might miss. This is my favorite use case for AI. Intelligent Automation: Use platforms like n8n, Relay and others to create repeatable processes that run themselves, such as weekly competitive updates, financial reporting, sales and marketing workflows, a ton of admin duties, etc. Create the process once, then let AI handle the execution while humans focus on exceptions and strategy. Implementation is Where DMOs Fail Most AI initiatives fail because organizations treat them like traditional software deployments. They're not. AI is about change management and behavioral transformation up and down the org chart. AI implementation requires different approaches to discovery, prioritization and scaling. Systematic Opportunity Hunting: Don't wait for AI use cases to emerge organically. Run structured discovery sessions where teams audit their workflows for repetitive tasks, skill bottlenecks, and ambiguous challenges. Make this process ongoing, not a one-time exercise. The Impact-Effort Matrix: Not every AI opportunity deserves attention. Prioritize based on business impact versus implementation effort. Quick wins build momentum. High-value, high-effort projects become strategic investments. Everything else gets parked until technology makes it easier. Innovation as Culture: Internal competitions accelerate discovery while building AI literacy across your organization. The goal isn't technical sophistication. It's practical business solutions that teams actually want to use. Measure What Matters: Track time saved, accuracy improved, costs reduced and capability expansion. But also measure qualitative impacts: employee satisfaction, process improvements, competitive advantages. Use this data to guide scaling decisions. Build Your AI Process Move beyond random experimentation to systematic capability building. I like Estée Lauder's 5-phase process to ensure repeatable success with AI. Does this resonate with you for your DMO? Design: Define your purpose, scope and success criteria for AI integration in a 2-page brief. No scope creep. No technical complexity for its own sake. Prepare: Ask department heads to gather relevant data and best practices. AI tools should reflect organizational knowledge, not generic approaches. Build and Test: Hire contractors where necessary to help teams develop automations/agents, implement training, integrate datasets and validate accuracy. Focus on usability, not just functionality. Launch: Deploy with user guides and change management support. Technology deployment is easy. User adoption across all departments is a total headache at first. Optimize: Feedback loops drive continuous improvement based on actual usage patterns. AI applications evolve with business needs and improved capabilities. Key Insight: Always start with fundamental questions: Why build this? What problem does it solve? What impact will it have? Is the measurement for success quantitative or qualitative? Organizations that answer these questions clearly will build more successful AI applications than those focused primarily on technical capability. Build AI-Native Workflows The most sophisticated implementations integrate AI across entire business processes rather than individual tasks. This evolution positions organizations for the agentic AI capabilities coming next. Process Decomposition: Break complex workflows into constituent tasks, identify where each AI use case category adds value, and create integrated approaches spanning from research through execution. Marketing workflows might integrate research for market understanding, analysis for opportunity mapping, ideation for strategy, content creation for product and destination development, and automation for distribution. Cross-Functional Integration: AI facilitates better collaboration by translating between departments. Technical specifications become marketing language. Customer requirements inform sales priorities. Financial models drive strategic planning. Future-Proofing for Agents: Current workflow integration prepares your organization for AI agents that can complete entire projects independently. Teams that understand how to break processes into AI-addressable components will leverage these capabilities immediately when available. The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done. This cognitive shift creates advantages that compound over time and become increasingly difficult for competitors to replicate. "The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done." Key Takeaways The question isn't whether AI will transform our industry. It's whether you'll be leading that transformation or reacting to it. Start with clear, achievable use cases and systemic approaches to build the organizational muscle needed for transformation. AI advantage isn't about having the most technical teams or biggest budgets. It's about developing capabilities for organization-wide discovery, adoption, implementation and scaling of practical business solutions. The organizations moving beyond experimentation to systematic implementation today will be best positioned to leverage the more sophisticated AI capabilities emerging tomorrow. The agents are coming. Will you be ready? Greg Oates

The ROI of AI Agents Aug 21 Written By Greg Oates Based on a bunch of conversations at DI Annual 2025 this month, it's clear that many DMO executives still equate generative AI primarily with writing and editing in ChatGPT. But as one COO of a large U.S. DMO told me, "Surely there's more to all this than just learning about prompting." So many ways to respond to that. Meanwhile, there are also DMO leaders who established AI road maps for their organizations going back two years. For them, they're increasingly focused on developing AI-powered automated workflows and their more sophisticated cousins, AI agents. The purpose of these synthetic workflows is to automate tedious, time-consuming and repetitive tasks to free up staff to focus on more high-value work. Think of it as an evolution from using AI to building AI. You begin by visually mapping what people do in your organization. Then you identify where AI can potentially take over all the mundane stuff better and faster. I’ve been working with my colleagues at Matador Network to develop automated workflows for our Studio team. We have endless terabytes of client video created during the last 10 years. Now, with AI, we want to capitalize on those existing assets to create new video, but first we need to use AI to understand what we actually own. We contracted Erick Bonilla , founder of Pocho.tech based in Uruguay, to build a series of new AI workflows in n8n. One of the automations is designed to cull through 10 years of video files in Dropbox and catalogue everything in Airtable. The AI then creates standardized file names, project IDs, links for raw edited videos and finished client hero/cutdown videos, and location and content tags. The cost to develop the AI workflow was about $2,000 all-in, and it saved more than a month of work at a mid-level manager salary. The beauty of automations/agents is you can measure ROI annually fairly easily, which will help wake up your board if they're sleeping on AI. Moreover, once an automation is in place, the savings will continue to accrue in the future indefinitely for tasks still required, and there’s zero human error. During a staff Zoom, I asked members of our Studio team if they felt these new agents signaled to them the beginning of the end of some people’s jobs. The response was unanimous. Nobody wants to do this type of repetitive grunt work. I spoke with Bonilla for his take on the future of AI agents. Greg Oates: Erick, what services does Pocho.tech provide? Erick Bonilla: We identify opportunities within organizations of all sizes, where we believe implementing AI systems can dramatically improve the efficiency of operations. We can create workflows that process data, or we can create AI agents capable of reasoning, analyzing data, creating reports, and providing decision-makers with an enhanced way of digesting information. I have been doing this for almost two years, working with people mostly in the Middle East, the US and Latin America. The Pocha company site is brand new as I try to expand in the world of AI. GO: What’s the difference between automated workflows and agents? EB: A workflow is like a mass production factory. It's a set of operations that work through specific logic to automate a repetitive process that a human has done before. This could be writing and reading emails, writing summaries, reformatting and transferring content through different tools and applications, etc. An AI agent is a thinking environment that makes decisions for you. You can set a workflow for reading your emails. But then you can have an AI agent that summarizes your emails and tells you, if you have 10 emails, what those 10 emails are about in just one email, SMS text, WhatsApp message, Google doc or whatever. GO: So an AI agent has more autonomy and decision-making capabilities than an automated workflow? EB: Definitely. The AI agent is capable of being completely autonomous to make decisions within a given context. You give it a context with defined restrictions that narrows the scope of the decisions it can make. GO: Can you provide any success stories where you worked with a client who had a specific challenge, and you created an automated workflow or agent that successfully delivered a solution? EB: The most recent example is an EdTech company in Boston that provides a training and placement program for clean energy jobs. They've been operating for the past five years, but there’s been a lack of funds, employees and program applicants to scale beyond Massachusetts. So they decided to use AI and automation to build flows without having to invest a lot of money in hiring people. What I did was streamline the application process for people interested in entering the educational program. We created a form and a workflow that takes the information from the application and puts it into an application tracking system. This system has workflows that can trigger emails, daily reports, weekly reports and invitations to interview. Then I created an AI agent. Once the applicants are interviewed by a human, we take the transcript of that, analyze it using AI, and build a report for the decision maker so they can decide if this person is capable of entering the program or not. We also created a scoring system. We built it based on human criteria, which is subjective, and then we converted that into an objective dataset so we could classify people and score them based on numbers. All of this is done by an AI agent that sets a score for the applicant at the end of the interview. Then we have a leaderboard where people are ranked, and the top 15 get into the education program and placement process. GO: Were they happy with the end result? EB: Oh yeah, very happy. Here's where the beauty and magic come in. Now the CEO can envision a way of expanding outside Massachusetts, and tell her team, "Hey, we're going to New York!" Where before, she thought she needed to hire more people in each new state to oversee the operation. And, because an AI agent works 24/7, she doesn't have to wait until 8am to get a report or transcription, or anything anymore. So now, she can think about how to scale her company more successfully without having to hire more people. GO: What's the road map looking ahead? Where are you going with the company in terms of next steps? EB: We're trying to create an outreach system because the purpose of the company is not only to train people but also to place them in clean tech job positions. The outreach system is going to help the team find more companies with open positions, so the company can place more people in those positions. We’re building a system involving AI agents and workflows where we're going to take a picture of all the open positions and analyze and understand them using AI. We want to know, what are the requirements in terms of learning and knowledge capacity for people to get in these positions, so the company can build a better training program. GO: What was the biggest challenge working with them? EB: I think the most important one, and this is something anyone working on this will experience, is the resistance of some team members who don't trust the performance of AI enough. People who have low experience working with AI, and maybe only know ChatGPT, will look at this and say, "I don't believe this can work." So that means there’s a lot of educational work. People need enough knowledge about what AI tools are capable of to suggest what can and can’t work. I think that's the main challenge. But once people see it working, they start to lean into AI. Suddenly, they become like, "This is great. Can you add this other metric? Can you make it do this other thing too? Can you make me one for my personal side hustle?" It's interesting when you see people moving from resistance to acceptance. GO: Working with you has firmly cemented something I've been preoccupied with this year. It's this: One of the most exciting things about AI, which is giving us more time back during the day, requires the most boring thing, which is having uniform file and data structure. As we've discovered together only too well, AI can't reach its full potential unless you have everything structured super cleanly. The analogy I often use is that AI is like an 8-year-old savant. The person is brilliant but he or she often needs really consistent environments and clear guardrails, or things go sideways or just crash. Can you talk about what any organization needs to focus on when it comes to file and data structure? EB: I think one of the most basic things, and I'm living this with a company I'm helping right now, is documenting files and folders exactly the same. You must set protocols for everything when you’re building a folder system to store content and data. That's one of the biggest challenges for companies trying to implement AI automation with poorly standardized systems. When we didn’t have AI a few years ago, we didn't think of a machine reading our documents or files. We never thought that could be possible, so we never really focused on creating really good file structure. The biggest challenge for companies, coming back to Matador, is how to organize the field of play so that AI doesn't struggle. We easily lose the excitement of implementing AI in an organization when an AI is trying to navigate a maze of poorly organized files. For that, you need to build SOPs that tell everyone on the team, “We're going to be naming files this way now so that a 5-year-old can read the titles and understand what's in every one of them. Because if a 5-year-old can read this set of folders and understand what's inside all of them, then AI can do that too. And if AI can find and read everything, then AI can do some truly amazing things and save companies a lot of money. GO: So how are organizations like ours, which have been in operation for a long time, supposed to go back decades and reorganize all our files? EB: We can run a workflow that can do that for you. That's where the ROI comes in. You can make a one-time investment building a workflow that's going to completely standardize all your filing and foldering. But if you do that, you have to know that the ROI might not show up right away. It's going to start paying off later in terms of the time, money, stress and everything it’s going to give back. A CEO must understand that the return on that investment is going to be ongoing through the years, not in the next quarter necessarily. If you have that mentality, then your company is going to become AI-first. GO: You’ve told me before that AI is not a tool, it's a culture. Can you explain that? EB: Right now, the biggest obstacle for AI expanding in many companies are the CEOs. I understand the challenges because they fear a lot of reputational risk. You have a board and customers that are going to be judging you. If you don't have a very good AI road map, then it could turn into a failure, and the fingers are going to be pointing at you. I understand that completely. But AI should be a culture within companies, and that starts top down because the CEO has to embrace trial and error. AI is going to fail at least during the first time you start with any automation. It's like when you're building a prompt. We were talking the other day, and you said using AI is not about writing the perfect first prompt. It's that fifth or sixth prompt that's going to get you to the right answer. You're going to be iterating with automation, too. That's something CEOs have to transmit throughout the organization. GO: I think for many tourism organizations, we haven’t even begun talking about the big picture value of AI. From an internal perspective, for example, agents offer a whole new level for optimizing operations with AI. EB: Yes, exactly. When we're in a company and we're facing challenges, the first intuitive thinking is, "How can I solve this? I'm going to Google it.” Now we're transitioning to, "How can I solve this? I'm going to ask ChatGPT.” This is great, but that's not AI-first. That's changing one tool for another. You're still browsing. It's literally the same thing. You're not really using AI. AI-first means, "I do this thing that's consuming 10 hours a week. I do the same thing every time. I spend two hours every day doing the same four steps. How can I use AI to automate this?" That's AI-first because you're using AI to stop wasting time. I think that's the culture we should be striving for. If a CEO injects the whole company with that mindset, then the employees are going to eventually use AI to solve their issues more independently and autonomously. At the end of the day, what AI really does is gives us more time and more of our lives back, and we have not yet understood that because it's new. But it's true, AI is the way for humans to have more life. GO: I want that. EB: We all do. GO: I have this belief that eventually, in any organization, all meetings will be recorded and deposited into a central knowledge base where an AI can summarize everything and connect all the key takeaways. I might have a meeting and someone on the other side of the world has a meeting, and the AI will know we're talking about the same thing. It will see and surface how there's potential opportunity to connect our efforts. It's like one plus one equals three, or more. Do you think that's where we're going and that it will benefit companies? EB: Definitely. It's the most common sense thing to do, but I know it's also counterintuitive because there are many people who would not like to have all conversations recorded. The fidelity, the accuracy of the information, and it all being in one place and uniformly structured, is everything. You can have thousands of conversations and tell the AI, "Go here and search for this specific idea in all the transcripts where we have talked about that." You just need to build the SOPs. Then a human can quality control it and say, "This is right. This isn't right. Maybe we can tweak this, or build on that." GO: I’ve experienced this firsthand where people are vehemently against this idea of all company meetings being recorded. For many it portends that clichéd dystopic future we see in science fiction, where everything's controlled and you have no freedom, right? EB: I can see it too. We must remember that these tools can be turned off. If we let the technology control us, then that's on us. I think at the end of the day, it's about how do you balance the risk and rewards? This is something CEOs are used to. Do you prefer to live in blindness and have an uncompetitive company because you decided not to take that risk with automation? Or do you take the risk and have everything recorded, even though some people are going to say it’s Orwellian in a way, and even though ultimately it's going to improve everybody's life? We have to find that balance, and that’s the CEO’s role to determine what’s best overall for the company, customers and employees in the future. GO: Any last thoughts? EB: I think we are not quite there yet to know for sure the amount of ROI that is going to come from agents and automations. Definitely it is going to be positive ROI. For that, I'm completely sure. What I'm not sure is how do we measure ROI based on the anticipated lifetime value of the process? So much is changing so quickly and it's difficult to see the future. As the tools get better, then the workflow gets better too, so the ROI increases, right? Except, we don't really have models for that. For CEOs, I think, they have to try to envision how they can measure the value of automations now, and how that might evolve exponentially in the future. Greg Oates

What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates CEOs at destination marketing and management organizations (DMOs) are seeking AI guidance specifically tailored to their chief executive roles. A CEO in the U.S. told me recently that current AI education is often too surface level, vague, unstructured, or trying to cover too much ground to be useful for a chief executive. He said, "We've been talking for a while now about how we need AI education targeting leadership, but it doesn't really exist." While destination leaders face many more questions about AI than answers, one thing is 100% clear: CEOs must own and lead their organizations' AI integration across all departments. AI isn't something to outsource or delegate to others, and it's not a "marketing thing" for the CMO to figure out. Conor Grennan , chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, consults with clients on AI strategy from JPMorgan to NASA. I asked him how important it is for CEOs to lead AI education, adoption and integration across their organizations. “CEOs have to understand how to use AI and why; they really have to have felt the delight about what AI can do,” he said. "They also have to see clearly how AI is a leadership and change management challenge, not a tech challenge. Then they need to start out being vulnerable, and be able to say, ‘Hey, I was skeptical about AI. I didn’t understand it, either. But now I can explain the way I learned it and how to communicate why it’s important to help other people understand it.” So why do CEOs need to understand AI? Jeff Bezos answered that at The New York Times DealBook Summit last year. He described how “modern AI is a horizontal enabling layer" that will soon be integrated into every device and digital application in existence. "These kind of horizontal layers like electricity and compute and now artificial intelligence, they go everywhere," he said. "I guarantee you there is not a single application that you can think of that is not going to be made better by AI." Here's the clip: Strategic AI Approaches I met with about a dozen CEOs in North America to find out what they want to know about AI specifically from a CEO perspective. Some leaders are seeking big-picture guidance with a broad overview of high-level strategy. "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” one CEO told me. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" Another chief executive said, “We see three areas of opportunity for AI: Administrative tasks and general productivity; marketing chat, SEO and data readiness; and helping customers find information about our city more effectively.… The two most important things I want to know are how to develop AI policy and how is AI changing SEO." A year ago, most CEOs had a wait-and-see attitude about AI, following how the technology evolved and what their cohorts in other organizations were doing. Today, there is a general consensus among CEOs that they need to invest in AI, but the question is how and where. One CEO told me he knows he needs to integrate AI tools and processes into his DMO, but he has three overarching questions that he wants answered first, at least at a high level: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” Other CEOs are seeking clarity on the basic fundamentals of AI: "I need to understand what are the problems that we're trying to solve with AI. What is the purpose of a chatbot, for example? What am I buying, and what can we as an organization accomplish with it?" And then others just want immediate actionable solutions: "I'm not interested in hypotheticals. Show me five ways I can implement AI on Monday. Give me turnkey AI solutions that work today." AI Data is King Personalized data is one of generative AI’s biggest value propositions. Conversational AI (chat) is the new marketplace, and it’s eating the entire funnel including in-destination engagement. In some cities, AI chat conversations between DMOs and visitors is exceeding 25% in-destination, giving DMOs a way to influence visitor behavior in real time. Also, in some industry segments like tours and activities, in-chat conversations are driving in-destination bookings with partners like GetYourGuide. Everyone is looking for first/zero-party data around that. “We have a low level of proprietary data about who is in our destination and what they’re doing,” asserted one CEO. “We have a few disparate data sources, but we need to connect those, and we want to be able to use it predictively. For example, we're looking at regression analysis to help develop future scenario modeling, and we're looking at AI to help us with that." Another CEO said, “We need data that provides material value for our partners. That’s our mandate. How are our visitors spending money and where? How are they behaving and traveling through our area? How can we help people find our partners in a more personalized way?” And one CEO added, "A key priority for us is figuring out the data equation so outbound messaging can be tailored to a 1-on-1 relationship.” Striving for that direct individual customer engagement has been the holy grail for marketers for decades. The ability to deliver mass personalization at scale is now coming into focus with enhanced AI data curation. National organizations like Destination Canada and Germany Travel have invested millions of dollars in data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to restructure their tourism product data from scratch, capitalize on the data more effectively to rank higher in AI search, and drive incremental revenue to partners. That's what the future looks like. For more information, check out the new Canadian Tourism Data Collective and Germany's Open Data Project . Today, local tourism organizations are starting to see how data structure and content architecture are strategic imperatives for them, too. One municipal CEO explained, "I think it might almost be too early to have this conversation in some areas until AI matures more. One thing I am eager to know now is how do we develop a data lake to structure our own data and messaging to make it easier for AI search tools to find." AI search and SEO are a huge conversation today. During the past year, the #1 question I heard while speaking about AI with dozens of North American destination organizations, their boards and key industry/community stakeholders, was: How do we rank higher in AI search? What happens when AI buries organic content? What’s going to happen to our websites? Are they going to disappear? Is a DMO without a website still a DMO? How do we need to produce content differently? And, what the heck is a data lake? One CEO I spoke with is planning on developing a new website for her organization. She said, "I don't even know what I don't know about AI search, but we need to figure some of that out before we start spending any money." Along with data, defining KPIs for AI integration is a hot topic of debate, and presently there isn’t a complete and codified list of metrics that DMO leaders agree on. That said, perhaps the travel and tourism industry collectively needs to understand what AI is, and what it can accomplish at scale, before attaching too many metrics to it. A CMO told me at DI MarCom Summit this month, “People didn’t ask about ROI with the internet when it first came around. We just knew we had to have it,” because it was a new channel for reaching visitors. Same as AI now. Expanding on that, he suggested that DMOs need to break AI success tracking into awareness metrics and performance metrics, and get that conversation right before anything else. Staff AI Adoption Unlike previous technology evolutions, there doesn’t seem to be as much of a generational divide between early adopters of AI and everyone else. The industry can’t look to Gen Z for guidance about how to use AI to the same degree we once asked Millennials for insights about Instagram. Again, driving AI adoption across an organization begins with the CEO. Once that’s established, the real challenge is convincing department leaders and staff to lean into AI. It's a challenge because there is widespread concern, skepticism and/or suspicion among many staff members across many industries that they’re being asked to learn new technologies that will eventually replace them. Leadership should say to employees that no one can force them to use AI, but the job market will. The data is clear. According to the Linkedin/Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index : 79% of leaders agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with Al skills than a more experienced one without 66% of leaders won’t hire someone without AI skills 60% of leaders worry their organization lacks a plan and vision to implement AI And that's a year old. But, understandably, emphasizing those numbers comes across as threatening. A better strategy for driving AI adoption is finding staff members who are already seeing success with AI, supporting them with access to education and pro AI models, and working out from there. The more employees see their colleagues using AI, the more some of them feel inclined to lean in. Therefore, every DMO needs a comprehensive strategic AI road map that includes purpose, policy, education, integration and a continuous feedback loop across all levels of staff. CEOs need to create a space for that. "We're giving our staff time to play around with AI, but they have to present what they're focusing on and what they're learning to their individual supervisor," a CEO told me. Another added, “We're focusing on staff adoption. But I need you to explain to me what works, how to implement, and what should I watch out for." I'm presently working with our departments at Matador Network to explore a bunch of various AI models to optimize workflows, boost creativity, enhance strategic planning, diversify product, etc. There's a well-communicated mandate from the top that Matador will become an AI-first company, and sooner than later. To help accelerate that, we created an AI task force to bring more perspectives from across the company together to integrate AI into operations. That has been valuable with some immediate takeaways, such as staff is now reaching out and asking for assistance with AI. But it's only a start. "There's this idea that if you can get a core group of people using AI then their attitudes and behaviors will spread organically throughout the rest of the company," said Conor Grennan at NYU. "It doesn't work that way. You have to find the people who have fears about AI and listen to them to understand why. You have to say, 'Yes, AI does suck at that, but here's what it's good at.' You also need to weed out the negative people who are against AI outright. They're dangerous." 5 Key Takeaways Let's go back to that first CEO who wants to know the five big questions about AI. Based on the input from the above CEOs, here's a first stab at that: How can I create AI policy that serves our organization but doesn't suppress experimentation among staff? (Interestingly, policy did not come up that much with the CEOs I spoke with.) How do we need to develop our websites, content and data to rank higher in AI search? How is AI SEO different, and the same, as old SEO? What are existing AI chat platforms accomplishing, how are visitors using them, and how are they influencing travel decision making and purchase behavior? If AI is not just for marketing, what does the ecosystem of AI tools for all departments look like across the organization? And what do they do in terms of increasing productivity, creativity and quality? How do I get staff to buy in? We know AI is an imperative for our organization's competitive advantage and relevance. And we know AI is an imperative for employees for their professional growth and marketability. But how do we get our people to really believe in the need to embrace AI? Greg Oates

Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Royce Chwin, president and CEO of Destination Vancouver , personifies how a DMO chief executive needs to establish and articulate the mandate for integrating AI across the organization. That was the topic of our last Destination AI post where 12 CEOs explained: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . Early in 2024, Chwin addressed the full staff in Destination Vancouver’s office before a session I was presenting there on AI. “We cannot not do this,” he said, stating that the organization needed to adopt AI processes to stay relevant in the industry and increase its value in the community. If Destination Vancouver is positioning itself as an innovative DMO, he explained, then the road ahead with AI was clear. Since then, Destination Vancouver launched a new website fully integrated with AI where visitors can customize how they find travel information. The build was a two-year process requiring an inordinate amount of learning to capitalize on generative AI. The team also developed an AI policy guide that Chwin shared for this post. The comprehensive document is designed to "provide clear protocols that maximize and encourage the use of Al tools where appropriate and safe to do so, while minimizing any potential risks and concerns." The policy guide encourages staff to use AI for "enhancing productivity, efficiency, creativity or decision-making." It defines when not to use AI models and how staff is required to review and validate all AI outputs for accuracy and bias. Also, Stefan Hawes, vp of global marketing, initiated the development of an internal AI Council, bringing together a diverse group of staff to coordinate AI processes across the organization. Chwin shared an internal briefing report outlining the purpose of the Council as follows: It is recommended that an AI Council be established immediately to provide a centralized body for managing AI-related initiatives and to expand training opportunities for team members. The Council will focus on: Setting strategic priorities related to AI Selecting use cases, implementing projects/initiatives/AI software purchases and evaluating their effectiveness Developing a data strategy to support AI adoption and initiatives Developing an AI education, literacy and adoption program Ensuring ethical compliance Fostering cross-departmental collaboration to maximize the impact of AI projects We created a similar AI task force at Matador, and the value of that cannot be overstated to better assess how staff from different departments perceive, and misperceive, AI in general. I talked with Chwin this week to better understand how a DMO CEO can best lead strategic AI implementation across his or her organization. The purpose of this post is to help inform, inspire and influence other CEOs to consider the opportunities of AI in a new light. Greg Oates: Royce, you've been a strident proponent of AI for a couple years now, and yet there are many other CEOs who are still reticent. How did you personally come to decide Destination Vancouver needed to embrace AI? Royce Chwin: The perception still of some DMOs is that we are behind when it comes to technology. We're slow to adapt. We're slow to evolve. You see all these other organizations in the travel sphere around us that are able to move much quicker. They might be capitalized better. They can adjust. They can pivot quicker to take on these new technologies, and they can experiment seemingly without the degree of fear or consternation that maybe some DMOs have. So, I think there's lots of different reasons. For us, I mean, it's day and night. We can't not do that. Our entire ecosystem that we play in has some level of AI being used. Number one is our customers. They’re using AI. So it goes back to that same idea that you and I have discussed many times before: How do we as a DMO stay relevant and how do we show value? AI is a response to answering those two things. GO: In many organizations today, there’s often skepticism and suspicion among staff about how AI might take their jobs, or they’re dismissive of AI altogether. How does your team feel about AI overall? RC: I'm not finding a fear in our organization for using AI. I think it's a different set of challenges. I think there are so many derivatives of AI out there that people don't know what to focus on. Because you can’t and don't need to focus on 40 different AI tools. The question is, what are the best tools that are most relevant to the work that I need to do? That, I think, in my experience is a bigger challenge. My sense of it is that AI can be so overwhelming. It can seem unbelievably complicated. So we had to ask ourselves, do we have the time, resources and skill sets to simply understand it? Secondly, are we asking better questions to understand what in the organization we need to solve, and can AI help? GO: In a previous post, I shared input from 12 DMO CEOs about how they feel about AI. What are you hearing from other CEOs? RC: I was over in Europe recently for Destinations International’s Global Leaders Forum where I was onstage with Sherrif Karamat (CEO of PCMA) and Petra Stušek (CEO at Ljubljana Tourism). We were talking about the importance of face-to-face meetings and so on, and Sherrif made a comment that DMOs are really behind using AI. It was kind of a blanket statement, and he's not wrong. But, I said to Sheriff that I think a lot of DMOs are behind because it's like throwing confetti in somebody's face and asking them to pick the best pieces. They don't even know what they're trying to evaluate, and it’s also moving so fast. In the meantime, our customers are running around us using AI for all kinds of things. And so I think that there's not so much a fear of using AI. It’s more that people are questioning how to respond to the increasing emergence of AI because they’re thinking, “I'm not really 100% clear on the business problem I'm trying to solve that supports my mandate.” For us, and you saw it when you visited, we were really clear on what it is that we needed to do. We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI. “We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI.” GO: I’ve been asserting that CEOs should own and lead AI adoption in their organizations to have the best chance for success. I don't mean lead it day to day. I mean the chief executive must establish the mandate that AI is something the organization is going to invest in, and articulate why and how to the entire staff. Connor Grennan, chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, emphasized to me that’s the only way this works. Do you agree? RC: Yes, I absolutely believe it must come from the CEO because the CEO has to clear the vision with the team. And with something as seismic as AI, and how it’s evolving in our daily life, in our world, I think the CEO has a responsibility to address it and how it will impact the organization. Everyone needs to understand how we’re going to use AI in alignment with our mission and strategic goals, and how it will support the mandate. That's all CEO level. That's the responsibility on my head. Also, I can't imagine going in front of my Board and asking, “Hey, what are you doing with AI? What should we do with AI?” So it has to come from the CEO, but my Board has also enabled me. Like, there's no grief from my Board. Zero. We are fully enabled. GO: You've created the necessary structure to help govern AI integration with your AI Policy and AI Council. Can you expand on the thinking behind those? RC: We developed an AI policy that’s designed to enable people to use AI and not discourage them from experimenting. Obviously, some education is required in terms of proprietary information and those kinds of things. But we're really leaning into this and we're going to assign some time for it to enable the organization to experiment and play with AI without fear of reprisal. Naturally there needs to be governance around it, but governance does not mean stopping creativity. Governance means we’re creating and delivering new opportunities for creativity. There just needs to be structure around that. Also, Stefan came up with the idea of pulling together an AI Council in the organization, which I think is fantastic. We're getting individuals from each business line, including myself, and we’re going to talk about AI, its impacts, what we need to be thinking about, and how we'll improve our website and the organization as a whole. So we're creating dialogue around it to define opportunities. For example, I'm really excited about AI as it relates to all the country market analysis that we do. We've been doing that by spreadsheet, but now we’re exploring AI to provide the insights we need to inform our market planning more effectively. There are lots of different examples like that, but you only discover them by being open to experimenting with AI. Greg Oates

Toronto & Denver Tourism Leaders on the 5 Big AI Questions for CEOs Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates A year from now, the travel and tourism sector might look back and thank Andrew Weir, president and CEO of Destination Toronto , for catalyzing how DMOs move forward with AI. At PCMA Convening Leaders in January this year, I asked Weir what CEOs need to understand about AI at a high level. Numerous other CEOs have told me there’s a complete lack of AI education specifically designed for DMO chief executives. His answer was first shared anonymously in our previous post, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” said Weir. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" At the end of that post I suggested what those five questions might be based on all the CEO insights in there, and I've since been shopping them around to vet them. A few weeks ago, for example, Richard Scharf, president and CEO at Visit Denver , suggested restructuring the questions to create a more logical hierarchy. Now, the first three deal with internal operations while the last two identify external, visitor-facing priorities. Yesterday, I spoke again with Weir, as well as Paula Port, vice president of marketing at Destination Toronto, for their input on the five questions. The goal here is to provide clear structure around AI platforms and processes for DMOs leading up to Matador Network’s collaboration with U.S. Travel at ESTO in Phoenix this fall. Together, we’ll be co-hosting an interactive, multi-station “AI Playground” educational activation during the three days of the conference. Here are the five big AI questions. These will evolve but now we have a foundation to begin building consensus on how DMOs can capitalize on opportunities and navigate challenges with AI today. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The 5 Big AI Questions 1. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? A growing number of DMO leaders say their teams embrace AI for the most part, and many are actively developing basic AI strategy. That’s a significant shift from a year ago. At the same time, there's still varying degrees of cynicism and skepticism about AI in other organizations. I asked Weir about his staff. “I don't feel like we're dragging the team into this,” he said. “It's really more a matter of how people are at such different places with AI. So our goal is figuring out how to channel all their knowledge and energy, and kind of align and unify that, without stifling anyone’s creativity.” Scharf at Visit Denver emphasized that this question should be the first one, because successful AI integration begins with understanding your staff’s grasp of AI and their appetite for leaning into it. “ChatGPT is growing like Zoom did a few years ago so we know we need to use it,” he said. “The first thing we did was survey staff to assess how they feel about AI, and how or if they’re using it. Then we started off with small bites like email. Now we think of AI as a toolkit, and we're continuing to explore what tools are appropriate for different needs.” Port added that AI integration across teams works best with both structured and self-directed learning. “We started by making everything (ChatGPT Plus, Google Gemini) available to everyone, so they were given access to tools and resources, but a lot of this is really self-directed learning,” she said. “What we're seeing now is people have taken advantage of that and moved forward with it. Some maybe a little bit further than others, so maybe we need to address that. I think we still need more use cases and more structured learning because we're not all at the same level in terms of knowing and understanding how to put AI to use.” 2. How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? Destination Toronto was one of the first North American municipal DMOs to develop an AI policy. They began the process by pulling examples from larger government-operated tourism organizations including Destination Canada and Destination British Columbia. “We set up that policy structure first in terms of what we wanted as an organization, and also being very clear that any use of AI was meant to drive business results,” said Weir. “I think we were able to get there pretty quickly because we didn't create a series of regulations. We built a series of philosophies and principles to guide where we go. It was meant to put guardrails around protecting information, while at the same time, stimulate learning and sharing. Because we said to the team that you are free and encouraged to use AI, but there is an expectation that you will share what you've learned.” Port explained further that, “We leveraged existing processes already in place from a content perspective in terms of bias, IT usage, etc. We have an assessment process for any sort of software application that we're looking to use, so we did the same with AI.” (Note: The next GuideGeek Destination AI post will be with Kara Franker, president and CEO of Visit Florida Keys, who is also an attorney. We discussed AI policy at length.) 3. How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? Scharf stated that integrating AI platforms and processes beyond marketing is “where all the work is happening now.” His organization is switching out regular stand up meetings with extended AI workshops and visiting speakers to learn more about AI tools for various use cases across departments. Leadership, he said, including himself, are present at these meetings so everyone is learning together. Weir and Port both addressed this question, saying they need to first explore how Simpleview, Cvent and other tech partners are integrating AI functionality before looking at any new AI platforms. We discussed PCMA’s Project Spark , an AI-native event development tool that includes the new Destinaitor destination sourcing platform. DMO leadership and sales teams are exploring Spark to understand how clients are using new AI software to evaluate, compare and source destinations for business events. Others, like Kara Franker mentioned above, are looking for new AI solutions to optimize their HR and accounting departments, but she said many of the available options presently are only enterprise grade. Something DMOs should really look at, and I’m not sure how/if many already are, but there is proven value in creating custom GPTs for sales teams. GPTs are like mini ChatGPTs designed for specific purposes that anyone with a ChatGPT Plus account can create. For example, a sales rep can build a knowledge base inside a GPT by uploading sales materials, examples of successful bids, product information, pricing, team members, case studies, testimonials and other data. The next step is to develop internal GPT instructions to direct what the GPT does and what it prioritizes. Following that, the rep can then chat with the GPT and ask it to create a customized bid for a potential client that pulls all relevant source materials from the knowledge base that best supports the pitch. I’m imagining the ability to create custom GPTs is going to soon be a standard and required capability for all sales teams. One of the earliest enterprise examples of this was Salesforce’s Einstein GPT, which has since morphed into Agentforce. We use them at Matador because of improved efficiency and quality. GPTs also provide a new option for creative brainstorming, which some salespeople appreciate who don't identify as being super creative. Increases in sales production can be clearly identified. However, there's increasing conversation about tracking success in other departments. When AI delivers clear improvements in efficiency and saves people significant time, how do you measure that? One concern is that people will then just work a six hour day versus eight hours. The common thinking is that organizations will need to adjust productivity benchmarks, but this is a messy conversation. I don’t know enough to comment on that yet, but I wanted to put a pin in it because it’s something we’ll all need to look at eventually as AI scales in the workforce. 4. How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? I was addressing Visit Denver’s Board a while back and one member suggested that DMOs won’t need websites soon because they’ll be replaced by a ChatGPT-like window. I’m surprised by how much this comes up. For one thing, DMOs will always need some kind of online knowledge base for AI search queries. If anything, that will require more content and more comprehensive product information because AI search thrives more than anything on data structure, clarity and specificity. That said, the web user interface will likely evolve considerably. Expect to hear a lot more about how DMOs are developing data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to optimize data structure for AI search. For further context, here's a Perplexity Pro response to the question: "Are tourism boards developing data lakes and warehouses to optimize their sites for AI search?" Weir suggested that this conversation about the future of websites is not unlike what we went through 15 years ago, when people were lamenting the death of DMO sites because social media was deemed by some as the new web. More important, he asserted, is seeing how AI search is evolving and being prepared to adapt strategy. “I think there is a push-pull here between how we lead and where customers are at,” said Weir. “We want to deliver more information through our AI assistant and AI search in general, but customers aren't really there yet. I don't know what the percentage is, but the majority of people are still using Google. They're still beginning an interaction on the web by entering search terms in Google the traditional way. At some point, that's going to flip, right? It's going to be a few percent more each month or quarter, whatever that is. But how far ahead of it do we get? And how do we calibrate? We can try to lead on this, but you know, we also have to stay in step with where our customers are too.” 5. How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? Chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI have dashboards that clearly identify what visitors are asking about in the destination. That helps inform content and product development strategy, and the data is valuable for community engagement. AI chat platforms also operate 24/7 in 50+ languages, which helps DMO influence in-destination travel and spending for a much wider audience than ever before. How to best capitalize on conversational AI, and ultimately conversational commerce, is an evolving topic because we’re still in the early days where travelers are learning they can search with large language models and trust them. ChatGPT has 400 million weekly users but ChatGPT only added full functioning search capability for all users a few months ago. Consumers are just beginning to understand that they can now “talk” to a city. To help accelerate understanding and adoption of AI chat among visitors, Port asserted that the onus is on DMOs to promote their AI chat robustly like any other channel. Weir did that recently by highlighting Destination Toronto’s GuideGeek-powered “6ix” chat platform on LinkedIn, asking, “Ever had a chat directly with a city?” Weir was specifically promoting the organization’s WhatsApp platform, where people can now have a highly personalized, iterative conversation directly with Destination Toronto via the GuideGeek AI integration. The same functionality exists with the other Meta platforms, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. A few hours after Weir's post I received a Slack message from our CTO Stefan Klopp wondering what was going on in Toronto. WhatsApp volume was spiking, he said, and he was asking if Toronto had sent out a press release promoting 6ix, or something. No, it was just a quick CEO social media post. Also, Tourism New Zealand just launched a new campaign in collaboration with “A Minecraft Movie” that integrates GuideGeek-powered prompt questions to trigger further engagement. So, those are just a couple examples of how DMO/NTOs can drive AI chat engagement. The question for Weir and Port though is about the types of questions people are asking in AI chat platforms. Presently, a lot of the chat conversations are more utilitarian, related to queries about hotels, restaurants, attractions, events, directions, etc. So as conversational AI adoption increases, will DMOs focus more on developing content that answers those basic types of questions, like what hotel, restaurant or attraction is highly rated, and how to get there. Or, should DMOs continue to focus mainly on developing what is generally perceived as more inspirational destination and experiential content? "The question then becomes about responding to inquiries versus the inspirational side," explained Port. "Like, all of these articles, all of this content that we serve up, that is not in response to a question per se. It's more packaged to inspire people. I think a lot of that's going to have to exist outside our environments, maybe, whether it's influencers, it's your earned media strategy, it's content partnerships, things like that. That's where I think the inspiration will exist. But we really have to move to being more of the informative one, on our website or whatever a website is. But it needs to be very specific in answering questions. We already see that on GuideGeek." Weir summed up, saying, "I think this ends up relating more to, again, that question of where the customers are. Are we putting ourselves in a position to answer their questions and deliver the information in the way they're looking for it, using AI and the data lake approach? Or, are we curators like we've always been, inspiring visitors with local experiences, or is the customer now the curator by virtue of how they're asking questions today?" Summary These five takeaways are aligned with the five big AI questions. AI adoption begins with talking to DMO staff to understand what the organization is working with. Love the idea about marrying structured and self-directed learning, and being intentional about that with staff. At some point, for AI adoption to scale and continually evolve on an ongoing basis, there needs to be AI leaders in any organization who pick up the torch and inspire their colleagues to lean into AI. Otherwise, things tend to plateau with the same people using the same AI models. AI policy is intended to encourage staff to innovate with AI as much as it's meant to protect organizations. AI is the death of "I don't know," so it can benefit all staff in all departments. That in itself is enough ROI to validate initial investments in AI. The tools can provide a foundation of knowledge and direction for problem solving and strategic planning exponentially better than traditional search. Some organizations, like Visit Greece who we work with, have phenomenal website data structure ideally optimized for AI search. Meanwhile, one CEO told me "Our website is a mess with outdated content and poor data structure. We need to rebuild from scratch with AI search top of mind." Chat is the new marketplace, and AI is eating the entire funnel including in-destination. Moreover, AI chat data provides DMO leaders with insights into what visitors are asking about. Although, I think as chat adoption scales mainstream, the conversations will evolve beyond asking for a good hotel or restaurant. Greg Oates

Why Small Steps With AI Create Big Wins for Tourism Organizations Sep 22 Written By Greg Oates Key Theme: How to Align Strategic Risk Management and Progressive AI Implementation The rush to transform everything with AI has dominated boardroom discussions since ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Yet the most successful organizations aren't pursuing wholesale AI overhauls. They're taking calculated, incremental steps that deliver real value while building capabilities for the future. MIT researchers interviewed senior managers at 21 large companies actively using generative AI. Their findings challenge the prevailing narrative about AI transformation. Companies are deliberately choosing "small t" transformations over risky, large-scale implementations. This approach works particularly well for tourism organizations where customer trust and regulatory compliance matter deeply. Tourism organizations face unique challenges with AI adoption. Customer data privacy concerns run high. Regulatory requirements vary across jurisdictions. Service quality directly impacts reputation. The research reveals that successful companies treat AI implementation like climbing a risk slope. They start with low-risk internal applications before moving to customer-facing solutions. This measured approach isn't about being timid. It's about being smart. Tourism CEOs can build organizational confidence, develop necessary skills, and demonstrate tangible value before tackling more complex implementations. Start With Universal Productivity Tools That Employees Already Want to Use The research uncovered a surprising reality. Employees were already using ChatGPT and other public AI tools without permission. Companies responded by providing secure, private versions of these tools. This grassroots adoption pattern offers tourism organizations a clear starting point. Consider how your marketing team writes destination descriptions. Your operations staff creates training materials. Your finance team prepares reports. These tasks consume hours of employee time across every department. Private AI instances from providers like ChatGPT or Claude eliminate security concerns while boosting productivity. McKinsey built a custom platform called Lilli that connects AI to 40 internal knowledge sources. The result? Seventy-five percent employee adoption in under a year. Time savings up to 30%. Substantially improved work quality. Tourism organizations don't need to build something this sophisticated initially. Even basic AI writing assistants can transform daily work. Microsoft Copilot integration takes this further. Employees can search across company documents instantly. They can pull content from emails, meeting transcripts, and presentations. One manager described it as having "a super search engine" for company information. Imagine your team finding that obscure policy document from three years ago in seconds rather than hours. The beauty of starting here? Minimal risk. Maximum adoption. Employees want these tools. They're probably already using consumer versions. Providing enterprise versions addresses security concerns while meeting existing demand. Your IT team maintains control. Your employees get productivity gains. Everyone wins. Some employees will still seek external tools for specific needs. One product manager uses Midjourney for quick visuals. Another uses voice-to-text tools for performance reviews. Accept this reality. Focus on providing core tools internally while establishing clear guidelines for external tool usage. Deploy AI for Specific Roles While Keeping Humans in Control Once basic AI tools gain traction, tourism organizations can target specific job functions. The key insight from the research? Maintain human oversight for quality control. This "human in the loop" approach reduces risk while capturing efficiency gains. Customer service represents an ideal starting point for tourism organizations. AI can help agents find information quickly. It can suggest responses in real time. It can analyze call patterns to identify coaching opportunities. MIT researchers found AI coaching tools increased call center productivity by 14% on average. New and low-skilled workers improved by 34%. Morgan Stanley equipped financial advisors with an AI assistant trained on over one million internal documents. The tool doesn't replace advisors. It helps them find information faster so they can focus on customer relationships. Tourism organizations can apply this same principle. Help your concierge staff access local recommendations instantly. Enable tour guides to answer obscure historical questions accurately. Support reservation agents with instant access to availability across properties. CarMax demonstrates another powerful application. The company uses AI to generate descriptions for over 5,000 car pages. Manual creation would take multiple humans 11 years. With AI, it takes hours. The 80% approval rate from editorial review proves quality doesn't suffer. Tourism organizations can apply this to property descriptions, tour summaries, and destination guides. Creative teams at Dentsu use AI throughout their workflow. From proposals to budgeting to ideation. The emerging technology director noted employees spend less time on mundane tasks. They create higher-quality content with less effort. Tourism marketing teams can similarly accelerate campaign development, social media content creation, and promotional material design. Finance departments traditionally resist new technology. Yet some organizations successfully use AI for audit reports, regulatory compliance, and fraud detection. Amazon's finance team reports employees shifted from repetitive tasks to critical thinking work. Tourism organizations can start with expense report processing or invoice matching before tackling complex financial analysis. Transform Customer Experiences Gradually With Clear Boundaries Customer-facing AI sits highest on the risk slope. Yet the potential rewards justify careful exploration. The research shows companies succeeding by setting clear boundaries and expanding gradually. Chatbots evolved from frustrating phone trees to sophisticated conversational agents. John Hancock's insurance chatbots handle common queries effectively. Human agents focus on complex issues. Starbucks, Domino's, and CVS expanded to voice interactions. Video interactions come next. Tourism organizations can start with FAQ chatbots on their websites. Add booking assistance once that works well. Expand to voice-based concierge services when ready. Personalization transforms online shopping experiences. Tapestry, parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, uses real-time language modifications. The conversational tone mimics in-store associates. Revenue increased at least 3%. Tourism organizations can personalize trip recommendations based on past bookings. Adjust website content for different traveler segments. Customize email campaigns for individual preferences. Software companies already embed AI throughout their products. Adobe users create and modify images effortlessly. Canva simplifies presentation creation. Lucidchart converts text descriptions into flowcharts. Tourism organizations benefit as their existing software vendors add AI features. Property management systems will suggest optimal pricing. Booking platforms will predict cancellation risks. Marketing tools will automate campaign optimization. The key? Start small. Test thoroughly. Expand gradually. A failed internal productivity tool frustrates employees. A failed customer-facing AI damages your brand. Move up the risk slope deliberately. Build Foundational Capabilities Before Attempting Major Transformations The research revealed an uncomfortable truth. Scaling AI from pilot to production is harder than expected. Data quality issues multiply. Edge cases appear more frequently. Integration challenges compound. Many organizations discovered they needed stronger foundations before pursuing ambitious AI projects. CarMax's chief information officer emphasized data quality. "Good data will give you good results from AI." Poor data produces unreliable outputs. Tourism organizations must audit their data systems. Customer records across multiple systems need reconciliation. Historical booking data requires cleaning. Property information needs standardization. Governance structures matter equally. Who approves AI projects? How do you measure success? What happens when AI makes mistakes? Establish these frameworks before scaling implementations. Small pilots can proceed without perfect governance. Enterprise deployments cannot. Capital One's chief scientist warned against the "gold-rush mentality." Thoughtful, responsible implementation beats rushed deployment. Build the scaffolding to bring everyone along. Tourism organizations should resist pressure to match competitors' AI announcements. Focus on sustainable progress over headlines. Management buy-in proves essential for larger projects. One technology company's AI efforts stagnated until the CEO personally championed them. Small wins build credibility for bigger investments. Document productivity gains from initial deployments. Share customer satisfaction improvements. Make the business case concrete before requesting major funding. Summary: Small Transformations Today Enable Big Transformations Tomorrow The research delivers a clear message for tourism CEOs. Successful AI implementation doesn't require revolutionary change. It requires evolutionary progress. Start with universal productivity tools that employees already want. Target specific roles with human oversight. Transform customer experiences within careful boundaries. Build foundational capabilities systematically. This approach particularly suits tourism organizations. Your business depends on human connections. Technology should enhance these connections, not replace them. Your customers value authentic experiences. AI should enable better experiences, not artificial ones. Your reputation takes years to build and moments to destroy. Measured AI deployment protects what you've built while enabling future growth. The companies studied aren't waiting for perfect AI solutions. They're using today's technology to solve real problems while preparing for tomorrow's possibilities. They're training employees, cleaning data, and establishing governance. When breakthrough AI capabilities arrive, they'll be ready to capitalize quickly. Tourism organizations can follow this same path. Deploy AI writing assistants next month. Add customer service chatbots next quarter. Enhance personalization next year. Each step builds on the last. Each success enables the next. Small transformations compound into competitive advantage. The AI transformation race isn't won by the fastest starter. It's won by consistent, strategic progress. Tourism CEOs who embrace "small t" transformation today position their organizations for "big T" transformation tomorrow. The journey starts with a single step up the risk slope. Greg Oates

How to Develop AI Strategy for Your Organization Oct 12 Written By Greg Oates The 2050 City AI Roadmap provides a high-level strategic framework for how DMOs and other organizations can capitalize on AI to optimize internal operations, resources and knowledge, and ultimately, drive partner revenue. DMOs have all kinds of strategic plans, master plans, business and marketing plans, etc. The 2050 City AI Roadmap outlines the process to develop your AI strategic plan. It defines the big picture outlook for AI as the future of commerce, and it proposes a methodology to help DMO leaders prioritize, organize and navigate how they go about integrating AI across their organization. Presently, we're rolling this out with Visit Mesa , Tourism Richmond in British Columbia, and The Florida Keys & Key West . The three CEOs for those organizations have all agreed to share takeaways and business outcomes with each others' teams to cross-pollinate learning and accelerate AI process integration. That spirit of knowledge sharing and co-learning for me is huge, because we as an industry are all pretty much flying blindly with AI from a macro perspective. Yes, we've come a long way in the last year. Every DMO CEO I talk to these days is now implementing various AI processes and seeing value. However, we're all kind of flying this plane while we're building it at the same time, and we don't really have a destination, or even due north, in mind. The 2050 City AI Roadmap was designed to identify where we're going with this emergent technology that's both incredibly powerful and often highly unpredictable. It also defines how high-end AI chat platforms, like Matador Network's GuideGeek AI , are the tip of the spear for agentic commerce. The following guidelines are based on experience in the workplace to deliver new value with AI for your team, board, industry partners and community stakeholders. Internal & External Direction Every decision related to AI strategy should first be defined through an internal or external lens. Your board members will typically view internal workplace optimization as tactical. Externally, AI integrations that are consumer-facing and revenue generating are usually perceived as more strategic. Internal Facing From an internal standpoint, the focus of the AI Roadmap is on optimizing operations to take advantage of an organization's aggregate of resources and knowledge. Imagine the totality of insights across every team member in terms of their expertise and networks in their communities. AI systems are designed to pool and capitalize on that, but only if an organization's knowledge base is structured intelligently. That means rebuilding your folder structures and files naming conventions so an AI can find everything. According to Slack, workers spend 41% of their time on menial tasks, including endless hours just looking for information. The overall losses related to productivity, quality of work and workplace, and physical/mental health are crazy. So let's start there with AI strategy to address our internal digital dumpster fire. External Facing Externally, from a marketing, sales and visitor/partner engagement perspective, AI strategy begins with integrating a robust AI chat platform like GuideGeek. DMOs have never really had proprietary information on who their visitors are. They have geo-location, credit card spend, event attendance data, etc., which show visitor behavior. But none of those really identify visitor motivations and mindsets indepth. With an AI chat platform, DMOs can now pull analytics showing what visitors are actually asking and what they want to know on an individual and aggregate basis. We launched our new GuideGeek V2 analytics dashboard this past week, which provides deeper, fuller insights into visitor psychographics. That data then informs all kinds of resource allocation decisions related to content development, AI SEO strategy, data analysis, product and destination development, community engagement, etc. CEO Roles AI is best defined as a new digital "co-intelligence" that can communicate, reason and create for the first time ever, versus just another new technology. We emphasize that AI is really a new environment for collaboration more than anything, just not solely among humans anymore. Learning AI is not like learning Photoshop. You can only "teach" AI up to a point, like trying to teach someone how to ride a bike. You can't teach a child how to stay on two wheels without falling in a classroom. He or she actually has to start pedaling, and eventually the child's mind and body basically have a conversation, so to speak, with the bike to grasp the fundamentals of moving forward successfully. Same with AI. The only way to learn AI is to use AI. Helping human teams embrace this new co-intelligence (and it's not like there's a choice) falls under the umbrella of change management. That's a CEO's wheelhouse. It will take more than a few years for many humans to reconcile their minds and values with this new relationship, and it falls on the CEO's shoulders to steward that reconciliation. Likewise, CEOs oversee AI governance, policy and privacy. I've shared before how AI governance should be viewed less like a car brake and more like a steering wheel to inform, direct and accelerate AI adoption and integration. Lastly, only CEOs can scale long-term AI benefits and business outcomes effectively. You can't really delegate this. AI efforts will plateau at times, some or many AI experimentations will fail, and there are always staff members who will drag their feet because they just don't like AI. DMO CEOs are chief people officers and it's on them to create the right culture for scaling AI platforms and processes effectively for everyone in their crews. Agentic AI This is where things get interesting. AI agents and agentic commerce might sound super confusing for many or most staff members. Lots of land mines to watch out for, sure, but even more reasons for us building a macro DMO AI strategic framework. One of the key objectives for the AI Roadmap is to elevate AI agents and agentic commerce as the two interrelated cornerstones for AI strategy, and explain why. Doing so shows the true big picture value of AI, and it drives home how we eventually need to move way beyond training people the basics of prompting. Yes, it's intimidating, but we introduce the labels and contexts relating to agentic AI early on in the process. That gets some people thinking bigger about AI, and it entices the AI champions in the group to start experimenting with agents. AI Agents (Internal) For internal AI strategy, leading DMOs are developing AI agents and automated workflows to address the aforementioned 41% of time that staff members spend on grunt work and trying to find information. They are proven, they work, and most of all, they deliver measurable ROI. We're working with outside contractors at Matador to develop and implement agents and automations for both ourselves internally and for DMO clients. We are already seeing success, and there's been a recent influx among our people asking for agents. It's an amazing thing to see when staff members start requesting new AI integrations like that, proactively. That's when you know your AI strategy is working at least on some level. Agentic Commerce (External) AI agents are also the foundation for agentic commerce. According to Mastercard , "Agentic commerce is a new form of online and mobile shopping, in which an AI agent 'closes the loop' or completes tasks for a user — such as searching for items, comparing options and making a purchase — with limited or no manual inputs needed from that user. For example, while chatting in a generative AI app, you could tell the AI agent, 'Book me a nonstop flight to London for under $600 next week — no red-eyes,' and the agent will review airlines, nearby airports and your loyalty memberships and payment card rewards to identify the best option, purchase it and then share it with you." Just like with AI agents, developing agentic commerce architecture covers a wide spectrum of sophistication and capabilities. Going back to the analogy of flying a plane while building it with no clear final destination in mind, agentic commerce is the point on the map where we want to land. With GuideGeek, we have Kayak, GetYourGuide, Skyscanner and other booking tools integrated into the platform with a click-through UX/UI. Looking ahead, we're working with one national tourism organization to bring some of their national partners' booking engines (air, hotel, tour op, etc.,) into the platform to eventually convert sales in-chat. Subscribe to Mastercard Signals to keep up-to-date on agentic commerce and access intelligence like this Mastercard Payments Trends Navigator report. Staff Training & AI Integration Training staff and implementing AI processes across all departments is really the meat of the 2050 City Roadmap. But none of that should proceed without DMO leadership embracing all the above, and communicating it clearly to all staff. Easier said than done, though. Leadership needs to continually communicate a high-level approach to AI strategy, because it won't really click for many staff (or leadership) at the beginning of this process. That, of course, needs to be married with all the practical training initiatives we're continuing to develop. We've already learned a ton with the present work we're doing training DMO teams. Here are a few very basic takeaways just to start explaining our process. There are obviously many more educational modules following these, ranging from predictive analytics to specific department AI training in areas like HR, finance and legal. Conduct an internal AI survey asking all staff to share their perceptions and usage of AI. Follow that up with small group interviews across the organization, and transcribe everything with an AI notetaker. We use Granola, but there are many others. Also, explain to staff that all meetings regarding AI will be recorded to create an internal knowledge base to identify opportunities, challenges and takeaways over time. Start training with a focus on just the paid/pro models of ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. Some staff feel confused with the sheer variety of available AI tools in front of them. We explain that, at the end of the day, the basics of using AI include an end user, an AI tool, and a knowledge base. Get people on board with that, and then show how most of the AI tools they have access to are similar in many ways. One of the fastest methods to advance AI understanding is showing staff how to create custom GPTs in ChatGPT. Some team members will pick up on these quickly and start integrating them into their workflows right away. These are the people who typically make up your internal AI taskforce. Explain and show how Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot are AI workhorses that connect with the majority of people's daily workflows. However, humans tend to think of those as just the next evolution of search engines. This is mental wiring that needs to be broken. Gemini and Copilot are great/good in some ways, but I've found that training staff on just those three native LLMs first (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) is more effective for seeing the light. Google NotebookLM has a lot of fans. I like to walk teams through it because it's a good way to reinforce what a knowledge base is, like we do with the custom GPTs. Also, the automated audio and video podcasts are crowd pleasers, especially with the new Join function where users can engage directly with the agentic podcast hosts. People don't seem to want to read anymore. This was a rude awakening for us when we first launched the AI Roadmap with a series of online training materials. We now know we need to deliver short video instruction if we want anyone to actually look at the educational content. People love Descript for AI-powered video creation. Once we started showing how to use Descript, we were pleasantly surprised to see how staff really leaned in. Teaching Descript provides a fun break early in the process because people can see pretty amazing results in minutes and wrap their minds around the process fairly easily. Ask all staff to share how they're using AI effectively and where they see AI failing them. Catalogue the case studies and share across the organization to accelerate learning, inspire a healthy sense of internal competition, and track learning over time. Staff members are also often wowed seeing AI agents in action. We use n8n to develop agents, where you can create a lot of basic automated workflows quickly. Once a few early adopters see how agents can take over some of their more tedious, time-consuming tasks, others will jump in. Feedback Loop & Funding/Board Support This line in the AI Roadmap is broken down into tactical internal optimization and more strategic, consumer-facing and revenue-generating sales, marketing and stakeholder engagement. I don't have a lot to share for this section and the following one because our focus to date has been mostly on the above phases. Feedback Loop The reason we record every engagement with AI Roadmap clients is to scale learning, so if one person learns something, everyone can benefit. That will be further multiplied when we starting sharing takeaways across DMOS, and eventually the industry as a whole. Visit Mesa, Tourism Richmond and Visit Florida Keys are eager to lead this initiative, and we plan to launch a new AI thought leadership framework collectively in 2026. Funding & Board Support The spark that led to developing the AI Roadmap happened almost a year ago when a board member for a large DMO told me that she viewed AI integration as merely a tactic. If this work can elevate AI in the minds of board members toward a more high-level strategic imperative, then we'll have achieved part of our mission. There's still some work to be done first though to collect more case studies showing direct AI business outcomes before we can make a more solid case for additional funding for AI integrations. AI Strategic Plan We've produced a mockup of what we think an AI Strategic Plan will eventually look like, but it's too early to show presently. For now, we've identified three overarching pillars, each with potential strategies, action items, timelines and targets. The KPIs are crucial, of course, for scaling AI strategy across the travel industry. Right now, we're thinking the three pillars might look like the following, although this is all up in the air right now: Optimize Internal Operations & Knowledge: The strategies include cleaning up internal folders/files to improve AI outcomes in general and develop AI agents specifically. A lot in here on training, experimentation, overall adoption, success measures, etc. Increase Partner Revenue with Agentic AI: Defining how DMOs develop AI agents to fuel agentic commerce is the big goal overall with the AI Roadmap. Initial strategies in this pillar begin with more low hanging fruit though, such as website redevelopment, optimizing for AI SEO, AI chat integration, etc. Expand Community Collaboration: We're seeing more DMOs take a leading role in AI education for their industry and community stakeholders. The 2050 City Roadmap is perfectly suited for informing how DMO leaders can facilitate community AI workshops and increase the organization's overall relevance and value. Greg Oates

Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Kara Franker , president and CEO of The Florida Keys & Key West tourism organization, was among the first DMO leaders to embrace AI platforms and processes in 2023 when she was chief executive at Visit Estes Park in Colorado. In May 2024, Franker published two papers on AI strategy and policy: From the Base of the Rocky Mountains to the World: A case study through Visit Estes Park’s journey into Generative AI solutions — and how your DMO can carve its own AI path Navigating AI and the Law in the Travel Industry: An Introduction to Legal Implications for DMOs The first paper highlights how Visit Estes Park integrated GuideGeek AI chat into their website and three Meta platforms: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The DMO also branded the chat Rocky Mountain Roamer to give it an identity and bit of personality. The second paper focused on AI policy and data privacy, security and compliance. Franker, who is an attorney, co-wrote that with Roxanne Steinhoff , also an attorney at Steinhoff Law, who leads the firm’s destination marketing and sports tourism practice. I caught up with Franker to see how her perspectives on AI strategy and policy are evolving almost a year later. Greg Oates: You've been leading AI strategy in tourism for almost two years beginning with your work at Visit Estes Park. However, there’s still a lack of AI training today specific for DMO CEOs, and many leaders are presently unsure how to proceed with AI. As a CEO, what’s your take on that? Kara Franker: I'm not surprised that there's a lack of training because there's just so much for everybody to wrap their heads around. I think some people are trying to watch and wait and see. My philosophy has been more of a fall-forward, fail-forward kind of approach. That's why I put the white papers out. Anybody could learn from what we had done, and do it better. You know, a case study is sometimes the best way to figure this stuff out, so that's why we did it. The second paper on AI policy was with Roxanne Steinhoff on the legal and ethical implications of AI. Because when I would go and speak in front of groups, those were always the big questions from the leadership. They don't know how far is too far once you open this can of worms. That's why we got together and started to put guardrails in place that we thought might make sense for people to study, just as a first stab at it. That all launched last summer, so I do think that there's a little bit of education out there but we could definitely use more. GO: What do DMOs need to know about AI policy at a very high level in terms of privacy and security? KF: Employee and client information should be kept private and not uploaded into any AI tools. That could be a big deal, thinking of all the different rules and regulations about collecting information, especially how it's more stringent in Europe than in the United States. That can cause potential problems if you're uploading, say, a client list that has personal cell phones, email addresses or other information that people just don't want out there. So, it's really more about information that's attached to a person. And then, is there competitive data that you don't necessarily want others to have? Possibly, but so much of what we do in the DMO space is public anyways so the lines for that are pretty blurry. I’m trying to imagine a scenario where a DMO is, like, basically hacking somebody else's information through AI. I can’t imagine that’s worth the time and effort, or even possible. GO: A few months ago we were discussing what AI tools might be available for DMO departments like HR and accounting to help with privacy, compliance, efficiency, etc. But everything available seems to be enterprise grade and out of reach for DMOs. So what’s the answer for scaling AI across an organization? KF: I think this is a huge need. I hired somebody from Cisco who’s my new VP of technology and partnerships. She's a total AI nerd like I am, and way more qualified to dive into all this. She and I have been looking at different options to put together, almost like little plugins. We really, really need this. For example, how do we take an AI solution from the legal world to analyze all our contracts so that we don't have to spend as many hours with attorneys, because we really just need a template, right? And then for HR, same thing. How do we organize all our employee files into a much more streamlined and effective system? And then there’s our policies. We're a nonprofit but everything we do is so heavily influenced by County government. We have so many compliance issues, so I want an AI to learn every single piece of County policies so we’re able to compare and contrast what we're doing with those policies. I haven't been able to find anything to help with these things. We've looked at a lot of different options but it's like what you're saying. They're these big enterprise pieces built for law firms or financial people, and they’re all really expensive. None of them fit the mold for improving different operations at a DMO. In my mind, the marketing side is covered, especially with GuideGeek, and there are so many great options now for everything involved with marketing. So I feel like that's been tackled and done really well. But for the operations, we need more. I mean, we’ve just got to keep digging deeper, I think. GO: When you and your technology person from Cisco figure all this out, will you share what you find with the rest of us? KF: Of course, always. GO: Backing up a bit, you were arguably the very first DMO CEO to lean into AI, at least in North America, when you were with Visit Estes Park. How did you convince your board that investing in AI was important at the time, and what were some of your processes with bringing along staff? KF: We were fortunate in the sense that the board was all in and the staff were all in. And I don't mean to make age a part of it, but the staff was a little on the young side and they were all very ambitious. Everybody wanted to try to figure it out. So we made the argument to the board, if we could figure out some of what AI could do, it would make the community stronger and they could take pieces of it back to their businesses. There wasn't really anybody who was against experimenting and trying it out. We made some mistakes along the way and we put that in the white paper. Also, when we first rolled out GuideGeek, which scrapes the website, we found a few holes in our content. There were particular board members who didn't have very robust information about their business, so they got a little bit mad, but not in a, like, burn it down way. It was more of, "Oh, okay, we have some work to do." So part of the AI process has to actually be community outreach. It can't just be about the technology. We have to talk to all our partners and get really robust information from them, so when the AI crawls the site it gets the best possible information about our partners. GO: One thing you did at Visit Estes Park was brand your GuideGeek AI as Rocky Mountain Roamer on your website and three Meta platforms. We use that as a case study a lot, and emphasize that a DMO should promote their AI just like any other channel, right? KF: Definitely. We knew we had to put money behind marketing the tool if we wanted people to interact with it. Traditionally with a DMO, one of your calls to action is to send people to the website. Our new call to action for a lot of our campaigns back then was to send people to the AI, so we called it Rocky Mountain Roamer to help promote and drive traffic to it. And then in terms of KPIs, we wanted to track all the interactions you can see in the backend, but not just how many people used it. We wanted to know how long people interacted with the AI, what their journey was, and what they were asking about because that’s where things get really interesting. GO: After the initial thrill of launching GuideGeek, how did you manage how staff used AI internally? Were there any incentives involved to help spur adoption and experimentation? KF: The incentive for my team was, well, it wasn't really an incentive. It was a requirement. They had to write weekly reports for me about how they tested something with AI, whatever it was. It could apply to their job or not, I didn't really care. So I almost forced them to try AI. But then people started really getting into it. They were getting more and more user friendly with different AI tools, and they would be like, “Oh, I like Anthropic because of this or that,” because they were branching out from just using ChatGPT. So, yeah, there has to be almost like a culture of AI in your DMO for it to really work, and it's on the CEO to create and foster that. Greg Oates

Join Matador Network's AI Playground at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Matador Network, GuideGeek AI and U.S. Travel are launching the inaugural "AI Playground" at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix, August 17-19. The educational space, hands-on demo area, genius bar and live sessions will run all three days during the conference. We are also producing programming specific for travel industry CEOs, along with other sessions dedicated for senior executives, highlighting actionable AI strategies focusing on real world business outcomes. Leading up to ESTO, I'll be reaching out to many of you requesting any AI-related success stories and/or questions you might have for the AI Playground. Looking back over the last two years, it's clear the industry is turning a corner in 2025 when it comes to AI learning and adoption. Many DMOs and their industry partners are now integrating AI processes and platforms across their organizations, whereas last year many destination leaders were still in wait-and-see mode. For those of you still on the fringes, it is our ambition that the AI Playground will plant a flag in the ground showing how AI is now a proven strategy for helping DMOs further deliver on their mandate. "AI is clearly powering the future of travel and how people explore the world today," says Ross Borden, founder and CEO of Matador Network. "We are stoked to be working with U.S. Travel and investing in our industry to produce the AI Playground. AI will become standard operating procedure for every DMO soon, and we're excited to help lead this journey." DMO CEOs on AI Strategy Matador launched its proprietary GuideGeek AI chat platform for DMO websites and social media channels almost two years ago. We now have more than 40 DMOs onboard, and we're expanding the scope of GuideGeek AI with new hotel groups and tour operators joing in recent months. Based on our experience working with municipal, regional and national organizations across the global visitor industry, we have unparalleled insights into how conversational AI is changing the relationship between destinations and visitors, as well as how DMOs operate internally. In preparation for ESTO 2025, we launched this GuideGeek Destination AI newsletter in January to ramp up our industry outreach and further expand our understanding of how DMO leaders are navigating the rise of AI. Here are five stories from the newsletter that inform high-level decision making related to AI strategy, with input from more than 15 CEO DMOs: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI : Our first post with 12 DMO CEOs highlighted the wide range of questions they have. One asked for the five big AI questions he should know about. Another wants practical advice on five AI initiatives that he can implement, like, tomorrow. Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism : CEO Royce Chwin, who helms Destination Vancouver, shared why his organization was one of the first DMOs in the world to dive into AI. Destination Toronto & Visit Denver CEOs on the 5 Big AI Questions in Tourism : Two chief executives, Andrew Weir in Toronto and Richard Scharf in Denver, worked out what they believe are the five big AI themes/questions that DMOs need to focus on, as touched on in the first post. Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation : Newly installed Florida Keys CEO Kara Franker, who is also an attorney, shed light on AI policy, compliance and the need for more non-enterprise AI solutions for her organization. Visit Mesa CEO Launches New DMO AI Road Map : Another visionary DMO chief executive, Visit Mesa leader Marc Garcia is bringing a new level of structure and direction for integrating AI processes and platforms. Next up, Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau, will be discussing AI strategy from a business events perspective. I also met with Cody Chomiak, vice president of marketing at Travel Manitoba, who's really lighting a fire in Canada around AI thought leadership and adoption. He'll be sharing a few powerful AI case studies from his provincial marketing organization, both internal and visitor-facing. AI Playground at ESTO 2025 The AI Playground this year will feature three stations at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge . We will have our Matador GuideGeek team and U.S. Travel staff on hand to guide participants through the space, along with some invited AI experts from around the industry. We'll be digging into a handful of paid AI models including ChatGPT Plus/Teams, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro, Google AI Pro, Microsoft Copilot Pro and Manus. We'll show how AI is best navigated at DMOs by bucketing strategy into three unique categories: Search, Create and Sales. Specific use cases will include content generation and data analysis, AI SEO and AI-optimized web development, AI policy and governance, staff adoption, building custom GPTs for sales proposals, and automated workflows and AI agents, among others. The three stations are: The Prompt Lab welcomes all attendees to come in and test drive various AI models. The interactive, hands-on learning station will have multiple laptops for experimenting with AI tools for people of all skill levels. We'll have a bunch of paid AI models pre-loaded for live demos and one-on-one conversations showing how AI actually works and some of what it accomplishes across different departments. Feel free to bring your own laptop if you like. The Genius Bar is designed for individual and group Q&A about real world AI strategy, implementation and ROI. We'll be collecting all the questions posed to share with the broader industry afterward, so we'll have a couple crowdsourcing boards to help generate new ideas and explore new solutions. Reach out to me if you want to schedule time to talk during ESTO. The AI Theater seating area will host a range of AI-focused dialogues, micro-presentations and a few dedicated sessions designed for CEOs, as well as other senior executives. The programming schedule for all those will engagements be included in the ESTO agenda. Most importantly, all the conversations at the AI Playground will highlight tangible AI case studies and specific business outcomes. The 5 Big Questions About AI One of the best things to come out of all the interviews with DMO CEOs this year is our list of the five big AI questions that chief executives need to focus on. These questions will likely evolve a bit, but for now they're providing direction for how we're developing the AI Playground and how DMOs are moving forward with AI integration. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? I would love to hear your feedback on any the above and how we can make the ESTO 2025 AI Playground as valuable as possible for you and your teams. Reach out at greg@matadornetwork.com . Greg Oates

Visit Mesa CEO Launches New AI Roadmap Aug 25 Written By Greg Oates Visit Mesa in Arizona kicked off a new internal initiative this week to integrate AI processes and platforms across the organization. I worked with Visit Mesa to help develop their new DMO AI Roadmap, which provides a 5-phase strategic framework that most any visitor organization can use as a template. The project officially began this week during Visit Mesa’s spring board meeting to communicate why the organization is moving forward with AI to optimize the DMO’s value for Mesa’s visitor industry and the local community. Marc Garcia, CATP , president and CEO of Visit Mesa, has been eager to start this initiative. He was one of the dozen CEOs who contributed to the first GuideGeek Destination AI story a few months back, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI. For that deep dive into a CEO's mindset regarding AI, Garcia asked: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” The Visit Mesa DMO AI Roadmap answers those questions. “I've recognized that AI is extremely important not only for the world moving forward, but specifically for our industry,” Garcia explained at the beginning of this project. “We at Visit Mesa need to get out in front of it. Even as a small to medium-sized DMO with our budget, we've always taken pride in the fact that we’re typically at the forefront of the latest and greatest in terms of technology, and so this is just an extension of that.” The following is a high-level overview of the DMO AI Roadmap and each of the five phases. However, like all strategic planning, there is a big jump between developing a plan and executing it effectively. This is especially true with internal AI training. In any given organization today, there is often a wide breadth of how people perceive AI and how proficient they are with AI models. It will take time to educate and align everyone around shared benefits for the organizations and staff, expected processes, intended outcomes and success metrics. Visit Mesa AI Roadmap The DMO AI Roadmap is a structured, phased approach for educating staff and integrating AI across DMO departments. The goals for the roadmap are to optimize internal operations, enhance sales and marketing outcomes, inspire staff self-learning, future-proof the organization, and contribute to how well local industry and community leaders adopt AI best practices and benefit from them. There are two imperatives that should be established and agreed upon among leadership at the very beginning. Integrating AI processes and platforms is an imperative for the DMO to ensure its relevancy and long-term impact in the local visitor economy. If leadership doesn’t fully believe that, this strategic framework won’t work. AI proficiency is an imperative for staff members for their future growth and marketability. That said, you can’t really force people to embrace, learn and use AI intentionally, but the job market will. The following phases are highly fluid and some of the processes can be rolled out concurrently. Ultimately, these phases provide structure for effectively and responsibly implementing a new technology that has no precedent. Because of generative AI, machines can now do three things they haven’t been able to do before. They have the ability to reason, the ability to communicate, and the ability to generate stuff based on that reasoning and communication. Meaning, AI is messy. Integrating it into our daily workflows is also messy because it's challenging us to rethink our relationship with technology. But as Kate Yordi, director of marketing at Visit Mesa, said during the board meeting this week, “Finally, we have some direction.” Phase 1: Leadership Alignment & Staff Communication As discussed at length in previous Destination AI posts, the DMO CEO must make it clear to all staff that the organization prioritizes AI because the organization prioritizes being relevant. It certainly helps, as is the case with Visit Mesa, when the CEO is fully backed by the board to invest in AI integration. During the board meeting, one member asked, “What do you need from us, Marc?” That’s a good sign. For the DMO AI Roadmap to work, all leadership needs to not only have a basic understanding of AI tools, they need to actually use them as well on a regular basis. That goes a long way in driving agency across the organization. However, making that happen typically requires some C-suite training to explain the primary AI models more indepth: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot and/or Google Gemini depending on the specific workplace platform(s) the organization uses. Identifying and prioritizing just a handful of AI models like that brings a lot of clarity to the process right off the bat. You see people's shoulders relax when they're confronted with 5-6 AIs versus dozens. (Yes, VEED, Gamma, Manus, Sora, Granola, Slack AI, etc., are all really cool but let's not start there.) A common lament among DMO leadership related to AI is, “Where do we even start?” Leadership should then discuss and begin to answer the five big questions all CEOs face when navigating AI integration, as vetted in the aforementioned Destination AI post about what CEOs want regarding AI education: How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI (who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI) to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and quality of work? How do we redevelop our content and channels to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI for business purposes to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The next step in this phase, at a basic level, is communicating to staff why they’re being asked to embrace AI. The following is not meant to be comprehensive, but a CEO would likely want to articulate: The purpose of the AI Roadmap, guiding principles, and the phases and processes involved How AI integration will take time and people will evolve at different paces It’s ok if everyone feels like they’re building the plane while flying it Everyone is encouraged to use AI and will be supported, but there will also be guardrails in place AI adoption and use cases will become part of employee reviews, but traditional roles, responsibilities and key success metrics are still the priority "How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents." — Marc Garcia, president and CEO, Visit Mesa Phase 2: Staff Assessment & AI Task Force Sitting down and asking staff how they feel about AI and how/if they’re using it is a good way to begin. Depending on the size of the organization, this can be done with every staff member individually or a representative group from each department. Generally people fall into three camps when it comes to AI: 1) Those who are already using AI on a regular basis; 2) those who are curious and have experimented a bit, but they don’t actively engage with AI tools; and 3) those who don’t see much value in AI. This last group can also include people who outright oppose AI, but they make themselves apparent pretty quickly. Data also shows there is often a significant percentage of staff who use AI in secret because they’re not sure they’re allowed to use it for work purposes. The second way to collect staff sentiment and AI capacity is with a blind online survey asking everyone what they like about AI, what concerns them, how they feel about job security, what they want to learn, what they hope to achieve, etc. Everything is anonymous so you can expect a wide variety of feedback ranging from constructive/optimistic to fears of an impending robot apocalypse. Once complete, all the data should be synthesized into key takeaways for leadership and shared with staff to show a high level of transparency right from the beginning of this process. The second part of this phase is developing an AI task force. The value of this cannot be overemphasized. Choose a small group of AI champions from various departments to do three things: Provide direction for stewarding the various processes in each phase as effectively as possible from beginning to end Share constructive and thoughtful input they’re hearing from other staff members about how things are proceeding well and where there are challenges Help scale AI adoption across teams by showing how they’re using AI effectively to everyone else in the organization An internal AI task force or council is invaluable because the members are motivated and they want to learn. Mostly, their enthusiasm and success with AI will begin to rub off on many of their colleagues and inspire self-learning and greater adoption among the teams. But not all. There will be those who disengage, and there can be a significant number of them. Over time, they should be consulted to understand their trepidation, which should then be addressed. This is a challenge I'm having with one organization where a significant cohort are saying they're too busy to learn AI. Meanwhile, the majority of the staff are reporting daily usage with effective results, which definitely wasn't the case a few months ago. And even with those leaning in, the level of improvement and AI Iearning will be slow at times. This is why it’s critical for the CEO and the rest of management to be all-in and consistently participate in staff training sessions to show direction, intention and support. It’s very easy for the novelty of AI training to wear off after the first few months. This is where the AI task force can be instrumental to help maintain overall staff interest and keep engagement levels as high as possible. "Finally, we have some direction." — Kate Yordi, director of marketing, Visit Mesa Phase 3: AI Policy & Investments Developing an official AI policy and governance manual accomplishes two primary objectives: It protects the organization against legal and financial liability by establishing how all employees are required to use AI responsibly. It encourages and gives license for staff to proactively experiment with AI because there are clear guidelines in place about how to do so. There are many DMOs who have created AI policies and are willing to share with the rest of the industry. These are typically not lengthy documents (3-4 pages) nor full of legalese. Generally they’re written so every single employee can understand everything in them. Sections in these policies often include: Positioning/Purpose Statement: Expresses how and why the organization needs to be intentional about implementing AI processes Primary Objectives and Intended Outcomes: Defines the business case for how the organization is attempting to deliver on its core mandate of driving revenue to local businesses in alignment with community priorities Guiding Principles: Establishes the principles of responsible AI use in alignment with the values of the organizations related to themes such as inclusivity, bias, authenticity, veracity, collaboration, knowledge sharing, etc. AI Definitions: Provides clear explanations of AI terminology used in the document and workplace AI Tools: Identifies specific AI models that the organization provides access to Data Input: Dictates clear rules about what employees can upload into AI models and what they can’t upload, such as personal information of any person Monitoring: Defines how the organization reserves the right to monitor AI practices Training & Support: Defines opportunities for professional growth and learning AI on an ongoing basis There are other items that DMOs might include in the above list, and they vary depending on how HR, financial and legal departments interpret AI governance, but it serves as a foundation. One key consideration for DMO leadership when it comes to policy is identifying which pro AI models to invest in. Paid AI tools provide higher levels of privacy and security because AI companies don’t train on them, or at least there’s the choice to select that option. Many DMOs, for example, purchase annual subscriptions for paid ChatGPT Team accounts ($25 per employee monthly) for staff to use for work, which is a first step for protecting the IP and other interests of the organization. Other paid AI models are then provided to specific departments based on need and the specific attributes of the tools, such as Claude for marketing and social media staff because many consider it the best AI for content creation. Phase 4: AI Education & Implementation This is the most important thing in training teams to embrace and use AI effectively. You want to foster an environment where structured learning evolves into self-learning. That’s the only way this scales. When staff members with little experience in AI start exploring how to use AI on their own, and they start helping their colleagues see new ways to use AI, that’s a pretty special thing. From an education standpoint, the DMO AI Roadmap begins at a high level defining AI’s place in online history. AI is the third transformational shift since the PC was invented, including: The mainstream web/internet in the 1990s; the evolution of mobile/social/cloud and apps in the 2000s; and gen AI in the 2020s. These are the only three times when big tech went all-in and pivoted their business models around a new technology. I then break AI training into the following buckets, and again, this is all very surface level and not meant to be comprehensive. Also, creating engaging demos are everything, and that's not also easy because AI demos can be a real slog sometimes. But, showing how different AIs provide real value is key for people to internalize their learning and use it more intuitively over time: Explain how pre-gen AI tech is deterministic and gen AI is probabilistic, which messes with a lot of people’s minds. Gen AI outputs are based on statistical patterns and probabilities, just like the human brain processes ideas and information. Traditional tech is based on absolutes, delivering the same output based on the same input. Old tech is about information. AI is about knowledge. Spend a lot of time on this with workshops and demos. Highlight the capabilities of only three AI models to start: ChatGPT for brainstorming and planning; Claude for writing and data analysis; and Perplexity for conversational search. The other two, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, are more general purpose. They also do amazing things (Gemini 2.5 Pro is great for reasoning), but focusing on the first three will provide direction at the beginning so people don’t get overwhelmed. At the very minimum, leadership should have a basic understanding of those three. Explain how AI search isn't 100% perfect but it's a 1,000% better than old search. Define how DMOs and all brnads are redesigning their websites and content strategy to optimize for AI search, and the basics of AI SEO . I would argue the most important thing for using AI is really understanding how generative AI = conversational AI. It's a dialogue. It's called "chat" for a reason. This is where I’ve heard the most positive feedback from teams I’ve worked with. It happens when people move beyond the Google mindset—where search is one and done—and they see the real value of iterative conversations with AI models that evolve with each exchange in the discussion, just like a human conversation. This also removes some misperceptions about how to prompt. Yes, there are some basic rules about how to prompt well. But beyond that, it’s vastly more beneficial to explore AI conversations further with thoughtful follow-up prompts that flow logically and organically to achieve the best results. Explore how the real value of AI extends beyond just efficiency and productivity gains. That's a dangerous dialogue with staff who can construe that as leading to more work or being terminated over time. The bigger value and better narrative is how AI increases creativity and knowledge, and how those both influence overall quality of work, marketing effectiveness, sales productivity, staff culture and pride, job satisfaction and growth opportunities, etc. Really dig into the advanced features of the paid models: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro. Aside from the added security and privacy they provide, they offer functions not available in the free models and their outputs are significantly better. ChatGPT Projects and custom GPTs, Claude Projects and Perplexity Spaces are where the magic happens. Create an environment where staff members are eager to share their successes with AI with the rest of the organization. This feedback loop is critical for steering education and driving adoption, and it’s one of the most important roles for the internal AI task force. AI-training meetings can be highly effective during video calls but they often have the greatest impact during in-person workshops. Also, make sure to give staff a specific amount of hours during the week to develop their AI skills. Explore options for AI chat platforms and the benefits they provide for visitors and local industry partners. I work with Matador Network, which developed the industry leading GuideGeek AI chat platform. The feedback from 35+ DMO clients is impressive and irrefutable, but there is still much work to do educating visitors and industry about AI chat strategy and their benefits to continually increase adoption and business outcomes. The DMO AI Roadmap also provides guidance for developing various learning and engagement formats: Schedule weekly or bi-weekly meetings specifically, and only, for AI training with both internal and external people sharing insights Create a library of AI educational materials for staff to reference Start a weekly internal AI newsletter to share how teams are using AI Start a Slack or similar channel dedicated for AI education, AI news updates, knowledge sharing, etc Start a weekly and optional one-hour AMA meeting for everyone to ask everyone else questions (highly effective) Create a regular schedule for staff to report back to leadership or department heads about how they’re using AI and what they’re achieving with it Phase 5: Success Tracking I kick off every AI presentation identifying the three AI models mentioned above—ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity—followed by the assertion that, "AI is the death of 'I don't know.'" That is arguably the biggest ROI for integrating AI in a DMO or any other type of organization. There are few questions that are too complex or too intimidating for DMO staff to approach with confidence and conviction if they know how to use those three AI models effectively. I shared an example previously where I used Perplexity Pro to educate myself about how board governance is evolving . That for me was something I knew was out of my realm of expertise, but now I feel I can speak with some semblance of authority about that to any board because of AI. Before gen AI, I dismissed board governance as one of those things I'd just have to leave in the dark. That said, trying to explain how AI helps staff become more self-reliant, where they can always build a foundation of understanding for anything to empower themselves, only goes so far with a board. They're looking for more quantitative KPIs. Here are just some examples of that in a DMO context. In 2025, defining KPIs for AI integration is an evolving science, and we as an industry are still figuring a lot of this out. Therefore, this list is nowhere near comprehensive and it will evolve, but we have ample data today to validate the following: Using AI for search and content development saves significant time and increases opportunities for higher output and increased creativity for producing blog posts, social media, videos, marketing campaigns, etc. Developing custom GPTs (in ChatGPT Plus) for group sales is a proven strategy for creating better, more customized proposals in much less time. That gives sales staff more time for brainstorming and prospecting leading to higher production. That's a fact. In this case, group sales people are actually pumped to try a new technology. Using AI for regression analysis and scenario modeling increases the accuracy of how DMOs predict visitor volumes year-round, event attendance, economic impact, etc. One of the biggest conversations in DMOs today is how to develop content and websites to rank higher in AI search. Developing best practices in AI SEO leads to higher traffic. That is a core mandate for any DMO, and no DMO can afford to ignore that over time. AI chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI are driving real business. As described in PhocusWire in March, New York City Tourism + Conventions launched its GuideGeek-powered "Ellis" meeting-specific AI chat in January. ROI to date: 100% increase in traffic to the meeting planner website, 800+ AI-driven queries in the first month, 50% growth in newsletter sign-ups, and 10% increase in time spent on the site. Summary The AI train has left the station and it's gaining steam. The DMO AI Roadmap is the next logical step for helping DMO CEOs and their teams integrate AI processes and platforms. As Visit Mesa's Kate Yordi said, "Finally, we now have direction." That's a big deal for DMO staff to feel that way. Generative AI has been with us for more than two years now, but a structured and phased approach for integrating AI across DMO departments has been the missing piece. Visit Mesa's DMO AI Roadmap is going to evolve as the team works through the process, but at least now there's a vision and scope. Visit Mesa CEO Marc Garcia and the board are fully committed—a critical first step for embarking on this journey. Also, this strategic framework for how DMOs approach AI is going to underpin the interactive AI Playground activation at U.S. Travel's upcoming ESTO conference in Phoenix, August 17-19. U.S. Travel and GuideGeek are partnering to develop educational programming for the hands-on AI training experience and series of thought leadership. Greg Oates

How AI Improves DMO and Community Master Planning Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Many DMOs are developing 10-year destination master plans to optimize their visitor economy in alignment with local community priorities. I've participated in producing dozens of them from Miami to Mesa. They often take as long as a year to complete because there's so much focus on community engagement in various formats: interviews, focus groups, town halls, surveys, visioning sessions, etc. The tourism industry talks about the importance of community a LOT. However, when you're working with a DMO, you never really dig into what actually moves the needle across so many endless community demands, not on a tactical and hyperlocal level. You're not really held accountable for any measure of success when it comes to community-specific initiatives, ranging from improving City Hall permitting processes for small businesses to tracking the movement of unhoused. A master plan needs to address those and amplify those kinds of pressing needs for the destination overall. The expectation is not really to fix them. That’s not the role of a DMO. It's a whole different ballgame when you're developing a long-term strategic framework for a community organization like Near Southside, Inc . in Fort Worth. Success and being accountable for fixing things is expected. Located at the periphery of the downtown core, Near Southside is the most interesting community in North America right now. The ex-industrial district can be loosely compared to Austin 20 years ago with the same cultural DNA and similar community values, based on a fiercely protective love for local, creative and independently owned small businesses. That's under threat. In the last few years, as Near Southside evolved into the coolest 'hood east and west of the Pecos Line, real estate prices are rising commensurately. We all know how this story often ends with the encroachment of national brands sanitizing the soul of a place that made it attractive in the first place. Near Southside is intent on rewriting that story. AI Processes for Strategic Planning Here's where AI comes in. Because of the multitude of overlapping challenges and evolving dynamics in the community, our team needs to crunch and debate a ton of qualitative and quantitative data. Addressing gentrification touches on so many aspects of how communities operate. Therefore, we are over-indexing on community engagement to get as many perspectives as possible to identify how the community best evolves in the face of rapid change. The amount of inputs we're getting is substantive, and we want to inventory all of it as thoroughly as possible to build a super comprehensive knowledge base for the AI to cull through, connect dots and output insights. Every individual zoom call with stakeholders is recorded with Granola AI, which produces full transcripts but the summaries are too light. So we created custom GPTs with instructions for everything we want in the summaries, including comprehensive overviews, key takeaways with detailed context for each, the most insightful quotes related to those takeaways, and all action items that stakeholders recommended. With the GPT, we can fire full transcripts into the chat, press "enter" and receive highly valuable, high quality and uniform summaries almost immediately. We're doing the same with the focus groups but the custom GPTs require a different set of instructions. The two-hour transcripts capture the conversations with 10-20 stakeholders convened across specific industry and community segments. For those, the GPTs bucket corresponding high-level takeaways and tactical action items related to the same theme. That has immeasurable value because these conversations are all over the place. It's great working with locals who are so passionate about where they live and how, but that means you're getting feedback from a firehose and someone taking notes doesn’t capture all the nuance. Using custom GPTs to produce these summaries and populate takeaways is as good or better than any team could do manually. Everything is stored in Airtable. Forget Google or Microsoft cloud platforms. Airtable is an AI-powered, relational database/spreadsheet beast for organizing data and automating basic workflows. The tables combine all project information in one place, such as a running list of pending/completed interviews and focus groups and their AI-generated summaries. Airtable can then auto-generate a summary of the summary in the same table for clients to easily review everything being collected on a daily basis to whatever degree they prefer. Once you use Airtable, you'll never look at Google Drive the same way again. I've never had so many insights so well organized, so thorough and so easy to share with a team and client to help inform each project phase. The client loves the transparency, immediacy and structure, naturally, versus waiting for the next weekly update to read a few bullet points in a PowerPoint. Here's the thing. Because we've been so intentional about collecting such a high quality and comprehensive volume of feedback, we have a motherlode of a knowledge base for AI to work with. We can then enter all that in bulk into Google NotebookLM or ChatGPT/Claude Projects to pull out anything from high-level aggregate takeaways to anything super customized or tactical. For example, the client was interested in hearing specifically just what developers had to say about gentrification. I wanted highlights related to anything discussed regarding City Hall processes. It’s super easy to pull reports together for those and anything else. Ultimately, you can use AI to deliver an outline, a strategy map and a very rough draft of a destination master plan. All you need to do is combine all of the above together, plus PDFs of all relevant public and private planning documents, PDFs of all relevant case studies and best practices, and detailed instructions about the purpose, elements, structure, etc., of the plan. People will disagree, sure. I'm not dismissing the expertise of people who put these things together, because they bring deep context to every conversation and decision made during the development of a master plan. Everything happening now in Near Southside has happened somewhere else. When you can bring takeaways from those places to any present situation, it helps provide direction for everyone in the room. Again, I’m not saying that AI is replacing humans. People get all kinds of worked up over that, especially in travel and tourism. I am saying you can create a better, more strategic and more informed master plan in a much more streamlined fashion when you employ AI strategically to better prepare a community for the future. That's just a fact. I have four more community focus groups today in Near Southside. The expectation among everyone is that their contributions will make a demonstrable difference in their neighborhood. We can’t just speak to the challenges. We need to fix them and our processes with AI are giving everyone more confidence that we can deliver on that. Wondering how many DMOs are interested in employing similar AI-first strategies to get a better handle on how to help their communities. Greg Oates

How Visit Richmond is Using AI to Sell More Conventions Aug 2 Written By Greg Oates DMO CEOs want specific use cases for AI showing how they drive measurable business results. Here's a great example for capitalizing on AI to drive meetings and conventions volume from Lauran Peoples , director of sales marketing and business development at Visit Richmond in Virginia. Peoples works in the organization's 13-person sales team and reports to the VP of sales. Her role has three core functions: She is the main liaison between the destination sales and marketing departments; she develops and leads campaign strategy for the sales department; and she works with her colleagues to optimize strategic partnerships. Peoples' role is somewhat unique as a liaison between sales and marketing in that she lives on the sales side, versus marketing. She also stands out in our industry as an emerging voice in AI innovation. If you're going to U.S. Travel's ESTO conference this month in Phoenix, look for her and me working in the show's inaugural AI Playground educational activation. Greg Oates: Can you explain your role at Visit Richmond, specifically in terms of how you bridge the sales and marketing teams? Lauran Peoples: It's becoming more common in DMOs for sales teams to have a marketing liaison, but usually that person is based on the marketing team and is mostly assigned to sales to help with creative. The issue is when that marketing liaison is based on the marketing team, they don't have much exposure to the field and what's happening out of market with your salespeople. Our sales team has 45 trade shows this upcoming fiscal year, so they're traveling almost every week. With my situation in Richmond, they're getting real-time data and downloads about what's happening in each destination, so that gives them more authentic conversations to engage planners. Not having someone assigned to a team like that creates a huge disconnect and leaves opportunity on the table. GO: Tell us a little about your journey with AI. LP: I've been working in hospitality for 20 years. Last year, I heard some younger people on the team talking about ChatGPT. So I was like, okay, I don't know anything about that. I went to PCMA Convening Leaders in January and the opening session was all about AI. I remember sitting there feeling like a dinosaur. Feeling very behind. I realized this is a lot more serious and widespread than I thought, so I left and tasked myself with using ChatGPT once a day. Initially, I couldn't differentiate how it wasn't like Google. I was asking it how many tablespoons are in this or that, kind of thing. Since then, my understanding of AI has progressively increased around more complex and comprehensive capabilities. It has streamlined my productivity, but more importantly, AI has become a thought partner for me to bounce all these ideas and scenarios around that I didn't have before. I think that a lot of people are adopting AI and using it as a communications assistant, or a writing assistant. But the part for me that's really exciting and valuable with AI is analyzing and aggregating data and getting it to show you things that you need help with, like sales. GO: Can you share an example? LP: Sure. I took five datasets: five years of lost business, five years of definite business, and three marketing reports from different campaigns we were running with outside agencies like Sojourn and Digital Edge. Those campaigns give us demographic insights because we were targeting certain areas. I also grabbed our sales deployment sheet, which tells you who has what market. I uploaded all of those into ChatGPT and asked it to identify the top five locations for each of our managers based on their market segments. Some results weren't surprising, but there were a few that popped up like Orlando that we've never traditionally considered. When I asked ChatGPT why Orlando, it showed how the city has a large hobby market. It turns out there are a lot of hobby conventions that meet in Orlando. After I compiled the top five locations for each manager, I asked ChatGPT to give me the top five accounts in each of those locations. Then I asked for unique selling propositions for each of those accounts as to why Richmond would be a perfect fit. Finally, I asked it to rank those five destinations based on probability of success. GO: Have you seen any of this result in new business opportunities? LP: Yes. One location that showed up was Philadelphia. Richmond is four hours from Philadelphia, but like Orlando it hasn't typically been on our radar. However, based on the data from ChatGPT, Philly came up as a recommendation. So we sent one of our sales managers to Philadelphia, and she ended up hosting 18 planners, including some who drove from over an hour away to see her. She got such a great response that I had to jump in and go with her because she couldn't host 18 clients by herself. AI has now informed our sales strategy for Philly, and the region is now part of our dedicated sales strategy. We've allocated funds for that sales manager in Philly to join chapters of organizations like MPI and PCMA. So that's how we know there had to be some accuracy to our approach with AI. GO: How do the sales managers feel about you doing this AI analysis? LP: They appreciate it. It's a balance because most sales managers at DMOs aren't entry level; they've been in hospitality for a long time. This is a new process and a new tool for them. Some have destinations they like to go to over and over because they're successful there. But my role is to support business enablement and sales enablement to help them do what they do better and uncover new business. So how we're using AI provides them with additional actionable research. GO: I think one of the most underrated strategies for AI is developing custom GPTs in ChatGPT to help sales teams develop more customized and effective proposals more quickly. Are you building those at all? LP: Yes, definitely. About a month and a half ago, I programmed a GPT for the sales team called "Prospecting Partner." It's trained on our sales collateral and all our information, so it knows our convention packages and understands our jurisdiction and seven localities. The sales managers have been using it to prospect smarter. I included suggested prompts to go beyond just, "Give me a prospecting email." We can get really specific, like, "Help me re-engage an association planner who just lost grant funding." It also provides strategies specifically related to that, and then you can ask how to execute those strategies. So, for example, we know from reports that finance and insurance is an opportunity market for us. It's a small percentage of our current business but it has the highest average daily rate, which makes it very attractive to our hotel partners. So our salespeople are asking ChatGPT for ways we can develop business in the finance and insurance market, and really dig into that. Ultimately, AI is helping our sales team think bigger, smarter and more strategically. I've asked the sales team if they found this helpful, and, you know, salespeople are not an easy crowd. They said yes across the board. With the ChatGPT Enterprise version, I can't see their exact prompts due to privacy, but I can see the number of conversations they're having with the tool, so I know they're actively using it. GO: How are other people on your team using AI? LP: My two direct reports are our CRM database administrator and our sales coordinator. My sales coordinator does support work for the entire team, so she's using ChatGPT a lot for ideation, like when a sales manager needs an itinerary to entertain clients in Chicago. My CRM database administrator uses ChatGPT as a communication assistant because sometimes analytical personality types can benefit from exploring more communication nuances. She's also started incorporating it into data cleanup, using it to analyze reports and suggest what's missing or what would be beneficial. She uses it to help fill in gaps and identify what's not being asked or said. GO: What are some of your future plans with AI? LP: We're launching microsites for destination sales and sports, and I think it will set a model for the rest of the organization because we’re replacing our website from pre- to post-AI, like most DMO sites these days. We're currently writing copy for the microsites, and I've been getting into structured data and semantic clarity. You don't search ChatGPT or prompt ChatGPT with the same language you search Google, so content has to be written differently. Previously, you'd go to Google and say "restaurants near me." Now with ChatGPT, it's more of a conversation, so you'll say, "Hey, I'm in Scott's Addition historic district in Richmond with my kids, and we're looking for a vegan restaurant." That semantic clarity allows AI to respond with much more specific answers. I think we need to anticipate AI searches, as opposed to Google searches, in how we write content. Everyone is subconsciously expecting a personally curated experience today. When I go on Amazon, I'm expecting it to make connections that I like this, so I might also like this, without me having to tell it certain things. That's where we have to move towards, or we get eclipsed or become obsolete, especially if we're just thinking of ourselves as brokers for a destination. Greg Oates

Visit Phoenix CEO on Leading AI Strategy and Being Chill About It Jul 28 Written By Greg Oates I learned a lot about how DMO leaders can confidently integrate AI processes into their organizations after speaking with Ron Price, CDME, president and CEO of Visit Phoenix. Price is somewhat new to AI but his staff have been doing cool things with various LLMs for a while. He says his primary role with AI is providing the Visit Phoenix team with an enabling environment for success built on a culture of trust. Price accomplishes that by inspiring everyone to experiment with AI, be aware of the liabilities, share their wins, have fun with it, reach out to others for advice, and most of all, validate everything. Although, what stood out for me the most talking with Price is his calm and clear approach to AI, basically inferring (in my words, not his)... "We got this. We might do something amazing today with AI or we might not, but either way we're fully committed to seeing what it can do. We're also going to figure this AI thing out by collaborating with our many DMO industry friends. Because AI is going to change everything in a hurry, and we at Visit Phoenix are not going to be caught staring out at a Sonoran sunset while the world passes our city by." That's the vibe I got. That's leadership. That's what being a CEO means, at least for me. AI is confusing, sure, and CEOs have to worry about their boards and electeds. The thing is, we're more than two and a half years into generative AI now, and it's not going to wait for CEOs to decide if they can "trust AI" or not. I think we can all learn from Price a few things: We can de-escalate all the hubris and hand-wringing surrounding AI by being open to possibilities and having a clear set of principles, especially related to responsible AI use and verification. You can have fun with AI and focus on business outcomes at the same time. The DMO industry needs to collaborate and share best practices more intentionally to accelerate AI education, innovation and integration. We must encourage DMO staff to use AI today so they can steer the future of our industry tomorrow. Price likes talking about AI. I would encourage any DMO CEOs on the fence with AI to reach out to him. Greg Oates: Ron, how do you use AI? Ron Price: I use AI every single day, going back now about a month and a half. I'm just fascinated and interested in what it's able to do. I wouldn't say I'm an early adopter, of course, although there are some people who aren't even on it yet. Me personally, I use it for everything, like if I'm curious about something that's happening within the region. Or maybe I want to quickly compile a lot of data to help solve a problem or answer questions as I get ready for different meetings. More or less, my brain is always just firing, like, "What if we tried this or that?" And so, this year has been a cool realization about what AI can do, and seeing how it's pulling all the sources through to validate what it responds with. We have also integrated AI with Microsoft Copilot. We pay for everyone to have access to that, and then we also have a ChatGPT Team account for our staff. GO: Where else are you seeing value with AI at Visit Phoenix? RP: In our world, it's marketing, it's content. I love being surrounded by people who can write really well. It's an art to me, and I don't possess that art. It's like someone playing the piano. I'm in awe of that. So AI gives people the ability to write better, and it's okay to lean into it. Don't feel threatened by it. AI is able to give you that one golden nugget, or it suggests that one good idea that can really help someone when they're writing. Here's the fun part. Every day, we're learning something unique. We have the Cronkite School of Journalism in Phoenix, and some of the students are here. We kind of give them free rein, and we're also teaching them at the same time. The way that they use AI is amazing. It's fun to walk down the hall to see them because I'm always like, "How did you write that? How did you create that image? How did you pull that data and research together?" It's just a different generation. We're also seeing where our people are asking AI things like, "If I'm a salesperson, how do I influence a group to come here in the middle of the summer for a conference? Why is it fun to be here for a conference when it's 110 degrees out?" And what does AI have to say? Well, one thing that's great about, say, Grok, for example, it's pulling from all these little texts on Twitter, or X. They're from people saying, "Hey, I know it's summertime in Phoenix but look what I got to do." Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use. GO: Does your staff using AI increase your organization's impact in the community? RP: We not only focus on growing tourism in our community, but we're also joined at the hip with economic development. We look at our role as we're here to build a better community through tourism. And so, when you think about utilizing all the data out there, we always ask ourselves, "How could AI help us consolidate that data and crunch the numbers faster to give us a clearer picture of what we think we know?" For example, how much business that comes in through our leads touch our priority sectors? And of those sectors, which ones align extremely well with what we're doing here at Visit Phoenix? Is it semiconductors? Is it bio-med? Is it something that leans into the engineering side because of what ASU and the Department of Defense are doing? We've seen we can go back and look at the data and get a better picture of those things now. Also, as an example, we have a high propensity to book business around the semiconductor space. So we're utilizing these AI tools to quickly do research like, "Give me a list of the top semiconductor conferences that take place around the world." The responses are quicker and the results are better versus doing a traditional Google search. It's able to pull from a lot of different sources, so that's another way we're using AI. “Overall, AI is just a fun environment to play in. We're not going to use everything. It's just another tool that we get to use.” GO: How do you define the role of a CEO to guide a DMO forward with AI? RP: Setting up the rules of the game is important. There are areas of liability we have to be aware of about what you can and can't be pulling in. Those are the types of things we needed to figure out, you know, basically, "What is our rule book for using AI?" I like giving people the ability to use AI as they will. I think it works best whenever people know that it's a tool we want them to utilize. And if it can help us at the end of the day tell a better story, be smarter as we go after business, and be smarter with our analytics to help build our marketing strategy stronger, then use it. I try to build a team of leaders so they're CEOs of their own divisions, and I want them to be thought leaders in their areas. Also, I think AI enables us to get to answers quickly, but, and this is important, how do we validate those answers? We're really good at Visit Phoenix when it comes to validating answers, but we're usually doing it by going the long way and understanding how AI responded like it did. We're reading source by source by source, and then we kind of come to our own conclusion. It's like we're not just focused on the punch line of a joke. We can also tell you the structure of the joke. You always have to validate. We get excited about using AI because it just puts us in a new position. I think it's good to have a CEO that supports that, but that support comes from a trust within the organization. I trust that people are going to utilize AI to help make us better. GO: What keeps you up at night regarding AI? RP: My fear is how do we control and ensure that someone isn't producing something negative on our behalf, and then launching it to the world, and using this incredible tool to hurt us? Because there are people that are extremely gullible who believe whatever they're looking at. That's kind of where my brain goes sometimes. It's only because of what I've already seen these tools can do. I think across the DMO industry, we'll have some "ahas," especially when we get together in various forums to exchange ideas. We need to be talking with each other about, "Here are some things that work really well with AI, and here are the headwinds." And then, "These are the things you need to realize could happen with AI, and here are some ways you can mitigate those problems." The more we can learn from others about how they're using AI, the better. I think what you're putting together about AI strategy with all your insights is going to be extremely valuable. GO: Thank you. So, what are you thinking about next with AI? RP: As AI continues to grow, and we've talked about it here internally, what is the value of a website? In fact, we just started our next fiscal year, July 1. Website visits is no longer a key metric that we're going after. As a leader, I like knowing what's three steps ahead. We currently have these tools, but how are they going to change the way we make decisions going forward? At some point, a lot of what we're talking about now is going to be white noise. And what then? It doesn't mean our jobs of promoting a destination change. It means we're going to get so much better at telling our story through so many different avenues. I believe that our reach is actually going to broaden. We're still going to be responsible for promoting our destination and selling our destination, but how we tell the story and how we show the story is going to change as these tools evolve. Back in the day, a lot of us were reading about Moore's Law and how things just keep improving and getting cheaper, especially in technology. Now we're moving into a space where the rate of growth with AI is going to be something we've never seen before. Greg Oates

German Convention Bureau Leader on the Future of AI-Powered Meetings Jul 27 Written By Greg Oates After the global financial crisis ended in 2011, a few cities and nations around the world began promoting themselves to meeting and convention organizers based on their intellectual capital, versus venues and attractions. Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau (GCB), led this strategy in Europe at the time. Around the same year, I was visiting the House of Logistics & Mobility (HOLM) think tank in Frankfurt. The GCB suggested I visit there to better understand this new direction for attracting high-value business events in advanced industries. "The city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," Dr. Stefan Walter told me, who was a professor at HOLM at the time. "So, this [GCB] strategy is about finding the strengths of our strengths, our core competencies, and for Germany, that’s knowledge and infrastructure. It’s also about connecting ideas.” That has been my due north working in the travel industry ever since. This idea that meeting planners and attendees can tap into a deep knowledge base in a host destination, specific to their interests, for me, is intoxicating. The challenge is it takes a ton of work connecting local leaders in specific advanced industries, like aviation in Frankfurt or e-mobility in Stuttgart, with large global organizations in those same industries and convince them to bring their big annual event to Germany. It's also pretty high level. From an attendee standpoint, if I'm in Hamburg and want to learn about HafenCity, the largest urban makeover in Europe, it's not like I can easily access a bunch of people and organizations leading the future of urban development. Which, would be cool, right? AI is helping make that a reality. Germany's national Open Data/Knowledge Graph project is an ambitious AI-powered initiative to build a massive network of industry suppliers, academic organizations and business leaders across the country. Basically, by indexing the visitor industry and intellectual capital supply chain, Germany can connect the brightest minds in Germany with the rest of the world more seamlessly, effectively and equitably. An "interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine," if you will. I spoke with Mr. Schultze to learn more about how AI is impacting the meetings and convention industry in Germany. Greg Oates: How is AI evolving across Germany's visitor industry? Specifically, how are your municipal CVBs and other partners thinking about and using AI right now? Matthias Schultze: Like much of the world, things really accelerated for us around two years ago with the rise of tools like ChatGPT. Suddenly, everyone, from corporates to associations, started thinking seriously about AI. We saw an opportunity and created an innovation platform called ebx.lab . It’s a peer-to-peer learning community for event planners, where we partner with scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute to explore how AI might reshape the business events space. From those early sessions, we have published a few white papers and identified a few core insights. AI clearly has potential to personalize experiences, optimize event planning processes, improve engagement and networking, and maybe most exciting, support predictive analytics. That last one, especially, being able to anticipate trends or behaviors based on data, is what feels most transformative to me personally. GO: How is the GCB embracing AI internally? MS: We developed our own internal AI strategy for the German Convention Bureau. We wanted to give both our team and our stakeholders a shared framework, something that outlined where we are today, where we want to go, and how we get there. It’s called "Driven by People, Powered by Data," and that title really reflects our belief that AI is a tool, not a solution in itself. People need to lead the process. The strategy helps us clarify not just what we can do with AI, but also what we can’t or shouldn’t do, at least not yet. It outlines our roadmap and aligns everyone across our organization and membership. GO: Is that strategy available publicly? MS: Yes, though only in German for now. But with the right AI tools, you can translate it quickly. The strategy touches on everything from marketing and communications to event planning, workflow automation, customer personalization, sustainability, and even ethics and compliance. The ethics component is particularly important. As exciting as AI is, we have to keep guardrails in place. Within our organization, we’re working hard to ensure that AI isn’t something siloed or limited to leadership. It needs to be embedded across every level. Everyone in the organization is expected to develop basic AI literacy. We’ve also worked on minimum viable products for things like dashboards and customer-facing chatbots. Some are already in use today. GO: You've always been a strong and vocal proponent for sustainability in business events. How is AI supporting you there? MS: I’m very proud of a project we developed with 29 other European countries: the Sustainability Hub for Events . It’s an AI-driven platform that brings together all kinds of sustainability related data—certifications, guidelines, best practices—and makes them accessible through an interactive AI agent. Planners can ask things like, “Can you help me build a sustainable menu?” or input event details to estimate their CO₂ footprint. It’s highly practical, and it’s making a real difference for event planners who need fast, reliable and actionable sustainability information. GO: We've talked about your Open Data and Knowledge Graph project in Germany numerous times in the past. Is that now live? MS: It’s technically live but still in progress, and probably always will be, in a sense. We’re continuously expanding it. The Open Data Germany project by the German National Tourist Board is live with its Knowledge Graph. The Open Data MICE project, which is implemented in close cooperation with the GNTB, is not yet live. One exciting element launching soon is an interactive map of research institutions in Germany. It will show where key research and innovation is taking place, including medical tech, renewable energy and so on, and link that data to infrastructure like hotels and conference venues. The idea is to visualize Germany as a knowledge landscape. If you’re planning an event and you want to anchor it around a theme like urban mobility, the map will show you which regions are most active in that field and match you with the relevant venues and experts. GO: One theme I keep obsessing about, and it's felt like a bit of a fantasy for more than a decade, is that the city of the future is an interdisciplinary knowledge sharing machine. That idea is a direct quote from your House of Logistics and Mobility in Frankfurt, and it’s stuck with me ever since I heard it back in 2011. It's this idea of a city as a platform. Do you think we're getting closer to executing on this idea, where innovation at all levels is more accessible and shareable for more people? Ultimately what we're talking about here is the democratization of knowledge and excellence. MS: I love that idea. I really do. I think there are two layers to it. On one level, we have the smart city movement with systems that integrate transportation, energy, data and infrastructure to make better decisions. That’s already happening in many places across Europe. But on a deeper level, regarding your fantasy.... Let's say you could land in Munich, be interested in urban tech, and immediately connect with people, events and institutions aligned with that interest—that’s becoming possible too. The data already exists. It’s just scattered. But with open data standards, machine readability, and the right AI tools, we can start connecting those dots. Your fantasy city may not be so far off.

A CEO's Playbook for AI Integration Oct 10 Written By Greg Oates Your competitors are talking about AI. Your board is asking about AI. Your partners want to see your AI strategy. Many DMOs are debating the potential of AI, while an increasing number of others are already extracting real business and organizational value. The difference isn't budget or technical talent. It's knowing exactly where to look for opportunities and how to scale what works. 3 Non-Negotiables You Must Lead This, Not Delegate It: AI transformation dies in committee. The organizations seeing real results have CEOs who champion specific initiatives, remove bureaucratic friction, and signal that AI adoption is a strategic priority. This doesn't mean micromanaging prompts. It means creating air cover for teams to experiment and fail fast. Complex Impresses, Simple Delivers: Your instinct will be to pursue the flashy, sophisticated AI applications that sound impressive in board presentations. Resist it. The organizations generating real ROI start with mundane problems: expense report processing, meeting summarization, competitive monitoring, etc. These boring use cases build organizational confidence and create the foundation for more ambitious projects. Your People Know Where the Problems Are: The best AI applications emerge from the intersection of daily frustration and technological possibility. Run hackathons. Create cross-functional workshops. Ask your teams what they do that feels like waste. The solutions they surface will be more practical and impactful than anything your consultants recommend. Start Here Stop looking for AI opportunities everywhere. Focus your organization's attention on three specific areas where AI creates immediate, measurable value. The Tedium Tax: Every role in your organization includes mind-numbing tasks that consume time without creating value: data entry, compliance documentation, procurement reports, staff vacation tracking, etc. Think of these as your "Anti To-Do List." These are tasks systematically eliminated by asking, "How can I never have to do this again?" Your teams are paying a tedium tax every day. AI is the refund. The Expertise Bottleneck: Projects stall when teams hit the limits of their skills and wait for other departments. Marketing needs data analysis and campaign design mockups. Finance and HR need custom GPTs. Sales needs meetings-related technical specifications translated into customer language. AI breaks these bottlenecks by giving every team superpowers they never had before. The Blank Page Problem: Knowledge work involves ambiguous challenges where the path forward isn't clear: Strategy development, market analysis, problem diagnosis, etc. AI excels at generating multiple approaches, analyzing incomplete information, and proposing next steps when your teams are stuck. It's the thinking partner that's always available and never runs out of ideas. 6 Use Cases OpenAI's analysis of 600+ successful implementations across various industries reveals that virtually every valuable AI application falls into one of six categories. Show your teams these six use cases and they'll start finding opportunities everywhere. Content Creation: Use AI for first drafts of everything: strategy documents, marketing campaigns, product and experience descriptions, customer and community communications. AI maintains your brand voice while eliminating the blank page problem. Research and Synthesis: AI powers information gathering at superhuman speed, including market analysis, competitive intelligence, customer feedback synthesis, regulatory research, etc.. AI doesn't just find information. It structures it exactly how you need it for decision-making. Coding for Everyone: Your non-technical teams can now write Python scripts, SQL queries, and data visualizations. Your engineering teams debug faster and prototype in unfamiliar languages. AI democratizes technical capability while accelerating your experts. Data Analysis Without Degrees: Upload spreadsheets, dashboard screenshots or raw data files and get structured analysis without requiring PhD-level statistics knowledge. This is arguably the most undervalued opportunity that delivers immediate results for most DMOs. Strategic Thinking Partner: AI is a beast for brainstorming, scenario planning, product and event development, asset mapping, risk analysis, etc. AI helps structure complex problems and identifies considerations your teams might miss. This is my favorite use case for AI. Intelligent Automation: Use platforms like n8n, Relay and others to create repeatable processes that run themselves, such as weekly competitive updates, financial reporting, sales and marketing workflows, a ton of admin duties, etc. Create the process once, then let AI handle the execution while humans focus on exceptions and strategy. Implementation is Where DMOs Fail Most AI initiatives fail because organizations treat them like traditional software deployments. They're not. AI is about change management and behavioral transformation up and down the org chart. AI implementation requires different approaches to discovery, prioritization and scaling. Systematic Opportunity Hunting: Don't wait for AI use cases to emerge organically. Run structured discovery sessions where teams audit their workflows for repetitive tasks, skill bottlenecks, and ambiguous challenges. Make this process ongoing, not a one-time exercise. The Impact-Effort Matrix: Not every AI opportunity deserves attention. Prioritize based on business impact versus implementation effort. Quick wins build momentum. High-value, high-effort projects become strategic investments. Everything else gets parked until technology makes it easier. Innovation as Culture: Internal competitions accelerate discovery while building AI literacy across your organization. The goal isn't technical sophistication. It's practical business solutions that teams actually want to use. Measure What Matters: Track time saved, accuracy improved, costs reduced and capability expansion. But also measure qualitative impacts: employee satisfaction, process improvements, competitive advantages. Use this data to guide scaling decisions. Build Your AI Process Move beyond random experimentation to systematic capability building. I like Estée Lauder's 5-phase process to ensure repeatable success with AI. Does this resonate with you for your DMO? Design: Define your purpose, scope and success criteria for AI integration in a 2-page brief. No scope creep. No technical complexity for its own sake. Prepare: Ask department heads to gather relevant data and best practices. AI tools should reflect organizational knowledge, not generic approaches. Build and Test: Hire contractors where necessary to help teams develop automations/agents, implement training, integrate datasets and validate accuracy. Focus on usability, not just functionality. Launch: Deploy with user guides and change management support. Technology deployment is easy. User adoption across all departments is a total headache at first. Optimize: Feedback loops drive continuous improvement based on actual usage patterns. AI applications evolve with business needs and improved capabilities. Key Insight: Always start with fundamental questions: Why build this? What problem does it solve? What impact will it have? Is the measurement for success quantitative or qualitative? Organizations that answer these questions clearly will build more successful AI applications than those focused primarily on technical capability. Build AI-Native Workflows The most sophisticated implementations integrate AI across entire business processes rather than individual tasks. This evolution positions organizations for the agentic AI capabilities coming next. Process Decomposition: Break complex workflows into constituent tasks, identify where each AI use case category adds value, and create integrated approaches spanning from research through execution. Marketing workflows might integrate research for market understanding, analysis for opportunity mapping, ideation for strategy, content creation for product and destination development, and automation for distribution. Cross-Functional Integration: AI facilitates better collaboration by translating between departments. Technical specifications become marketing language. Customer requirements inform sales priorities. Financial models drive strategic planning. Future-Proofing for Agents: Current workflow integration prepares your organization for AI agents that can complete entire projects independently. Teams that understand how to break processes into AI-addressable components will leverage these capabilities immediately when available. The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done. This cognitive shift creates advantages that compound over time and become increasingly difficult for competitors to replicate. "The organizations mastering workflow integration don't just use AI. They think differently about how work gets done." Key Takeaways The question isn't whether AI will transform our industry. It's whether you'll be leading that transformation or reacting to it. Start with clear, achievable use cases and systemic approaches to build the organizational muscle needed for transformation. AI advantage isn't about having the most technical teams or biggest budgets. It's about developing capabilities for organization-wide discovery, adoption, implementation and scaling of practical business solutions. The organizations moving beyond experimentation to systematic implementation today will be best positioned to leverage the more sophisticated AI capabilities emerging tomorrow. The agents are coming. Will you be ready? Greg Oates

The ROI of AI Agents Aug 21 Written By Greg Oates Based on a bunch of conversations at DI Annual 2025 this month, it's clear that many DMO executives still equate generative AI primarily with writing and editing in ChatGPT. But as one COO of a large U.S. DMO told me, "Surely there's more to all this than just learning about prompting." So many ways to respond to that. Meanwhile, there are also DMO leaders who established AI road maps for their organizations going back two years. For them, they're increasingly focused on developing AI-powered automated workflows and their more sophisticated cousins, AI agents. The purpose of these synthetic workflows is to automate tedious, time-consuming and repetitive tasks to free up staff to focus on more high-value work. Think of it as an evolution from using AI to building AI. You begin by visually mapping what people do in your organization. Then you identify where AI can potentially take over all the mundane stuff better and faster. I’ve been working with my colleagues at Matador Network to develop automated workflows for our Studio team. We have endless terabytes of client video created during the last 10 years. Now, with AI, we want to capitalize on those existing assets to create new video, but first we need to use AI to understand what we actually own. We contracted Erick Bonilla , founder of Pocho.tech based in Uruguay, to build a series of new AI workflows in n8n. One of the automations is designed to cull through 10 years of video files in Dropbox and catalogue everything in Airtable. The AI then creates standardized file names, project IDs, links for raw edited videos and finished client hero/cutdown videos, and location and content tags. The cost to develop the AI workflow was about $2,000 all-in, and it saved more than a month of work at a mid-level manager salary. The beauty of automations/agents is you can measure ROI annually fairly easily, which will help wake up your board if they're sleeping on AI. Moreover, once an automation is in place, the savings will continue to accrue in the future indefinitely for tasks still required, and there’s zero human error. During a staff Zoom, I asked members of our Studio team if they felt these new agents signaled to them the beginning of the end of some people’s jobs. The response was unanimous. Nobody wants to do this type of repetitive grunt work. I spoke with Bonilla for his take on the future of AI agents. Greg Oates: Erick, what services does Pocho.tech provide? Erick Bonilla: We identify opportunities within organizations of all sizes, where we believe implementing AI systems can dramatically improve the efficiency of operations. We can create workflows that process data, or we can create AI agents capable of reasoning, analyzing data, creating reports, and providing decision-makers with an enhanced way of digesting information. I have been doing this for almost two years, working with people mostly in the Middle East, the US and Latin America. The Pocha company site is brand new as I try to expand in the world of AI. GO: What’s the difference between automated workflows and agents? EB: A workflow is like a mass production factory. It's a set of operations that work through specific logic to automate a repetitive process that a human has done before. This could be writing and reading emails, writing summaries, reformatting and transferring content through different tools and applications, etc. An AI agent is a thinking environment that makes decisions for you. You can set a workflow for reading your emails. But then you can have an AI agent that summarizes your emails and tells you, if you have 10 emails, what those 10 emails are about in just one email, SMS text, WhatsApp message, Google doc or whatever. GO: So an AI agent has more autonomy and decision-making capabilities than an automated workflow? EB: Definitely. The AI agent is capable of being completely autonomous to make decisions within a given context. You give it a context with defined restrictions that narrows the scope of the decisions it can make. GO: Can you provide any success stories where you worked with a client who had a specific challenge, and you created an automated workflow or agent that successfully delivered a solution? EB: The most recent example is an EdTech company in Boston that provides a training and placement program for clean energy jobs. They've been operating for the past five years, but there’s been a lack of funds, employees and program applicants to scale beyond Massachusetts. So they decided to use AI and automation to build flows without having to invest a lot of money in hiring people. What I did was streamline the application process for people interested in entering the educational program. We created a form and a workflow that takes the information from the application and puts it into an application tracking system. This system has workflows that can trigger emails, daily reports, weekly reports and invitations to interview. Then I created an AI agent. Once the applicants are interviewed by a human, we take the transcript of that, analyze it using AI, and build a report for the decision maker so they can decide if this person is capable of entering the program or not. We also created a scoring system. We built it based on human criteria, which is subjective, and then we converted that into an objective dataset so we could classify people and score them based on numbers. All of this is done by an AI agent that sets a score for the applicant at the end of the interview. Then we have a leaderboard where people are ranked, and the top 15 get into the education program and placement process. GO: Were they happy with the end result? EB: Oh yeah, very happy. Here's where the beauty and magic come in. Now the CEO can envision a way of expanding outside Massachusetts, and tell her team, "Hey, we're going to New York!" Where before, she thought she needed to hire more people in each new state to oversee the operation. And, because an AI agent works 24/7, she doesn't have to wait until 8am to get a report or transcription, or anything anymore. So now, she can think about how to scale her company more successfully without having to hire more people. GO: What's the road map looking ahead? Where are you going with the company in terms of next steps? EB: We're trying to create an outreach system because the purpose of the company is not only to train people but also to place them in clean tech job positions. The outreach system is going to help the team find more companies with open positions, so the company can place more people in those positions. We’re building a system involving AI agents and workflows where we're going to take a picture of all the open positions and analyze and understand them using AI. We want to know, what are the requirements in terms of learning and knowledge capacity for people to get in these positions, so the company can build a better training program. GO: What was the biggest challenge working with them? EB: I think the most important one, and this is something anyone working on this will experience, is the resistance of some team members who don't trust the performance of AI enough. People who have low experience working with AI, and maybe only know ChatGPT, will look at this and say, "I don't believe this can work." So that means there’s a lot of educational work. People need enough knowledge about what AI tools are capable of to suggest what can and can’t work. I think that's the main challenge. But once people see it working, they start to lean into AI. Suddenly, they become like, "This is great. Can you add this other metric? Can you make it do this other thing too? Can you make me one for my personal side hustle?" It's interesting when you see people moving from resistance to acceptance. GO: Working with you has firmly cemented something I've been preoccupied with this year. It's this: One of the most exciting things about AI, which is giving us more time back during the day, requires the most boring thing, which is having uniform file and data structure. As we've discovered together only too well, AI can't reach its full potential unless you have everything structured super cleanly. The analogy I often use is that AI is like an 8-year-old savant. The person is brilliant but he or she often needs really consistent environments and clear guardrails, or things go sideways or just crash. Can you talk about what any organization needs to focus on when it comes to file and data structure? EB: I think one of the most basic things, and I'm living this with a company I'm helping right now, is documenting files and folders exactly the same. You must set protocols for everything when you’re building a folder system to store content and data. That's one of the biggest challenges for companies trying to implement AI automation with poorly standardized systems. When we didn’t have AI a few years ago, we didn't think of a machine reading our documents or files. We never thought that could be possible, so we never really focused on creating really good file structure. The biggest challenge for companies, coming back to Matador, is how to organize the field of play so that AI doesn't struggle. We easily lose the excitement of implementing AI in an organization when an AI is trying to navigate a maze of poorly organized files. For that, you need to build SOPs that tell everyone on the team, “We're going to be naming files this way now so that a 5-year-old can read the titles and understand what's in every one of them. Because if a 5-year-old can read this set of folders and understand what's inside all of them, then AI can do that too. And if AI can find and read everything, then AI can do some truly amazing things and save companies a lot of money. GO: So how are organizations like ours, which have been in operation for a long time, supposed to go back decades and reorganize all our files? EB: We can run a workflow that can do that for you. That's where the ROI comes in. You can make a one-time investment building a workflow that's going to completely standardize all your filing and foldering. But if you do that, you have to know that the ROI might not show up right away. It's going to start paying off later in terms of the time, money, stress and everything it’s going to give back. A CEO must understand that the return on that investment is going to be ongoing through the years, not in the next quarter necessarily. If you have that mentality, then your company is going to become AI-first. GO: You’ve told me before that AI is not a tool, it's a culture. Can you explain that? EB: Right now, the biggest obstacle for AI expanding in many companies are the CEOs. I understand the challenges because they fear a lot of reputational risk. You have a board and customers that are going to be judging you. If you don't have a very good AI road map, then it could turn into a failure, and the fingers are going to be pointing at you. I understand that completely. But AI should be a culture within companies, and that starts top down because the CEO has to embrace trial and error. AI is going to fail at least during the first time you start with any automation. It's like when you're building a prompt. We were talking the other day, and you said using AI is not about writing the perfect first prompt. It's that fifth or sixth prompt that's going to get you to the right answer. You're going to be iterating with automation, too. That's something CEOs have to transmit throughout the organization. GO: I think for many tourism organizations, we haven’t even begun talking about the big picture value of AI. From an internal perspective, for example, agents offer a whole new level for optimizing operations with AI. EB: Yes, exactly. When we're in a company and we're facing challenges, the first intuitive thinking is, "How can I solve this? I'm going to Google it.” Now we're transitioning to, "How can I solve this? I'm going to ask ChatGPT.” This is great, but that's not AI-first. That's changing one tool for another. You're still browsing. It's literally the same thing. You're not really using AI. AI-first means, "I do this thing that's consuming 10 hours a week. I do the same thing every time. I spend two hours every day doing the same four steps. How can I use AI to automate this?" That's AI-first because you're using AI to stop wasting time. I think that's the culture we should be striving for. If a CEO injects the whole company with that mindset, then the employees are going to eventually use AI to solve their issues more independently and autonomously. At the end of the day, what AI really does is gives us more time and more of our lives back, and we have not yet understood that because it's new. But it's true, AI is the way for humans to have more life. GO: I want that. EB: We all do. GO: I have this belief that eventually, in any organization, all meetings will be recorded and deposited into a central knowledge base where an AI can summarize everything and connect all the key takeaways. I might have a meeting and someone on the other side of the world has a meeting, and the AI will know we're talking about the same thing. It will see and surface how there's potential opportunity to connect our efforts. It's like one plus one equals three, or more. Do you think that's where we're going and that it will benefit companies? EB: Definitely. It's the most common sense thing to do, but I know it's also counterintuitive because there are many people who would not like to have all conversations recorded. The fidelity, the accuracy of the information, and it all being in one place and uniformly structured, is everything. You can have thousands of conversations and tell the AI, "Go here and search for this specific idea in all the transcripts where we have talked about that." You just need to build the SOPs. Then a human can quality control it and say, "This is right. This isn't right. Maybe we can tweak this, or build on that." GO: I’ve experienced this firsthand where people are vehemently against this idea of all company meetings being recorded. For many it portends that clichéd dystopic future we see in science fiction, where everything's controlled and you have no freedom, right? EB: I can see it too. We must remember that these tools can be turned off. If we let the technology control us, then that's on us. I think at the end of the day, it's about how do you balance the risk and rewards? This is something CEOs are used to. Do you prefer to live in blindness and have an uncompetitive company because you decided not to take that risk with automation? Or do you take the risk and have everything recorded, even though some people are going to say it’s Orwellian in a way, and even though ultimately it's going to improve everybody's life? We have to find that balance, and that’s the CEO’s role to determine what’s best overall for the company, customers and employees in the future. GO: Any last thoughts? EB: I think we are not quite there yet to know for sure the amount of ROI that is going to come from agents and automations. Definitely it is going to be positive ROI. For that, I'm completely sure. What I'm not sure is how do we measure ROI based on the anticipated lifetime value of the process? So much is changing so quickly and it's difficult to see the future. As the tools get better, then the workflow gets better too, so the ROI increases, right? Except, we don't really have models for that. For CEOs, I think, they have to try to envision how they can measure the value of automations now, and how that might evolve exponentially in the future. Greg Oates

What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates CEOs at destination marketing and management organizations (DMOs) are seeking AI guidance specifically tailored to their chief executive roles. A CEO in the U.S. told me recently that current AI education is often too surface level, vague, unstructured, or trying to cover too much ground to be useful for a chief executive. He said, "We've been talking for a while now about how we need AI education targeting leadership, but it doesn't really exist." While destination leaders face many more questions about AI than answers, one thing is 100% clear: CEOs must own and lead their organizations' AI integration across all departments. AI isn't something to outsource or delegate to others, and it's not a "marketing thing" for the CMO to figure out. Conor Grennan , chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, consults with clients on AI strategy from JPMorgan to NASA. I asked him how important it is for CEOs to lead AI education, adoption and integration across their organizations. “CEOs have to understand how to use AI and why; they really have to have felt the delight about what AI can do,” he said. "They also have to see clearly how AI is a leadership and change management challenge, not a tech challenge. Then they need to start out being vulnerable, and be able to say, ‘Hey, I was skeptical about AI. I didn’t understand it, either. But now I can explain the way I learned it and how to communicate why it’s important to help other people understand it.” So why do CEOs need to understand AI? Jeff Bezos answered that at The New York Times DealBook Summit last year. He described how “modern AI is a horizontal enabling layer" that will soon be integrated into every device and digital application in existence. "These kind of horizontal layers like electricity and compute and now artificial intelligence, they go everywhere," he said. "I guarantee you there is not a single application that you can think of that is not going to be made better by AI." Here's the clip: Strategic AI Approaches I met with about a dozen CEOs in North America to find out what they want to know about AI specifically from a CEO perspective. Some leaders are seeking big-picture guidance with a broad overview of high-level strategy. "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” one CEO told me. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" Another chief executive said, “We see three areas of opportunity for AI: Administrative tasks and general productivity; marketing chat, SEO and data readiness; and helping customers find information about our city more effectively.… The two most important things I want to know are how to develop AI policy and how is AI changing SEO." A year ago, most CEOs had a wait-and-see attitude about AI, following how the technology evolved and what their cohorts in other organizations were doing. Today, there is a general consensus among CEOs that they need to invest in AI, but the question is how and where. One CEO told me he knows he needs to integrate AI tools and processes into his DMO, but he has three overarching questions that he wants answered first, at least at a high level: “How do we create value with AI for the organization, our community and our residents? Everything we do has to benefit our residents.” “How do we explain that value to our team, our board, our partners and the community, and what are the KPIs? Those are the basics: How do we explain AI and how do we measure it?" “What do we need to develop and adopt in terms of ethics and policy?” Other CEOs are seeking clarity on the basic fundamentals of AI: "I need to understand what are the problems that we're trying to solve with AI. What is the purpose of a chatbot, for example? What am I buying, and what can we as an organization accomplish with it?" And then others just want immediate actionable solutions: "I'm not interested in hypotheticals. Show me five ways I can implement AI on Monday. Give me turnkey AI solutions that work today." AI Data is King Personalized data is one of generative AI’s biggest value propositions. Conversational AI (chat) is the new marketplace, and it’s eating the entire funnel including in-destination engagement. In some cities, AI chat conversations between DMOs and visitors is exceeding 25% in-destination, giving DMOs a way to influence visitor behavior in real time. Also, in some industry segments like tours and activities, in-chat conversations are driving in-destination bookings with partners like GetYourGuide. Everyone is looking for first/zero-party data around that. “We have a low level of proprietary data about who is in our destination and what they’re doing,” asserted one CEO. “We have a few disparate data sources, but we need to connect those, and we want to be able to use it predictively. For example, we're looking at regression analysis to help develop future scenario modeling, and we're looking at AI to help us with that." Another CEO said, “We need data that provides material value for our partners. That’s our mandate. How are our visitors spending money and where? How are they behaving and traveling through our area? How can we help people find our partners in a more personalized way?” And one CEO added, "A key priority for us is figuring out the data equation so outbound messaging can be tailored to a 1-on-1 relationship.” Striving for that direct individual customer engagement has been the holy grail for marketers for decades. The ability to deliver mass personalization at scale is now coming into focus with enhanced AI data curation. National organizations like Destination Canada and Germany Travel have invested millions of dollars in data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to restructure their tourism product data from scratch, capitalize on the data more effectively to rank higher in AI search, and drive incremental revenue to partners. That's what the future looks like. For more information, check out the new Canadian Tourism Data Collective and Germany's Open Data Project . Today, local tourism organizations are starting to see how data structure and content architecture are strategic imperatives for them, too. One municipal CEO explained, "I think it might almost be too early to have this conversation in some areas until AI matures more. One thing I am eager to know now is how do we develop a data lake to structure our own data and messaging to make it easier for AI search tools to find." AI search and SEO are a huge conversation today. During the past year, the #1 question I heard while speaking about AI with dozens of North American destination organizations, their boards and key industry/community stakeholders, was: How do we rank higher in AI search? What happens when AI buries organic content? What’s going to happen to our websites? Are they going to disappear? Is a DMO without a website still a DMO? How do we need to produce content differently? And, what the heck is a data lake? One CEO I spoke with is planning on developing a new website for her organization. She said, "I don't even know what I don't know about AI search, but we need to figure some of that out before we start spending any money." Along with data, defining KPIs for AI integration is a hot topic of debate, and presently there isn’t a complete and codified list of metrics that DMO leaders agree on. That said, perhaps the travel and tourism industry collectively needs to understand what AI is, and what it can accomplish at scale, before attaching too many metrics to it. A CMO told me at DI MarCom Summit this month, “People didn’t ask about ROI with the internet when it first came around. We just knew we had to have it,” because it was a new channel for reaching visitors. Same as AI now. Expanding on that, he suggested that DMOs need to break AI success tracking into awareness metrics and performance metrics, and get that conversation right before anything else. Staff AI Adoption Unlike previous technology evolutions, there doesn’t seem to be as much of a generational divide between early adopters of AI and everyone else. The industry can’t look to Gen Z for guidance about how to use AI to the same degree we once asked Millennials for insights about Instagram. Again, driving AI adoption across an organization begins with the CEO. Once that’s established, the real challenge is convincing department leaders and staff to lean into AI. It's a challenge because there is widespread concern, skepticism and/or suspicion among many staff members across many industries that they’re being asked to learn new technologies that will eventually replace them. Leadership should say to employees that no one can force them to use AI, but the job market will. The data is clear. According to the Linkedin/Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index : 79% of leaders agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with Al skills than a more experienced one without 66% of leaders won’t hire someone without AI skills 60% of leaders worry their organization lacks a plan and vision to implement AI And that's a year old. But, understandably, emphasizing those numbers comes across as threatening. A better strategy for driving AI adoption is finding staff members who are already seeing success with AI, supporting them with access to education and pro AI models, and working out from there. The more employees see their colleagues using AI, the more some of them feel inclined to lean in. Therefore, every DMO needs a comprehensive strategic AI road map that includes purpose, policy, education, integration and a continuous feedback loop across all levels of staff. CEOs need to create a space for that. "We're giving our staff time to play around with AI, but they have to present what they're focusing on and what they're learning to their individual supervisor," a CEO told me. Another added, “We're focusing on staff adoption. But I need you to explain to me what works, how to implement, and what should I watch out for." I'm presently working with our departments at Matador Network to explore a bunch of various AI models to optimize workflows, boost creativity, enhance strategic planning, diversify product, etc. There's a well-communicated mandate from the top that Matador will become an AI-first company, and sooner than later. To help accelerate that, we created an AI task force to bring more perspectives from across the company together to integrate AI into operations. That has been valuable with some immediate takeaways, such as staff is now reaching out and asking for assistance with AI. But it's only a start. "There's this idea that if you can get a core group of people using AI then their attitudes and behaviors will spread organically throughout the rest of the company," said Conor Grennan at NYU. "It doesn't work that way. You have to find the people who have fears about AI and listen to them to understand why. You have to say, 'Yes, AI does suck at that, but here's what it's good at.' You also need to weed out the negative people who are against AI outright. They're dangerous." 5 Key Takeaways Let's go back to that first CEO who wants to know the five big questions about AI. Based on the input from the above CEOs, here's a first stab at that: How can I create AI policy that serves our organization but doesn't suppress experimentation among staff? (Interestingly, policy did not come up that much with the CEOs I spoke with.) How do we need to develop our websites, content and data to rank higher in AI search? How is AI SEO different, and the same, as old SEO? What are existing AI chat platforms accomplishing, how are visitors using them, and how are they influencing travel decision making and purchase behavior? If AI is not just for marketing, what does the ecosystem of AI tools for all departments look like across the organization? And what do they do in terms of increasing productivity, creativity and quality? How do I get staff to buy in? We know AI is an imperative for our organization's competitive advantage and relevance. And we know AI is an imperative for employees for their professional growth and marketability. But how do we get our people to really believe in the need to embrace AI? Greg Oates

Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Royce Chwin, president and CEO of Destination Vancouver , personifies how a DMO chief executive needs to establish and articulate the mandate for integrating AI across the organization. That was the topic of our last Destination AI post where 12 CEOs explained: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . Early in 2024, Chwin addressed the full staff in Destination Vancouver’s office before a session I was presenting there on AI. “We cannot not do this,” he said, stating that the organization needed to adopt AI processes to stay relevant in the industry and increase its value in the community. If Destination Vancouver is positioning itself as an innovative DMO, he explained, then the road ahead with AI was clear. Since then, Destination Vancouver launched a new website fully integrated with AI where visitors can customize how they find travel information. The build was a two-year process requiring an inordinate amount of learning to capitalize on generative AI. The team also developed an AI policy guide that Chwin shared for this post. The comprehensive document is designed to "provide clear protocols that maximize and encourage the use of Al tools where appropriate and safe to do so, while minimizing any potential risks and concerns." The policy guide encourages staff to use AI for "enhancing productivity, efficiency, creativity or decision-making." It defines when not to use AI models and how staff is required to review and validate all AI outputs for accuracy and bias. Also, Stefan Hawes, vp of global marketing, initiated the development of an internal AI Council, bringing together a diverse group of staff to coordinate AI processes across the organization. Chwin shared an internal briefing report outlining the purpose of the Council as follows: It is recommended that an AI Council be established immediately to provide a centralized body for managing AI-related initiatives and to expand training opportunities for team members. The Council will focus on: Setting strategic priorities related to AI Selecting use cases, implementing projects/initiatives/AI software purchases and evaluating their effectiveness Developing a data strategy to support AI adoption and initiatives Developing an AI education, literacy and adoption program Ensuring ethical compliance Fostering cross-departmental collaboration to maximize the impact of AI projects We created a similar AI task force at Matador, and the value of that cannot be overstated to better assess how staff from different departments perceive, and misperceive, AI in general. I talked with Chwin this week to better understand how a DMO CEO can best lead strategic AI implementation across his or her organization. The purpose of this post is to help inform, inspire and influence other CEOs to consider the opportunities of AI in a new light. Greg Oates: Royce, you've been a strident proponent of AI for a couple years now, and yet there are many other CEOs who are still reticent. How did you personally come to decide Destination Vancouver needed to embrace AI? Royce Chwin: The perception still of some DMOs is that we are behind when it comes to technology. We're slow to adapt. We're slow to evolve. You see all these other organizations in the travel sphere around us that are able to move much quicker. They might be capitalized better. They can adjust. They can pivot quicker to take on these new technologies, and they can experiment seemingly without the degree of fear or consternation that maybe some DMOs have. So, I think there's lots of different reasons. For us, I mean, it's day and night. We can't not do that. Our entire ecosystem that we play in has some level of AI being used. Number one is our customers. They’re using AI. So it goes back to that same idea that you and I have discussed many times before: How do we as a DMO stay relevant and how do we show value? AI is a response to answering those two things. GO: In many organizations today, there’s often skepticism and suspicion among staff about how AI might take their jobs, or they’re dismissive of AI altogether. How does your team feel about AI overall? RC: I'm not finding a fear in our organization for using AI. I think it's a different set of challenges. I think there are so many derivatives of AI out there that people don't know what to focus on. Because you can’t and don't need to focus on 40 different AI tools. The question is, what are the best tools that are most relevant to the work that I need to do? That, I think, in my experience is a bigger challenge. My sense of it is that AI can be so overwhelming. It can seem unbelievably complicated. So we had to ask ourselves, do we have the time, resources and skill sets to simply understand it? Secondly, are we asking better questions to understand what in the organization we need to solve, and can AI help? GO: In a previous post, I shared input from 12 DMO CEOs about how they feel about AI. What are you hearing from other CEOs? RC: I was over in Europe recently for Destinations International’s Global Leaders Forum where I was onstage with Sherrif Karamat (CEO of PCMA) and Petra Stušek (CEO at Ljubljana Tourism). We were talking about the importance of face-to-face meetings and so on, and Sherrif made a comment that DMOs are really behind using AI. It was kind of a blanket statement, and he's not wrong. But, I said to Sheriff that I think a lot of DMOs are behind because it's like throwing confetti in somebody's face and asking them to pick the best pieces. They don't even know what they're trying to evaluate, and it’s also moving so fast. In the meantime, our customers are running around us using AI for all kinds of things. And so I think that there's not so much a fear of using AI. It’s more that people are questioning how to respond to the increasing emergence of AI because they’re thinking, “I'm not really 100% clear on the business problem I'm trying to solve that supports my mandate.” For us, and you saw it when you visited, we were really clear on what it is that we needed to do. We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI. “We needed to adopt AI and remove the fear. We said use it. We’re going to make some mistakes, sure, but we just need to use it. You're not going to learn AI if you don't use AI.” GO: I’ve been asserting that CEOs should own and lead AI adoption in their organizations to have the best chance for success. I don't mean lead it day to day. I mean the chief executive must establish the mandate that AI is something the organization is going to invest in, and articulate why and how to the entire staff. Connor Grennan, chief AI architect at NYU Stern School of Business, emphasized to me that’s the only way this works. Do you agree? RC: Yes, I absolutely believe it must come from the CEO because the CEO has to clear the vision with the team. And with something as seismic as AI, and how it’s evolving in our daily life, in our world, I think the CEO has a responsibility to address it and how it will impact the organization. Everyone needs to understand how we’re going to use AI in alignment with our mission and strategic goals, and how it will support the mandate. That's all CEO level. That's the responsibility on my head. Also, I can't imagine going in front of my Board and asking, “Hey, what are you doing with AI? What should we do with AI?” So it has to come from the CEO, but my Board has also enabled me. Like, there's no grief from my Board. Zero. We are fully enabled. GO: You've created the necessary structure to help govern AI integration with your AI Policy and AI Council. Can you expand on the thinking behind those? RC: We developed an AI policy that’s designed to enable people to use AI and not discourage them from experimenting. Obviously, some education is required in terms of proprietary information and those kinds of things. But we're really leaning into this and we're going to assign some time for it to enable the organization to experiment and play with AI without fear of reprisal. Naturally there needs to be governance around it, but governance does not mean stopping creativity. Governance means we’re creating and delivering new opportunities for creativity. There just needs to be structure around that. Also, Stefan came up with the idea of pulling together an AI Council in the organization, which I think is fantastic. We're getting individuals from each business line, including myself, and we’re going to talk about AI, its impacts, what we need to be thinking about, and how we'll improve our website and the organization as a whole. So we're creating dialogue around it to define opportunities. For example, I'm really excited about AI as it relates to all the country market analysis that we do. We've been doing that by spreadsheet, but now we’re exploring AI to provide the insights we need to inform our market planning more effectively. There are lots of different examples like that, but you only discover them by being open to experimenting with AI. Greg Oates

Toronto & Denver Tourism Leaders on the 5 Big AI Questions for CEOs Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates A year from now, the travel and tourism sector might look back and thank Andrew Weir, president and CEO of Destination Toronto , for catalyzing how DMOs move forward with AI. At PCMA Convening Leaders in January this year, I asked Weir what CEOs need to understand about AI at a high level. Numerous other CEOs have told me there’s a complete lack of AI education specifically designed for DMO chief executives. His answer was first shared anonymously in our previous post, What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI . "Tell me the five big questions about AI that I need to know, and what people are saying about them,” said Weir. “You don't have to answer those questions but just tell me what I need to focus on. And tell me what people don't want to talk about. What makes them squirm? Like, if AI is changing how people are searching for destinations, then how much should I stop paying Google?" At the end of that post I suggested what those five questions might be based on all the CEO insights in there, and I've since been shopping them around to vet them. A few weeks ago, for example, Richard Scharf, president and CEO at Visit Denver , suggested restructuring the questions to create a more logical hierarchy. Now, the first three deal with internal operations while the last two identify external, visitor-facing priorities. Yesterday, I spoke again with Weir, as well as Paula Port, vice president of marketing at Destination Toronto, for their input on the five questions. The goal here is to provide clear structure around AI platforms and processes for DMOs leading up to Matador Network’s collaboration with U.S. Travel at ESTO in Phoenix this fall. Together, we’ll be co-hosting an interactive, multi-station “AI Playground” educational activation during the three days of the conference. Here are the five big AI questions. These will evolve but now we have a foundation to begin building consensus on how DMOs can capitalize on opportunities and navigate challenges with AI today. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? The 5 Big AI Questions 1. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who all have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? A growing number of DMO leaders say their teams embrace AI for the most part, and many are actively developing basic AI strategy. That’s a significant shift from a year ago. At the same time, there's still varying degrees of cynicism and skepticism about AI in other organizations. I asked Weir about his staff. “I don't feel like we're dragging the team into this,” he said. “It's really more a matter of how people are at such different places with AI. So our goal is figuring out how to channel all their knowledge and energy, and kind of align and unify that, without stifling anyone’s creativity.” Scharf at Visit Denver emphasized that this question should be the first one, because successful AI integration begins with understanding your staff’s grasp of AI and their appetite for leaning into it. “ChatGPT is growing like Zoom did a few years ago so we know we need to use it,” he said. “The first thing we did was survey staff to assess how they feel about AI, and how or if they’re using it. Then we started off with small bites like email. Now we think of AI as a toolkit, and we're continuing to explore what tools are appropriate for different needs.” Port added that AI integration across teams works best with both structured and self-directed learning. “We started by making everything (ChatGPT Plus, Google Gemini) available to everyone, so they were given access to tools and resources, but a lot of this is really self-directed learning,” she said. “What we're seeing now is people have taken advantage of that and moved forward with it. Some maybe a little bit further than others, so maybe we need to address that. I think we still need more use cases and more structured learning because we're not all at the same level in terms of knowing and understanding how to put AI to use.” 2. How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? Destination Toronto was one of the first North American municipal DMOs to develop an AI policy. They began the process by pulling examples from larger government-operated tourism organizations including Destination Canada and Destination British Columbia. “We set up that policy structure first in terms of what we wanted as an organization, and also being very clear that any use of AI was meant to drive business results,” said Weir. “I think we were able to get there pretty quickly because we didn't create a series of regulations. We built a series of philosophies and principles to guide where we go. It was meant to put guardrails around protecting information, while at the same time, stimulate learning and sharing. Because we said to the team that you are free and encouraged to use AI, but there is an expectation that you will share what you've learned.” Port explained further that, “We leveraged existing processes already in place from a content perspective in terms of bias, IT usage, etc. We have an assessment process for any sort of software application that we're looking to use, so we did the same with AI.” (Note: The next GuideGeek Destination AI post will be with Kara Franker, president and CEO of Visit Florida Keys, who is also an attorney. We discussed AI policy at length.) 3. How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? Scharf stated that integrating AI platforms and processes beyond marketing is “where all the work is happening now.” His organization is switching out regular stand up meetings with extended AI workshops and visiting speakers to learn more about AI tools for various use cases across departments. Leadership, he said, including himself, are present at these meetings so everyone is learning together. Weir and Port both addressed this question, saying they need to first explore how Simpleview, Cvent and other tech partners are integrating AI functionality before looking at any new AI platforms. We discussed PCMA’s Project Spark , an AI-native event development tool that includes the new Destinaitor destination sourcing platform. DMO leadership and sales teams are exploring Spark to understand how clients are using new AI software to evaluate, compare and source destinations for business events. Others, like Kara Franker mentioned above, are looking for new AI solutions to optimize their HR and accounting departments, but she said many of the available options presently are only enterprise grade. Something DMOs should really look at, and I’m not sure how/if many already are, but there is proven value in creating custom GPTs for sales teams. GPTs are like mini ChatGPTs designed for specific purposes that anyone with a ChatGPT Plus account can create. For example, a sales rep can build a knowledge base inside a GPT by uploading sales materials, examples of successful bids, product information, pricing, team members, case studies, testimonials and other data. The next step is to develop internal GPT instructions to direct what the GPT does and what it prioritizes. Following that, the rep can then chat with the GPT and ask it to create a customized bid for a potential client that pulls all relevant source materials from the knowledge base that best supports the pitch. I’m imagining the ability to create custom GPTs is going to soon be a standard and required capability for all sales teams. One of the earliest enterprise examples of this was Salesforce’s Einstein GPT, which has since morphed into Agentforce. We use them at Matador because of improved efficiency and quality. GPTs also provide a new option for creative brainstorming, which some salespeople appreciate who don't identify as being super creative. Increases in sales production can be clearly identified. However, there's increasing conversation about tracking success in other departments. When AI delivers clear improvements in efficiency and saves people significant time, how do you measure that? One concern is that people will then just work a six hour day versus eight hours. The common thinking is that organizations will need to adjust productivity benchmarks, but this is a messy conversation. I don’t know enough to comment on that yet, but I wanted to put a pin in it because it’s something we’ll all need to look at eventually as AI scales in the workforce. 4. How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? I was addressing Visit Denver’s Board a while back and one member suggested that DMOs won’t need websites soon because they’ll be replaced by a ChatGPT-like window. I’m surprised by how much this comes up. For one thing, DMOs will always need some kind of online knowledge base for AI search queries. If anything, that will require more content and more comprehensive product information because AI search thrives more than anything on data structure, clarity and specificity. That said, the web user interface will likely evolve considerably. Expect to hear a lot more about how DMOs are developing data lakes/warehouses and knowledge graphs to optimize data structure for AI search. For further context, here's a Perplexity Pro response to the question: "Are tourism boards developing data lakes and warehouses to optimize their sites for AI search?" Weir suggested that this conversation about the future of websites is not unlike what we went through 15 years ago, when people were lamenting the death of DMO sites because social media was deemed by some as the new web. More important, he asserted, is seeing how AI search is evolving and being prepared to adapt strategy. “I think there is a push-pull here between how we lead and where customers are at,” said Weir. “We want to deliver more information through our AI assistant and AI search in general, but customers aren't really there yet. I don't know what the percentage is, but the majority of people are still using Google. They're still beginning an interaction on the web by entering search terms in Google the traditional way. At some point, that's going to flip, right? It's going to be a few percent more each month or quarter, whatever that is. But how far ahead of it do we get? And how do we calibrate? We can try to lead on this, but you know, we also have to stay in step with where our customers are too.” 5. How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? Chat platforms for DMOs like GuideGeek AI have dashboards that clearly identify what visitors are asking about in the destination. That helps inform content and product development strategy, and the data is valuable for community engagement. AI chat platforms also operate 24/7 in 50+ languages, which helps DMO influence in-destination travel and spending for a much wider audience than ever before. How to best capitalize on conversational AI, and ultimately conversational commerce, is an evolving topic because we’re still in the early days where travelers are learning they can search with large language models and trust them. ChatGPT has 400 million weekly users but ChatGPT only added full functioning search capability for all users a few months ago. Consumers are just beginning to understand that they can now “talk” to a city. To help accelerate understanding and adoption of AI chat among visitors, Port asserted that the onus is on DMOs to promote their AI chat robustly like any other channel. Weir did that recently by highlighting Destination Toronto’s GuideGeek-powered “6ix” chat platform on LinkedIn, asking, “Ever had a chat directly with a city?” Weir was specifically promoting the organization’s WhatsApp platform, where people can now have a highly personalized, iterative conversation directly with Destination Toronto via the GuideGeek AI integration. The same functionality exists with the other Meta platforms, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. A few hours after Weir's post I received a Slack message from our CTO Stefan Klopp wondering what was going on in Toronto. WhatsApp volume was spiking, he said, and he was asking if Toronto had sent out a press release promoting 6ix, or something. No, it was just a quick CEO social media post. Also, Tourism New Zealand just launched a new campaign in collaboration with “A Minecraft Movie” that integrates GuideGeek-powered prompt questions to trigger further engagement. So, those are just a couple examples of how DMO/NTOs can drive AI chat engagement. The question for Weir and Port though is about the types of questions people are asking in AI chat platforms. Presently, a lot of the chat conversations are more utilitarian, related to queries about hotels, restaurants, attractions, events, directions, etc. So as conversational AI adoption increases, will DMOs focus more on developing content that answers those basic types of questions, like what hotel, restaurant or attraction is highly rated, and how to get there. Or, should DMOs continue to focus mainly on developing what is generally perceived as more inspirational destination and experiential content? "The question then becomes about responding to inquiries versus the inspirational side," explained Port. "Like, all of these articles, all of this content that we serve up, that is not in response to a question per se. It's more packaged to inspire people. I think a lot of that's going to have to exist outside our environments, maybe, whether it's influencers, it's your earned media strategy, it's content partnerships, things like that. That's where I think the inspiration will exist. But we really have to move to being more of the informative one, on our website or whatever a website is. But it needs to be very specific in answering questions. We already see that on GuideGeek." Weir summed up, saying, "I think this ends up relating more to, again, that question of where the customers are. Are we putting ourselves in a position to answer their questions and deliver the information in the way they're looking for it, using AI and the data lake approach? Or, are we curators like we've always been, inspiring visitors with local experiences, or is the customer now the curator by virtue of how they're asking questions today?" Summary These five takeaways are aligned with the five big AI questions. AI adoption begins with talking to DMO staff to understand what the organization is working with. Love the idea about marrying structured and self-directed learning, and being intentional about that with staff. At some point, for AI adoption to scale and continually evolve on an ongoing basis, there needs to be AI leaders in any organization who pick up the torch and inspire their colleagues to lean into AI. Otherwise, things tend to plateau with the same people using the same AI models. AI policy is intended to encourage staff to innovate with AI as much as it's meant to protect organizations. AI is the death of "I don't know," so it can benefit all staff in all departments. That in itself is enough ROI to validate initial investments in AI. The tools can provide a foundation of knowledge and direction for problem solving and strategic planning exponentially better than traditional search. Some organizations, like Visit Greece who we work with, have phenomenal website data structure ideally optimized for AI search. Meanwhile, one CEO told me "Our website is a mess with outdated content and poor data structure. We need to rebuild from scratch with AI search top of mind." Chat is the new marketplace, and AI is eating the entire funnel including in-destination. Moreover, AI chat data provides DMO leaders with insights into what visitors are asking about. Although, I think as chat adoption scales mainstream, the conversations will evolve beyond asking for a good hotel or restaurant. Greg Oates

Why Small Steps With AI Create Big Wins for Tourism Organizations Sep 22 Written By Greg Oates Key Theme: How to Align Strategic Risk Management and Progressive AI Implementation The rush to transform everything with AI has dominated boardroom discussions since ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Yet the most successful organizations aren't pursuing wholesale AI overhauls. They're taking calculated, incremental steps that deliver real value while building capabilities for the future. MIT researchers interviewed senior managers at 21 large companies actively using generative AI. Their findings challenge the prevailing narrative about AI transformation. Companies are deliberately choosing "small t" transformations over risky, large-scale implementations. This approach works particularly well for tourism organizations where customer trust and regulatory compliance matter deeply. Tourism organizations face unique challenges with AI adoption. Customer data privacy concerns run high. Regulatory requirements vary across jurisdictions. Service quality directly impacts reputation. The research reveals that successful companies treat AI implementation like climbing a risk slope. They start with low-risk internal applications before moving to customer-facing solutions. This measured approach isn't about being timid. It's about being smart. Tourism CEOs can build organizational confidence, develop necessary skills, and demonstrate tangible value before tackling more complex implementations. Start With Universal Productivity Tools That Employees Already Want to Use The research uncovered a surprising reality. Employees were already using ChatGPT and other public AI tools without permission. Companies responded by providing secure, private versions of these tools. This grassroots adoption pattern offers tourism organizations a clear starting point. Consider how your marketing team writes destination descriptions. Your operations staff creates training materials. Your finance team prepares reports. These tasks consume hours of employee time across every department. Private AI instances from providers like ChatGPT or Claude eliminate security concerns while boosting productivity. McKinsey built a custom platform called Lilli that connects AI to 40 internal knowledge sources. The result? Seventy-five percent employee adoption in under a year. Time savings up to 30%. Substantially improved work quality. Tourism organizations don't need to build something this sophisticated initially. Even basic AI writing assistants can transform daily work. Microsoft Copilot integration takes this further. Employees can search across company documents instantly. They can pull content from emails, meeting transcripts, and presentations. One manager described it as having "a super search engine" for company information. Imagine your team finding that obscure policy document from three years ago in seconds rather than hours. The beauty of starting here? Minimal risk. Maximum adoption. Employees want these tools. They're probably already using consumer versions. Providing enterprise versions addresses security concerns while meeting existing demand. Your IT team maintains control. Your employees get productivity gains. Everyone wins. Some employees will still seek external tools for specific needs. One product manager uses Midjourney for quick visuals. Another uses voice-to-text tools for performance reviews. Accept this reality. Focus on providing core tools internally while establishing clear guidelines for external tool usage. Deploy AI for Specific Roles While Keeping Humans in Control Once basic AI tools gain traction, tourism organizations can target specific job functions. The key insight from the research? Maintain human oversight for quality control. This "human in the loop" approach reduces risk while capturing efficiency gains. Customer service represents an ideal starting point for tourism organizations. AI can help agents find information quickly. It can suggest responses in real time. It can analyze call patterns to identify coaching opportunities. MIT researchers found AI coaching tools increased call center productivity by 14% on average. New and low-skilled workers improved by 34%. Morgan Stanley equipped financial advisors with an AI assistant trained on over one million internal documents. The tool doesn't replace advisors. It helps them find information faster so they can focus on customer relationships. Tourism organizations can apply this same principle. Help your concierge staff access local recommendations instantly. Enable tour guides to answer obscure historical questions accurately. Support reservation agents with instant access to availability across properties. CarMax demonstrates another powerful application. The company uses AI to generate descriptions for over 5,000 car pages. Manual creation would take multiple humans 11 years. With AI, it takes hours. The 80% approval rate from editorial review proves quality doesn't suffer. Tourism organizations can apply this to property descriptions, tour summaries, and destination guides. Creative teams at Dentsu use AI throughout their workflow. From proposals to budgeting to ideation. The emerging technology director noted employees spend less time on mundane tasks. They create higher-quality content with less effort. Tourism marketing teams can similarly accelerate campaign development, social media content creation, and promotional material design. Finance departments traditionally resist new technology. Yet some organizations successfully use AI for audit reports, regulatory compliance, and fraud detection. Amazon's finance team reports employees shifted from repetitive tasks to critical thinking work. Tourism organizations can start with expense report processing or invoice matching before tackling complex financial analysis. Transform Customer Experiences Gradually With Clear Boundaries Customer-facing AI sits highest on the risk slope. Yet the potential rewards justify careful exploration. The research shows companies succeeding by setting clear boundaries and expanding gradually. Chatbots evolved from frustrating phone trees to sophisticated conversational agents. John Hancock's insurance chatbots handle common queries effectively. Human agents focus on complex issues. Starbucks, Domino's, and CVS expanded to voice interactions. Video interactions come next. Tourism organizations can start with FAQ chatbots on their websites. Add booking assistance once that works well. Expand to voice-based concierge services when ready. Personalization transforms online shopping experiences. Tapestry, parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, uses real-time language modifications. The conversational tone mimics in-store associates. Revenue increased at least 3%. Tourism organizations can personalize trip recommendations based on past bookings. Adjust website content for different traveler segments. Customize email campaigns for individual preferences. Software companies already embed AI throughout their products. Adobe users create and modify images effortlessly. Canva simplifies presentation creation. Lucidchart converts text descriptions into flowcharts. Tourism organizations benefit as their existing software vendors add AI features. Property management systems will suggest optimal pricing. Booking platforms will predict cancellation risks. Marketing tools will automate campaign optimization. The key? Start small. Test thoroughly. Expand gradually. A failed internal productivity tool frustrates employees. A failed customer-facing AI damages your brand. Move up the risk slope deliberately. Build Foundational Capabilities Before Attempting Major Transformations The research revealed an uncomfortable truth. Scaling AI from pilot to production is harder than expected. Data quality issues multiply. Edge cases appear more frequently. Integration challenges compound. Many organizations discovered they needed stronger foundations before pursuing ambitious AI projects. CarMax's chief information officer emphasized data quality. "Good data will give you good results from AI." Poor data produces unreliable outputs. Tourism organizations must audit their data systems. Customer records across multiple systems need reconciliation. Historical booking data requires cleaning. Property information needs standardization. Governance structures matter equally. Who approves AI projects? How do you measure success? What happens when AI makes mistakes? Establish these frameworks before scaling implementations. Small pilots can proceed without perfect governance. Enterprise deployments cannot. Capital One's chief scientist warned against the "gold-rush mentality." Thoughtful, responsible implementation beats rushed deployment. Build the scaffolding to bring everyone along. Tourism organizations should resist pressure to match competitors' AI announcements. Focus on sustainable progress over headlines. Management buy-in proves essential for larger projects. One technology company's AI efforts stagnated until the CEO personally championed them. Small wins build credibility for bigger investments. Document productivity gains from initial deployments. Share customer satisfaction improvements. Make the business case concrete before requesting major funding. Summary: Small Transformations Today Enable Big Transformations Tomorrow The research delivers a clear message for tourism CEOs. Successful AI implementation doesn't require revolutionary change. It requires evolutionary progress. Start with universal productivity tools that employees already want. Target specific roles with human oversight. Transform customer experiences within careful boundaries. Build foundational capabilities systematically. This approach particularly suits tourism organizations. Your business depends on human connections. Technology should enhance these connections, not replace them. Your customers value authentic experiences. AI should enable better experiences, not artificial ones. Your reputation takes years to build and moments to destroy. Measured AI deployment protects what you've built while enabling future growth. The companies studied aren't waiting for perfect AI solutions. They're using today's technology to solve real problems while preparing for tomorrow's possibilities. They're training employees, cleaning data, and establishing governance. When breakthrough AI capabilities arrive, they'll be ready to capitalize quickly. Tourism organizations can follow this same path. Deploy AI writing assistants next month. Add customer service chatbots next quarter. Enhance personalization next year. Each step builds on the last. Each success enables the next. Small transformations compound into competitive advantage. The AI transformation race isn't won by the fastest starter. It's won by consistent, strategic progress. Tourism CEOs who embrace "small t" transformation today position their organizations for "big T" transformation tomorrow. The journey starts with a single step up the risk slope. Greg Oates

How to Develop AI Strategy for Your Organization Oct 12 Written By Greg Oates The 2050 City AI Roadmap provides a high-level strategic framework for how DMOs and other organizations can capitalize on AI to optimize internal operations, resources and knowledge, and ultimately, drive partner revenue. DMOs have all kinds of strategic plans, master plans, business and marketing plans, etc. The 2050 City AI Roadmap outlines the process to develop your AI strategic plan. It defines the big picture outlook for AI as the future of commerce, and it proposes a methodology to help DMO leaders prioritize, organize and navigate how they go about integrating AI across their organization. Presently, we're rolling this out with Visit Mesa , Tourism Richmond in British Columbia, and The Florida Keys & Key West . The three CEOs for those organizations have all agreed to share takeaways and business outcomes with each others' teams to cross-pollinate learning and accelerate AI process integration. That spirit of knowledge sharing and co-learning for me is huge, because we as an industry are all pretty much flying blindly with AI from a macro perspective. Yes, we've come a long way in the last year. Every DMO CEO I talk to these days is now implementing various AI processes and seeing value. However, we're all kind of flying this plane while we're building it at the same time, and we don't really have a destination, or even due north, in mind. The 2050 City AI Roadmap was designed to identify where we're going with this emergent technology that's both incredibly powerful and often highly unpredictable. It also defines how high-end AI chat platforms, like Matador Network's GuideGeek AI , are the tip of the spear for agentic commerce. The following guidelines are based on experience in the workplace to deliver new value with AI for your team, board, industry partners and community stakeholders. Internal & External Direction Every decision related to AI strategy should first be defined through an internal or external lens. Your board members will typically view internal workplace optimization as tactical. Externally, AI integrations that are consumer-facing and revenue generating are usually perceived as more strategic. Internal Facing From an internal standpoint, the focus of the AI Roadmap is on optimizing operations to take advantage of an organization's aggregate of resources and knowledge. Imagine the totality of insights across every team member in terms of their expertise and networks in their communities. AI systems are designed to pool and capitalize on that, but only if an organization's knowledge base is structured intelligently. That means rebuilding your folder structures and files naming conventions so an AI can find everything. According to Slack, workers spend 41% of their time on menial tasks, including endless hours just looking for information. The overall losses related to productivity, quality of work and workplace, and physical/mental health are crazy. So let's start there with AI strategy to address our internal digital dumpster fire. External Facing Externally, from a marketing, sales and visitor/partner engagement perspective, AI strategy begins with integrating a robust AI chat platform like GuideGeek. DMOs have never really had proprietary information on who their visitors are. They have geo-location, credit card spend, event attendance data, etc., which show visitor behavior. But none of those really identify visitor motivations and mindsets indepth. With an AI chat platform, DMOs can now pull analytics showing what visitors are actually asking and what they want to know on an individual and aggregate basis. We launched our new GuideGeek V2 analytics dashboard this past week, which provides deeper, fuller insights into visitor psychographics. That data then informs all kinds of resource allocation decisions related to content development, AI SEO strategy, data analysis, product and destination development, community engagement, etc. CEO Roles AI is best defined as a new digital "co-intelligence" that can communicate, reason and create for the first time ever, versus just another new technology. We emphasize that AI is really a new environment for collaboration more than anything, just not solely among humans anymore. Learning AI is not like learning Photoshop. You can only "teach" AI up to a point, like trying to teach someone how to ride a bike. You can't teach a child how to stay on two wheels without falling in a classroom. He or she actually has to start pedaling, and eventually the child's mind and body basically have a conversation, so to speak, with the bike to grasp the fundamentals of moving forward successfully. Same with AI. The only way to learn AI is to use AI. Helping human teams embrace this new co-intelligence (and it's not like there's a choice) falls under the umbrella of change management. That's a CEO's wheelhouse. It will take more than a few years for many humans to reconcile their minds and values with this new relationship, and it falls on the CEO's shoulders to steward that reconciliation. Likewise, CEOs oversee AI governance, policy and privacy. I've shared before how AI governance should be viewed less like a car brake and more like a steering wheel to inform, direct and accelerate AI adoption and integration. Lastly, only CEOs can scale long-term AI benefits and business outcomes effectively. You can't really delegate this. AI efforts will plateau at times, some or many AI experimentations will fail, and there are always staff members who will drag their feet because they just don't like AI. DMO CEOs are chief people officers and it's on them to create the right culture for scaling AI platforms and processes effectively for everyone in their crews. Agentic AI This is where things get interesting. AI agents and agentic commerce might sound super confusing for many or most staff members. Lots of land mines to watch out for, sure, but even more reasons for us building a macro DMO AI strategic framework. One of the key objectives for the AI Roadmap is to elevate AI agents and agentic commerce as the two interrelated cornerstones for AI strategy, and explain why. Doing so shows the true big picture value of AI, and it drives home how we eventually need to move way beyond training people the basics of prompting. Yes, it's intimidating, but we introduce the labels and contexts relating to agentic AI early on in the process. That gets some people thinking bigger about AI, and it entices the AI champions in the group to start experimenting with agents. AI Agents (Internal) For internal AI strategy, leading DMOs are developing AI agents and automated workflows to address the aforementioned 41% of time that staff members spend on grunt work and trying to find information. They are proven, they work, and most of all, they deliver measurable ROI. We're working with outside contractors at Matador to develop and implement agents and automations for both ourselves internally and for DMO clients. We are already seeing success, and there's been a recent influx among our people asking for agents. It's an amazing thing to see when staff members start requesting new AI integrations like that, proactively. That's when you know your AI strategy is working at least on some level. Agentic Commerce (External) AI agents are also the foundation for agentic commerce. According to Mastercard , "Agentic commerce is a new form of online and mobile shopping, in which an AI agent 'closes the loop' or completes tasks for a user — such as searching for items, comparing options and making a purchase — with limited or no manual inputs needed from that user. For example, while chatting in a generative AI app, you could tell the AI agent, 'Book me a nonstop flight to London for under $600 next week — no red-eyes,' and the agent will review airlines, nearby airports and your loyalty memberships and payment card rewards to identify the best option, purchase it and then share it with you." Just like with AI agents, developing agentic commerce architecture covers a wide spectrum of sophistication and capabilities. Going back to the analogy of flying a plane while building it with no clear final destination in mind, agentic commerce is the point on the map where we want to land. With GuideGeek, we have Kayak, GetYourGuide, Skyscanner and other booking tools integrated into the platform with a click-through UX/UI. Looking ahead, we're working with one national tourism organization to bring some of their national partners' booking engines (air, hotel, tour op, etc.,) into the platform to eventually convert sales in-chat. Subscribe to Mastercard Signals to keep up-to-date on agentic commerce and access intelligence like this Mastercard Payments Trends Navigator report. Staff Training & AI Integration Training staff and implementing AI processes across all departments is really the meat of the 2050 City Roadmap. But none of that should proceed without DMO leadership embracing all the above, and communicating it clearly to all staff. Easier said than done, though. Leadership needs to continually communicate a high-level approach to AI strategy, because it won't really click for many staff (or leadership) at the beginning of this process. That, of course, needs to be married with all the practical training initiatives we're continuing to develop. We've already learned a ton with the present work we're doing training DMO teams. Here are a few very basic takeaways just to start explaining our process. There are obviously many more educational modules following these, ranging from predictive analytics to specific department AI training in areas like HR, finance and legal. Conduct an internal AI survey asking all staff to share their perceptions and usage of AI. Follow that up with small group interviews across the organization, and transcribe everything with an AI notetaker. We use Granola, but there are many others. Also, explain to staff that all meetings regarding AI will be recorded to create an internal knowledge base to identify opportunities, challenges and takeaways over time. Start training with a focus on just the paid/pro models of ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. Some staff feel confused with the sheer variety of available AI tools in front of them. We explain that, at the end of the day, the basics of using AI include an end user, an AI tool, and a knowledge base. Get people on board with that, and then show how most of the AI tools they have access to are similar in many ways. One of the fastest methods to advance AI understanding is showing staff how to create custom GPTs in ChatGPT. Some team members will pick up on these quickly and start integrating them into their workflows right away. These are the people who typically make up your internal AI taskforce. Explain and show how Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot are AI workhorses that connect with the majority of people's daily workflows. However, humans tend to think of those as just the next evolution of search engines. This is mental wiring that needs to be broken. Gemini and Copilot are great/good in some ways, but I've found that training staff on just those three native LLMs first (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) is more effective for seeing the light. Google NotebookLM has a lot of fans. I like to walk teams through it because it's a good way to reinforce what a knowledge base is, like we do with the custom GPTs. Also, the automated audio and video podcasts are crowd pleasers, especially with the new Join function where users can engage directly with the agentic podcast hosts. People don't seem to want to read anymore. This was a rude awakening for us when we first launched the AI Roadmap with a series of online training materials. We now know we need to deliver short video instruction if we want anyone to actually look at the educational content. People love Descript for AI-powered video creation. Once we started showing how to use Descript, we were pleasantly surprised to see how staff really leaned in. Teaching Descript provides a fun break early in the process because people can see pretty amazing results in minutes and wrap their minds around the process fairly easily. Ask all staff to share how they're using AI effectively and where they see AI failing them. Catalogue the case studies and share across the organization to accelerate learning, inspire a healthy sense of internal competition, and track learning over time. Staff members are also often wowed seeing AI agents in action. We use n8n to develop agents, where you can create a lot of basic automated workflows quickly. Once a few early adopters see how agents can take over some of their more tedious, time-consuming tasks, others will jump in. Feedback Loop & Funding/Board Support This line in the AI Roadmap is broken down into tactical internal optimization and more strategic, consumer-facing and revenue-generating sales, marketing and stakeholder engagement. I don't have a lot to share for this section and the following one because our focus to date has been mostly on the above phases. Feedback Loop The reason we record every engagement with AI Roadmap clients is to scale learning, so if one person learns something, everyone can benefit. That will be further multiplied when we starting sharing takeaways across DMOS, and eventually the industry as a whole. Visit Mesa, Tourism Richmond and Visit Florida Keys are eager to lead this initiative, and we plan to launch a new AI thought leadership framework collectively in 2026. Funding & Board Support The spark that led to developing the AI Roadmap happened almost a year ago when a board member for a large DMO told me that she viewed AI integration as merely a tactic. If this work can elevate AI in the minds of board members toward a more high-level strategic imperative, then we'll have achieved part of our mission. There's still some work to be done first though to collect more case studies showing direct AI business outcomes before we can make a more solid case for additional funding for AI integrations. AI Strategic Plan We've produced a mockup of what we think an AI Strategic Plan will eventually look like, but it's too early to show presently. For now, we've identified three overarching pillars, each with potential strategies, action items, timelines and targets. The KPIs are crucial, of course, for scaling AI strategy across the travel industry. Right now, we're thinking the three pillars might look like the following, although this is all up in the air right now: Optimize Internal Operations & Knowledge: The strategies include cleaning up internal folders/files to improve AI outcomes in general and develop AI agents specifically. A lot in here on training, experimentation, overall adoption, success measures, etc. Increase Partner Revenue with Agentic AI: Defining how DMOs develop AI agents to fuel agentic commerce is the big goal overall with the AI Roadmap. Initial strategies in this pillar begin with more low hanging fruit though, such as website redevelopment, optimizing for AI SEO, AI chat integration, etc. Expand Community Collaboration: We're seeing more DMOs take a leading role in AI education for their industry and community stakeholders. The 2050 City Roadmap is perfectly suited for informing how DMO leaders can facilitate community AI workshops and increase the organization's overall relevance and value. Greg Oates

Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Kara Franker , president and CEO of The Florida Keys & Key West tourism organization, was among the first DMO leaders to embrace AI platforms and processes in 2023 when she was chief executive at Visit Estes Park in Colorado. In May 2024, Franker published two papers on AI strategy and policy: From the Base of the Rocky Mountains to the World: A case study through Visit Estes Park’s journey into Generative AI solutions — and how your DMO can carve its own AI path Navigating AI and the Law in the Travel Industry: An Introduction to Legal Implications for DMOs The first paper highlights how Visit Estes Park integrated GuideGeek AI chat into their website and three Meta platforms: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The DMO also branded the chat Rocky Mountain Roamer to give it an identity and bit of personality. The second paper focused on AI policy and data privacy, security and compliance. Franker, who is an attorney, co-wrote that with Roxanne Steinhoff , also an attorney at Steinhoff Law, who leads the firm’s destination marketing and sports tourism practice. I caught up with Franker to see how her perspectives on AI strategy and policy are evolving almost a year later. Greg Oates: You've been leading AI strategy in tourism for almost two years beginning with your work at Visit Estes Park. However, there’s still a lack of AI training today specific for DMO CEOs, and many leaders are presently unsure how to proceed with AI. As a CEO, what’s your take on that? Kara Franker: I'm not surprised that there's a lack of training because there's just so much for everybody to wrap their heads around. I think some people are trying to watch and wait and see. My philosophy has been more of a fall-forward, fail-forward kind of approach. That's why I put the white papers out. Anybody could learn from what we had done, and do it better. You know, a case study is sometimes the best way to figure this stuff out, so that's why we did it. The second paper on AI policy was with Roxanne Steinhoff on the legal and ethical implications of AI. Because when I would go and speak in front of groups, those were always the big questions from the leadership. They don't know how far is too far once you open this can of worms. That's why we got together and started to put guardrails in place that we thought might make sense for people to study, just as a first stab at it. That all launched last summer, so I do think that there's a little bit of education out there but we could definitely use more. GO: What do DMOs need to know about AI policy at a very high level in terms of privacy and security? KF: Employee and client information should be kept private and not uploaded into any AI tools. That could be a big deal, thinking of all the different rules and regulations about collecting information, especially how it's more stringent in Europe than in the United States. That can cause potential problems if you're uploading, say, a client list that has personal cell phones, email addresses or other information that people just don't want out there. So, it's really more about information that's attached to a person. And then, is there competitive data that you don't necessarily want others to have? Possibly, but so much of what we do in the DMO space is public anyways so the lines for that are pretty blurry. I’m trying to imagine a scenario where a DMO is, like, basically hacking somebody else's information through AI. I can’t imagine that’s worth the time and effort, or even possible. GO: A few months ago we were discussing what AI tools might be available for DMO departments like HR and accounting to help with privacy, compliance, efficiency, etc. But everything available seems to be enterprise grade and out of reach for DMOs. So what’s the answer for scaling AI across an organization? KF: I think this is a huge need. I hired somebody from Cisco who’s my new VP of technology and partnerships. She's a total AI nerd like I am, and way more qualified to dive into all this. She and I have been looking at different options to put together, almost like little plugins. We really, really need this. For example, how do we take an AI solution from the legal world to analyze all our contracts so that we don't have to spend as many hours with attorneys, because we really just need a template, right? And then for HR, same thing. How do we organize all our employee files into a much more streamlined and effective system? And then there’s our policies. We're a nonprofit but everything we do is so heavily influenced by County government. We have so many compliance issues, so I want an AI to learn every single piece of County policies so we’re able to compare and contrast what we're doing with those policies. I haven't been able to find anything to help with these things. We've looked at a lot of different options but it's like what you're saying. They're these big enterprise pieces built for law firms or financial people, and they’re all really expensive. None of them fit the mold for improving different operations at a DMO. In my mind, the marketing side is covered, especially with GuideGeek, and there are so many great options now for everything involved with marketing. So I feel like that's been tackled and done really well. But for the operations, we need more. I mean, we’ve just got to keep digging deeper, I think. GO: When you and your technology person from Cisco figure all this out, will you share what you find with the rest of us? KF: Of course, always. GO: Backing up a bit, you were arguably the very first DMO CEO to lean into AI, at least in North America, when you were with Visit Estes Park. How did you convince your board that investing in AI was important at the time, and what were some of your processes with bringing along staff? KF: We were fortunate in the sense that the board was all in and the staff were all in. And I don't mean to make age a part of it, but the staff was a little on the young side and they were all very ambitious. Everybody wanted to try to figure it out. So we made the argument to the board, if we could figure out some of what AI could do, it would make the community stronger and they could take pieces of it back to their businesses. There wasn't really anybody who was against experimenting and trying it out. We made some mistakes along the way and we put that in the white paper. Also, when we first rolled out GuideGeek, which scrapes the website, we found a few holes in our content. There were particular board members who didn't have very robust information about their business, so they got a little bit mad, but not in a, like, burn it down way. It was more of, "Oh, okay, we have some work to do." So part of the AI process has to actually be community outreach. It can't just be about the technology. We have to talk to all our partners and get really robust information from them, so when the AI crawls the site it gets the best possible information about our partners. GO: One thing you did at Visit Estes Park was brand your GuideGeek AI as Rocky Mountain Roamer on your website and three Meta platforms. We use that as a case study a lot, and emphasize that a DMO should promote their AI just like any other channel, right? KF: Definitely. We knew we had to put money behind marketing the tool if we wanted people to interact with it. Traditionally with a DMO, one of your calls to action is to send people to the website. Our new call to action for a lot of our campaigns back then was to send people to the AI, so we called it Rocky Mountain Roamer to help promote and drive traffic to it. And then in terms of KPIs, we wanted to track all the interactions you can see in the backend, but not just how many people used it. We wanted to know how long people interacted with the AI, what their journey was, and what they were asking about because that’s where things get really interesting. GO: After the initial thrill of launching GuideGeek, how did you manage how staff used AI internally? Were there any incentives involved to help spur adoption and experimentation? KF: The incentive for my team was, well, it wasn't really an incentive. It was a requirement. They had to write weekly reports for me about how they tested something with AI, whatever it was. It could apply to their job or not, I didn't really care. So I almost forced them to try AI. But then people started really getting into it. They were getting more and more user friendly with different AI tools, and they would be like, “Oh, I like Anthropic because of this or that,” because they were branching out from just using ChatGPT. So, yeah, there has to be almost like a culture of AI in your DMO for it to really work, and it's on the CEO to create and foster that. Greg Oates

Join Matador Network's AI Playground at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix Jul 26 Written By Greg Oates Matador Network, GuideGeek AI and U.S. Travel are launching the inaugural "AI Playground" at ESTO 2025 in Phoenix, August 17-19. The educational space, hands-on demo area, genius bar and live sessions will run all three days during the conference. We are also producing programming specific for travel industry CEOs, along with other sessions dedicated for senior executives, highlighting actionable AI strategies focusing on real world business outcomes. Leading up to ESTO, I'll be reaching out to many of you requesting any AI-related success stories and/or questions you might have for the AI Playground. Looking back over the last two years, it's clear the industry is turning a corner in 2025 when it comes to AI learning and adoption. Many DMOs and their industry partners are now integrating AI processes and platforms across their organizations, whereas last year many destination leaders were still in wait-and-see mode. For those of you still on the fringes, it is our ambition that the AI Playground will plant a flag in the ground showing how AI is now a proven strategy for helping DMOs further deliver on their mandate. "AI is clearly powering the future of travel and how people explore the world today," says Ross Borden, founder and CEO of Matador Network. "We are stoked to be working with U.S. Travel and investing in our industry to produce the AI Playground. AI will become standard operating procedure for every DMO soon, and we're excited to help lead this journey." DMO CEOs on AI Strategy Matador launched its proprietary GuideGeek AI chat platform for DMO websites and social media channels almost two years ago. We now have more than 40 DMOs onboard, and we're expanding the scope of GuideGeek AI with new hotel groups and tour operators joing in recent months. Based on our experience working with municipal, regional and national organizations across the global visitor industry, we have unparalleled insights into how conversational AI is changing the relationship between destinations and visitors, as well as how DMOs operate internally. In preparation for ESTO 2025, we launched this GuideGeek Destination AI newsletter in January to ramp up our industry outreach and further expand our understanding of how DMO leaders are navigating the rise of AI. Here are five stories from the newsletter that inform high-level decision making related to AI strategy, with input from more than 15 CEO DMOs: What Tourism CEOs Want to Know About AI : Our first post with 12 DMO CEOs highlighted the wide range of questions they have. One asked for the five big AI questions he should know about. Another wants practical advice on five AI initiatives that he can implement, like, tomorrow. Destination Vancouver CEO on AI Leadership in Tourism : CEO Royce Chwin, who helms Destination Vancouver, shared why his organization was one of the first DMOs in the world to dive into AI. Destination Toronto & Visit Denver CEOs on the 5 Big AI Questions in Tourism : Two chief executives, Andrew Weir in Toronto and Richard Scharf in Denver, worked out what they believe are the five big AI themes/questions that DMOs need to focus on, as touched on in the first post. Florida Keys Tourism CEO on Leading AI Innovation : Newly installed Florida Keys CEO Kara Franker, who is also an attorney, shed light on AI policy, compliance and the need for more non-enterprise AI solutions for her organization. Visit Mesa CEO Launches New DMO AI Road Map : Another visionary DMO chief executive, Visit Mesa leader Marc Garcia is bringing a new level of structure and direction for integrating AI processes and platforms. Next up, Matthias Schultze, managing director of the German Convention Bureau, will be discussing AI strategy from a business events perspective. I also met with Cody Chomiak, vice president of marketing at Travel Manitoba, who's really lighting a fire in Canada around AI thought leadership and adoption. He'll be sharing a few powerful AI case studies from his provincial marketing organization, both internal and visitor-facing. AI Playground at ESTO 2025 The AI Playground this year will feature three stations at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge . We will have our Matador GuideGeek team and U.S. Travel staff on hand to guide participants through the space, along with some invited AI experts from around the industry. We'll be digging into a handful of paid AI models including ChatGPT Plus/Teams, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro, Google AI Pro, Microsoft Copilot Pro and Manus. We'll show how AI is best navigated at DMOs by bucketing strategy into three unique categories: Search, Create and Sales. Specific use cases will include content generation and data analysis, AI SEO and AI-optimized web development, AI policy and governance, staff adoption, building custom GPTs for sales proposals, and automated workflows and AI agents, among others. The three stations are: The Prompt Lab welcomes all attendees to come in and test drive various AI models. The interactive, hands-on learning station will have multiple laptops for experimenting with AI tools for people of all skill levels. We'll have a bunch of paid AI models pre-loaded for live demos and one-on-one conversations showing how AI actually works and some of what it accomplishes across different departments. Feel free to bring your own laptop if you like. The Genius Bar is designed for individual and group Q&A about real world AI strategy, implementation and ROI. We'll be collecting all the questions posed to share with the broader industry afterward, so we'll have a couple crowdsourcing boards to help generate new ideas and explore new solutions. Reach out to me if you want to schedule time to talk during ESTO. The AI Theater seating area will host a range of AI-focused dialogues, micro-presentations and a few dedicated sessions designed for CEOs, as well as other senior executives. The programming schedule for all those will engagements be included in the ESTO agenda. Most importantly, all the conversations at the AI Playground will highlight tangible AI case studies and specific business outcomes. The 5 Big Questions About AI One of the best things to come out of all the interviews with DMO CEOs this year is our list of the five big AI questions that chief executives need to focus on. These questions will likely evolve a bit, but for now they're providing direction for how we're developing the AI Playground and how DMOs are moving forward with AI integration. How do we channel our staff's enthusiasm for AI, who have wildly different perspectives and capabilities related to AI, to elevate our organization’s impact in our industry and community? How do we create AI policy that serves and protects our organization but doesn't suppress wonder and experimentation among staff? How does AI benefit all our departments, versus just marketing, and how do we measure improvements in productivity, creativity and overall quality of work? How do we redevelop our websites and content to rank higher in AI search? How do we capitalize on conversational AI to influence travel purchase decisions and in-destination visitor behavior? I would love to hear your feedback on any the above and how we can make the ESTO 2025 AI Playground as valuable as possible for you and your teams. Reach out at greg@matadornetwork.com . Greg Oates
